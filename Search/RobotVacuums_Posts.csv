Roomba j7+ alternatives?I'm looking for a new vacuum to replace our Xiaomi Mi Vacuum for my 1200 sq/ft 2 bedroom condo. We have a dog and usually have to empty the dust bin 2-3 times a session so we want a vacuum with an auto-empty dock. I'm not interested in mopping and it would be really nice to have image recognition to avoid cables/cords. It looks like I could get a refurbished Roomba J7+ for about $500. Are there any other options out there that I should be considering?

"Do you trust your robot?I just got a Deebot, and I let it map my flat for the first time. I followed it around the whole time. I have a cat and dog, and I was worried about them attacking it. I also wasn't sure if it would get suck or find something that would get caught like a shoelace or some hidden cord. 

Did you trust your robot right away to just do the job without worry? Is this kind of robot anxiety normal? 

Do you robot-proof your home before cleaning?

How often do you clean?

With that said, it was like magic to watch the thing go under a chair, and almost get stuck, but figure out an elegant way out. Very cute."
Send Shark ultraAI robot in for maintenance?Is there any company that does MX on these products? I don't trust myself to take this thing apart but it absolutely needs a good once-over. I have done basic maintenance on it but I need someone to help get it back to good condition.
"This is a serious question -- Is there a Robovac that doesn't suck? As in, it works consistently.I'm a believer in Robovacs and I desperately want to find one that works. But I have had terrible luck so far. 

First I had a Neato D7. It was awful. It constantly had issues with mapping, had a sensor malfunction, and it never ended up working as I wanted it to. I ended up getting it repaired under warranty, and it had issues again with mapping and just randomly stopping during jobs and saying it was done or saying sensors were dirty or something. Then Neato made a new app that only supported the latest devices and abandoned the old one. I eventually just stopped using it because the issues were not worth the time. 

So, I replaced it with an ECOVACS N8+ last year. It has a pretty good app (way better than the Neato app) and physically the device felt like it was built better. Well, the auto-empty bin flat out doesn't work because of a design flaw (this is well documented). Not a big deal because I probably wouldn't have used it as I don't want to buy proprietary bags. But what is a big deal, is that the vacuum just doesn't really work. It constantly has issues following the map and always needs to re-map the house. It stops in the middle of jobs for no reason or again, has issues with sensors. 

So......the point of this post is this: Is there a high-quality robovac that will just work consistently without me haven't to constantly reset it, re-map, and just overall spend time getting the thing to work? I don't trust reviewers anymore because the 2 robovacs I have bought are highly rated so I'm looking for opinions from non-reviewers."

"Call for help from robot vacuum reviewersHi! I've been procrastinating getting other people to help with the wiki/sidebar and I feel bad about that. I would love to get this stuff updated, but I mainly read other people's work and don't test myself. Please comment here if you're interested and why you're qualified. Also, feel free to let me know if you have suggestions on layout, etc. I'm personally thinking of a few key sections:

* Youtubers/reviewers that we trust – potentially adding any caveats we've seen from the community along with reaching out to the reviewers to see if they have any comment
* A comprehensive and updated list of robot vacuums with their features and recommended/not
* Useful articles/videos we've seen
* A ""help me chose a robot vacuum"" template and automod (this would include things like ""I want auto empty, but not a mop""

Edit: also lmk if you are a reviewer that gets paid for reviews, we'll need to chat about how to make sure this page is not abused."
"What would you recommend?I'm looking for a robot vacuum for my house, we have a lab that sheds like crazy and I can't keep up with it by myself. Our house is 80% medium pile carpet, but our hardwood has some rugs throughout.  My budget is around $600, so far my top picks are the Roomba J8+ (from Costco) or the Roborock Q7 Max+. But I'm open to any other suggestions. Mopping is not a must have since my house is mostly carpet, but would be nice. Thanks."

"Shark Clean App deleted all my settings and historyShark R101AE worked fine for a week. It had a daily schedule that started at 8:00 AM. Last night I heard it chime around midnight, but it didn't do anything so I thought nothing of it. This morning around 8:15 I noticed it wasn't cleaning so I looked at the app. Schedule was missing and disabled as well as the map and history. The robot was still paired to my account and seems to work fine now that I have reenabled everything. It acts like it has a map, though, there is no longer a map option anywhere in the app.

It seems to be working fine, but now I can no longer trust that it will work unattended when I'm away during the day."
"Narwal Freo vs dreametech L10As the title says, I was wondering if you guys had any ideas on the Narwal Freo vs the Dreamtech L10s Ultra.

Based on stated features, 1 difference I see between the Freo and Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra is that the Dream empties its dustbin. I have a iRobot Roomba i3 with the auto emptying base and the Cordey without an auto emptying bin... I do forget to empty Cordey sometimes and it doesn't clean when I forget to empty it... I have the mop attachment, but it does get dirty and it's just dragging the cleaning pad around even after being dirty.

Based on the stated features of the Dream and Freo, both have spinning brushes, both lift the brushes when on carpet, both have dirty and clean chambers for cleaning the brushes, both use heat to dry the brushes... The only difference (which I really like) is that the Dream auto empties the dustbin...

I only don't know much about the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra and their brand. I don't know how well they are at mapping and the obstacle avoidance compared to the stated good of the Narwal Freo. Based on the readings I've done, the Freo is pretty smart and is a really good robot vacuum. The only downside is the lack of auto emptying...

I guess I want to know if anyone had any experience with any Dreamtech products (like the W10 or something) and can say how good the app and features are. I don't want to shell out a ton of $ on an item only to wish I got the Freo even though it lacks the auto empty bin. I just am not always there, and I can't run the Roomba when I'm not home as it likes to get stuck...a lot... I'd do Cordey, but I have to get some magnet strips to tell it not to go in certain places as it doesn't get stuck unless it gets physically stuck under furniture that's too tight for it to fit under. Roomba just randomly gets ""stuck"" on nothing, and if I'm gone for say a couple of days, I can't auto empty Cordey or Freo, and those would have been the only 2 I would have trusted to run while I'm not home.

&#x200B;

So, does anyone have the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra, or any Dreamtech products? Are they any good? I'm really trying to compare to the Narwal Freo as it's the alternative for me. For all I know, I may just wait until the next Black Friday... I can't believe the prices...but I only just learned about those today. The different Narwals first, then the Dreamtech's Dream Bot  So, any help would be great. You will have some time. I'll try not to impulse buy any of them until I hear about them both. Narwal would have been a no brainer had it had the auto empty feature. I need to see more reviews on the Dreamtech's Dream Bot to decide if it's good or not...

&#x200B;

Also...anyone who has the Narwal Freo...Have you tried refilling the detergent with your own cleaning solution? Has it worked? Was it easy to do?  I have a cleaner I use on my wood floors that I usually put in my Cordey that's for wood floors. Was seeing if I could put that in there, or maybe not. It's concentrated wood cleaner, so I'd have to mix it with water if anything anyway. "
"Buying my very first robot vacuum and I need some help!Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some real help from some real people. 

TL;DR (I’m putting this here for those who don’t want to read the entire long post): I’m trying to choose a robot vacuum from Amazon, it must be able to pick up human hair and dog fur from tile floors. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so I have never owned a robot vacuum before but I have wanted one for a long, long time. Now that Amazon is having a sale and I have about $300 in amazon credit, this seems like the best time to get one. Only problem is there are so many options and I have been sitting here reading reviews for hours and I can’t decide because of course the reviews are all conflicting and confusing. I think I’ve narrowed it down to two but I am open to any other suggestions if there’s something you think is better (I do have some wiggle room on the price, as I’d like one that will work and also last). So here’s what I’m looking at now:

1. Roomba i4 + EVO ($400 with prime deal & comes with a free 3rd gen echo dot / listed price $667.98)
2. Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL ($400 / list price $600)

I live in a 2 bdrm/2bath apartment, approximately 1000sq ft. I’m a single parent with a teenager and a fluffy little yorkie mix. We all shed. Between the 3 of us, we shed a lot! There is always hair and fur everywhere. I hate vacuuming and you know the teen won’t do it so I think it would be nice to have one of these around to help me out a bit. We are quite messy, which is also part of why I put off buying one of these for so long but I’m hoping that having this will motivate us to pick up our shoes/clothes/etc off the floor. I’m tired of living in an apartment full of clutter and hair/fur. Would be great to be able to walk around barefoot in my house. I have a bona for washing the floors but it doesn’t work as well when there’s hair everywhere! Oh almost forgot to add, our apartment is all tile, no carpet or rugs.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is that it can handle picking up all the hair and fur without clogging up or anything. Ill be honest, I am not at all familiar with the Shark brand. I’ve wanted a Roomba forever but I think it’s just because it’s the one I’ve heard the most about. But I’m not going to make a choice based on name recognition alone. For all I know, the Shark is just as good or even better than the Roomba. One thing that makes me lean more towards the Shark is that it’s bagless and the Roomba bags are costly. On Amazon, I found a package of 3 replacement bags for $20 and another package with all the other replacement parts for $55. I could not find the Shark replacement filters on Amazon or even by googling it so idk the cost of those; all I found were off brand replacement parts that claim to fit but have mixed reviews on whether they actually do. Also, I’m not sure if it’s safe to use off brand replacement parts. But im clueless about this so if people who know more about it tell me it’s fine then I’m fine with it. I just worry if something goes wrong with a bad part then it will break the vacuum. Regardless, I won’t need to buy bags for the Shark so I assume it will cost less as far as replacements go. Other than that, both of these seem pretty good.

Of course, both have pros and cons. Also, both have an average of 4.3 stars on Amazon. I really just can’t read any more reviews or my head will explode. I don’t know if I can trust random websites who get a percent of every sale; I feel like this just incentives them to try to sell you on a more expensive product rather than what’s really best for you. And I honesty can’t tell what is going on with amazon reviews. I saw several reviews that made no sense. Someone actually wrote “I love it, but it leaves behind clumps of hair” (and many others are very similar to this, with 5 stars but a lot of negative stuff in the actual review). I don’t understand it… why do you love it if it isn’t doing its job? What do you love about it? Are you even a real person? Did someone pay you to put 5 stars but they don’t care what you actually write in the body of the review? I feel like either I’m going crazy or the world is or possibly both. 

So yeah, I need help. I hope there are people here who can help me. I really appreciate any and all information, suggestions, etc. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. You are true heroes!"

"Cleaning liquids for robot washingHi, I just bought a dreame d10 plus. In the instructions there is written to refill the water tank only with water and don’t use disinfectant.

I don’t really trust the manual, I wanna use some detergent 😅 (I am a bit sure they don’t want to use bleach cause it may destroy the water pump and it is correct, but I want to remove some greasy dust).

I am just trying with demineralized water and normal floor detergent the result is good. I am oleò going to try with car glass cleaner liquid, but…

Which kind of liquid you use to clean floor with your cleaning robot?"

"roborock q7 max plus?I can't find much on this robot.

I have a long hair dog (eufy does terribly with it).
No carpets, but wood with bumps between rooms and I tend to be messy (eufy getting stuck constantly).
I have dust and dog allergy :(

I found roborock q7 max plus which is a little out of budget.. or roomba i3+
Stretching more i7+ if really really worth.. already the roborock would be outside budget.

I don't mind much for mopping (don't trust it would be great), but I need HEPA and absolutely emptying dust bin.

Thoughts?

I am mainly concerned they aren't able to go between rooms because in two there a couple of cm bump.. but ok probably can't do anything about it.

Thanks!!"
Roidme Eva vs Robock S7Anyone have thoughts on the Roidme Eva? Its pretty cheap and has cleaning of the mop built in. Not sure if its just a prototype or something since its on Indiegogo only. There seems to be a bunch of paid for videos on YouTube but not much else genuine reviews on it online. How is it compared to the Roborock S7?
"Deciding between Deebot N8 Pro+, Neabot N2 or Roborock S7+ for a medium heavily carpeted houseMy house is a multi-level house with each floor being about 500ft^2 (50m^2 ish) and is mostly carpeted. On the bottom floor, the kitchen and bathroom is hardwood but it's <15% of the area, whereas the upper floor it's only the bathrooms. 

I want something that meets the following requirements:

1.  Uses LIDAR. I don't trust iRobot's privacy with cameras
2. Has no-go zones
3. Has an auto-emptying bin
4. Works great on carpet and hardwood for vacuuming.

I don't care about mopping at all. 

So I've narrowed it down to the ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+, the Neabot N2  or the Roborock S7+.

I'm having a hard time deciding between the three. The S7+ seems the best but it is nearly $1000. The reviews for Ecovacs on Amazon make it seem like it's better for hardwood. Neabot seems to have great reviews and is significantly cheaper, but it is also a brand new company and I'm not sure how it will perform in the long run."
How often should Viomi S9 self-empty?I bought Viomi S9. Vacuuming & mopping & mapping works very nicely. Tried several runs so far. But now it happened it returned from vacuuming to the station and it did not empty itself. Is this a fault? Does it normally empty itself after EVERY run? Or does it have a smart way to know that the amount of dust is not so huge so it will maybe just empty itself after several runs or something like that? Manual says in broken english that it should empty itself after any run longer than 1 minute but I am not sure if the Chinese manual can be trusted. Better to hear from real users...

"Best robot for avoiding cat vomit?One of my cat's vomits a lot.  She's been to the vet multiple times, she's on meds for it, but she still pukes a couple times a week.

We have all hard surface flooring (mostly lvp), with the occasional throw rug and 2 floors.  I don't need mopping, but I wouldn't mind it.  Auto Empty is more important to me.  I don't have a budget, but lets call it $1500 to cover all products.  I just want something i don't have to worry about.

I would think an ai camera would be the best here for vomit?  So something like the aivi, samsung ai bot, the roomba with an AI camera, etc. 

Any suggestions for what would be the best robot vacuum for me?  I'm currently leaning towards the samsung model or the roomba."
"Looking for a bot to adoptHi everyone,

Been looking before posting and didn't see anything related to this.

We  have a good duo of Roombas at work and they do a great job (vet clinic,  7 women, I let you imagine the amount of hair and dust they have to  deal with). Really pumped up by Bob & Ike (our roombas) and their  performance,  I'm looking forward into buying a vaccum robot friend to  help me keep the house clean.

Only  problem so far : I have a big ass sofa on relatively short feet : 8,5cm  (3,35in). I would have loved to adopt a Roomba, but they are all around  9,5cm (3,74in).  I've seen some models that are ""ultra slim"" with 5,5  to 8cm (2,17 - 3,14 inches), but often some obscure brands on Amazon  (and i'm not so open with the idea of my data being stored in an unknown  company's servers).

They also  tend to all have a wet cleaning feature (which I really don't need imo),  not sure if it's bullshit, if it only takes out dust, or if it really  cleans the floor well. What's your opinion on this ? If it works, any  pet-friendly detergent I can put in it ?

So my dream bot would be :

\- With an app **and secured/trusted servers** / Without an app but with a remote (no random-only mode, I don't want my bot to act like an old blind & deaf Dachshund).- From a trusted/reliable brand- 8cm (3,14in) tall or under (the hardest part)- With central rotative extractor (one or two brushes), as I don't really trust the simple vaccuming hole- Able to handle pet hairs (3 short haired cats)- (Optional)  with two lateral brushes- (Optional) with a square front end for corners

I know I'm asking a lot, but what would you recommend me with those criteria ?

(Done a lot for research too and only found the Deebot Ozmo Slim10 to answer to my wishes but at 850€ it's WAY above my budget)

Thanks to everyone who read this, best wishes to everyone for the upcoming year."

"Dreame Z10 Pro Robot Vacuum and Mop with DockHave you been spending hours and hours reviewing the same robot vacuums over and over to see which one you would like to spend your hard earned money on? Have you still not come to a conclusion yet? Well, I’ll come to that conclusion so you don’t have to!
Enough of the rhetoric, I cannot repeat this enough, but this wonderful machine has changed my life and in this review you’ll see how it can change yours too.

Firstly, I have to note that I have been sent this robot vacuum by Dreame, although I have been told that I can be honest in my review, as they care about the customer feedback and want to make the best possible products on the market.
Furthermore, I am going to write a small bit about me so you can understand the struggles I have with hoovering. I am 21, partially blind, I have psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Aspergers. I have been looking for months upon months, to try and find the best robot vacuum for the price. I cannot see small crumbs an dog hair on the floor so I get incredibly frustrated when it comes to hoovering up because I often miss a lot of debris on the floor and my mum, who works full-time, takes it upon herself to help me do it, and as much as I love my mother, I don’t want to rely on her in that way and I don’t want to take up anymore of her precious time. This is where the good bit comes, I have been eyeballing Dreame’s products for a while and luckily for me, they sent one out to me to show the world that if you struggle like me, this is the perfect robot vacuum for you, whether you have disabilities or just want that added comfort of not having to do the hoovering in your house, because this robot can do it all! 

Upon receiving this product, I noticed that the materials used and the packaging provided was incredibly well put together. I took out the beast-of-a-hoover and right then and there I knew I was going to enjoy hoovering for once. All that you need to do, when taking the hoover out of the box is put in the little spinning brush, it click in with ease and trust me if I can do it, then you can too. 
The product I received came with the docking station, and my oh my it is a wonderful contraption at that, I’ll come back to that a little later. After the small assembly, all I had to do was plug in the dock, ‘press the return to dock’ button on the hoover itself and off it went and rolled up the dock and started charging itself!

I will be honest, I’m currently in a homeless hostel waiting to get my own place, so I am unable to talk about the Wi-Fi connectivity and the app in thorough detail. However, I had a little look and it seems very easy and simple to navigate, with zones you can set for the hoover to avoid, and detailed maps that you can label, so in future you could probably say ‘Alexa hoover kitchen’ lets say and it’ll go and do it for you. There is other benefits of the app I’m sure, but like me, you don’t even have to use the app, all I do right now is press the power button, take the dog for a walk and I return to a lovely, freshly hoovered flat. This is all done through the Xiaomi Home app, which if you don’t know, is an extremely useful app for other devices, such as Xiaomi scooters and other utilities that use the same app. If I’m not mistaken, you can also have up to 3 floor plans on the app as well, so you can take it upstairs and allow it to hoover, its not heavy at all either so don’t worry about pulling your lower back out. 



This bot is one of very few that used LIDAR as well as vSLAM, which in basic terms means that it uses both cameras and sensors, as well as lasers to gather insightful information such as detailed mapping of a room, as well as which obstacles to avoid. It is honestly a sight to behold, especially when you see it avoid something such as the dog  or a dog toy, and it does this all in real-time, it’ll have the maps taken beforehand as a template, but it’ll detect objects on the fly, and this is what makes this product so magnificent. This pinpoint-precision tech tells the hoover where to hoover and what lines to take in order to most efficiently and effectively vacuum. The suction is powerful, it cleans my carpets perfectly and gets those little crumbs, dirt that I can’t see, and even flakes of skin that shed due to my psoriasis too! Effectively the Dreame z10 pro has changed my life for the better.

One important thing to know,  is that this hoover is pretty good with dog hair, I have a Shiba Inu, which sheds a whole lot, and the hoover manages hair quite well, although after a month, you do have to detangle those stray hairs, but Dreame has thought of this and has provided a little detangling/brush tool underneath the back lid of the hoover itself. Furthermore, this little hoover gets into spots that some people with mobility problems will struggle to get into, such as under beds, sofas and tables, getting into those awkward spots so you don’t have to, saving your back in the mean time!

Now, onto the meat and potatoes of this product and why it stands out. The dock. Each bag lasts 60 days, I was given 2, though I think I read somewhere that you get 5, the bags will be available on amazon, and so far I’ve nearly reached 2 months and I still have room to spare, I usually hoover every day. Enough about the bags, onto the dock itself and believe me, you’ll want to purchase this hoover with the dock, it just makes sense! When the hoover has detected that its compartment is full, it goes and empties itself into the dock and then comes back and finishes where it left off, with no guidance or input needed at all and it just looks astounding, almost like a piece of art. If, you don’t buy the hoover with the dock, you’ll have to empty the hoover into a bin yourself and that’s quite arduous and finicky if you ask me, I don’t even know how you’ll charge the hoover without the dock. The obstacle avoidance is really good, it avoids dog toys and even wires, though sometimes it can go over smaller wires, but I’ve never seen wires wrap around the brush roller, so i believe there is a sensor next to the roller itself that detects wires and stops before it sucks them in.

Lastly, the mop is very good, I have a small kitchen and it does the job noticeably well. However, you have to keep taking the mop off and on as and when you want to mop, and in my case, if you’re using the reusable mop, you have to clean it every time, because it is that effective at mopping that it just gets full with dirt after one use. One improvement that could be made, is an automatic lifting device for the mop, so you don’t have to take it off when hoovering over carpets, it detects a carpet and a little motor lifts the whole mop up so your carpet doesn’t get wet, I’ve seen it implemented elsewhere, but paying nearly twice the price for a little lifting device for the mop isn’t worth it. One other small gripe I’d say, is that maybe Dreame could make a bag-less version in the future, so you can just empty the bin and not have to fuss around replacing bags every 2 months, and I would hope that these bags are bio-degradable. However, I’m being very nit-picky and it was very hard to find downfalls in this device, as it is very useful and life-changing for me especially. 

In conclusion, I believe that right now, for the money, this is the best hoover on the market, with the features you get. Even at full price this is a steal, but right now there is a limited early-bird price so definitely check around to see that price. If you’re someone with disabilities or limited mobility then you will greatly benefit from having the Z10, even if you have no disabilities and just want the added ease of coming back from work after a hard day, going on the app and telling your hoover to clean, you’ll come back to a nice hoovered home, which in turn means less stress for you, and to me, that is priceless. I am so thankful that Dreame has bestowed upon me this magnificent product and I hope that many of you enjoy it as much as I have, and that my review helps guide you into knowing which robot vacuum to buy, it is definitely worth it. This is a step into the future, that of autonomy and I’m happy to be a part of it. Dreame is a very forward thinking company and wants to help make peoples lives better as well as easier and I personally look forward to what they have to offer in the future, and you should too, so keep an eye out! I also love how Dreame values the customer, they listen to feedback and want to make the best products based on what the customer wants, and that is so valuable to me and all companies should be like that, I’m very thankful to Dreame for giving me this opportunity, and I hope that my review is appreciated.

"Robot vacuums and PrivacyI rarely see anyone discussing the privacy aspects of the robot vacuums here. I'm interested in purchasing a robot vacuum, but I'm also carfeul on what type of products I allow in my life. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Huawei. Xiaomi has shown lately how far they are willing to go to spy on your life and get every little detail about you, mostly in the effort to gain valuable data that they can use to sell more products to you or sell your data to other companies who can use that data in the same way.

I could see how a robot vacuum would be a perfect device to gain more information about an individuals household. So what do the experts on this thread have to say about the privacy when it comes to all of these robot vacuums?  
I know that some of you don't care about your own privacy, but for those who do, is there any way to keep your privacy intact when purchasing Robot vacuums? Are there any brands in particular who are better on the privacy side?"
"New 360 owner to help others.I'm posting this for others as a source of information for this brand/model. I recently purchased the 360 S7 Pro from Amazon. I previously had the Neato D4 which I returned due to its lack of features I was looking for in a robot vac.

As I researched what to buy before and after the D4 I found myself having trouble finding reliable sources of reviews or in the 360's case just reviews. After finding one S7 Pro review on YouTube (that seemed like a non paid spot) and a bunch S9 reviews, I decided to pull the trigger. This was decided mostly based on specs/features to price. At the time of my purchase it was $290 after $100 discount. For that I got all the app features of a modern bot vac, multi floor maps, no go zones for vac and mop, clean rooms in w/e order I want (this was a BIG factor to me), and the vac itself was 2650pa suction.

Performance wise 360 says it's equivalent to the Roborock S5 Max. Idk if that helps you but I never owned a RR, though I read a lot of reviews saying it's carpet performance is ehh. The S7 Pro does quite well on our low pile carpets. Actually it seems to pick up more then the Neato which is surprising since the Neato brush is almost twice as big. I guess that PA does come in handy. It cleans all surfaces very good, though I think I would prefer RR rubber side brush then the bristles. I'm debating a way to use those on the 360. Nothing a dremal couldn't handle.

The navigation has been 100% spot on. Especially compared to the Neato and its lost in a circle actions. If I tell it to do the Living Room at Max power 2x then the playroom at powerful power 2x then the hallway at normal suction 1x it does exactly that avoiding all possible obstacles. At 100% suction power it can clean each room twice before it needs to recharge. When you clean the room twice it will go north /south on the 1st run, then east /west on the 2nd. I find this is probably the most efficient way to clean. Before each pass it cleans the borders. 

The dust bin is avg size, I would prefer a larger bin but at this price range the size seems standard. Both the D4 and S7 Pro get over our kitchen threshold which measures .7in. Though the Neato seemed to have less trouble. Our kids are still young enough where gates are needed, neither vac made it over them. Which still requires me to remove the gate or pick up the vac. Still making the idea of a robot vacuum not fully realized in our household.. 

As of this posting the RR S4Max is down to $320, If I wanted I can return the 360 and buy that. I've decided that I'm looking at a downgrade across the board if I do. I'd only be getting a well known brand over a lesser one.

Both are Chinese made, along with the Deebot and basically every brand on Amazon minus Irobot and Neato (Neato was American but was bought by a German company). I put my faith in the 360 and so far its paid off greatly! 

I will update this post if I see a need.

For reference we have 2 dogs and 2 kids."
"Better MOP s5max vs t8?Hi guys!
Can u help me understand which one is better from the mopping point of view only?

I have read everything and the opposite of everything...
That the t8 pro attachment is not that great, that the s5 clean better, but has thinner pad so it clean worst... 
I Don’t know who should I trust."
"Advice? 1 floor, ~1500sqft, mostly vinyl w/ area rugsHi all. I’m looking for my first robo vacuum. Every time I think I’ve decided what would be best I found a counter point, so I figured I’d just try asking. 

-Main goal is to reduce cat hair and clean up litter that gets kicked out of litter boxes. I have 3 cats and I’m hoping this can reduce their mess footprint a bit. I also have a girlfriend with long hair who honestly might shed more than the cats. 

-The vacuum will be used on one floor, run during the day while I’m at work, either every day or every other day. The layout, particularly for the living room, is a bit wonky with some weird angles for the walls and a decent amount of furniture. 

-Vast majority of the floor is vinyl plank with some low-pile area rugs. Mopping is not important to me

-This won’t be the only cleaning for my house, I still intend to vacuum on the weekends (unless it’s THAT good). More of just something to help keep up during the week

-Self-emptying would be nice but not super important

-Budget ideally under $500. I do have a Costco membership 

I’ve considered the Shark IQ RV1000S (though I then saw many said don’t trust vacuum wars rec for this), the roborock S4, the Roomba i3+, a standard i7, and a few others. Any advice would be super helpful. Thanks!"
"Buying Advice for a Newbie(Based in the UK for the sake of recommendations, prices etc)

I'm looking to purchase a RoboVac for my Basement Flat (single floor). It has a Living Room and Bedroom that is Carpeted, and a long Kitchen that is basically a corridor with appliances and such that is Tiled. There is a single step going down into the Bathroom which I must consider to avoid potential catastrophes. I'm not over fussed about the Bathroom, but if I could find a way to simply place it down and it run across it for 10-15 minutes, that'd be a bonus. I do not own any Pets nor do I plan to own any in the near future.

Having spoken with a family member who owns one, they recommended the [Cordey 750](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coredy-Vacuuming-Sweeping-Controls-Self-Charging/dp/B082W3RXQR/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=Coredy%20r750&qid=1625240622&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSjMyVFQ3MUREV1NYJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODMyMjQzMklKT0dJRjgyNDk3QSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDE1OTUzMklBTTBFWkNNVVVNMSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3Bob25lX3NlYXJjaF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&fbclid=IwAR3b9iJCcNM5QUXWNZhcoVQOYgM8DMu9UclOq4NDTMAD8ItNDTiC36G5Bqo)  that they purchased on Amazon Prime Day. Has the ability to swap attachments for Mopping, which according to her would work, as long as I close the Bedroom and Living Room doors. It has boundry strips that I can use on the step to prevent it from falling off the step. And a decent price point at £230 round about.

Is this a generally good recommendation based on my needs? Are there other options that might provide more benefits or better performance? Is the brand generally trusted? Looking for any and all advice on the matter to help a first time buyer commit to a model with confidence."
"Robot vac for hard wood, slate tile and low pile carpet...THREE cats...Hi, I’m looking for recommendations for a robot vac that would work well with SLATE tile, which is uneven (unlike traditional tile), as well as hardwood and low pile carpet. I have three cats so it must be good at grabbing hair and going along baseboards (since that’s where the fur always hides...). I don’t mind having to run it every day and I have a very large house with two floors but I’m not opposed to running it in a rotation of one or two high traffic rooms per day 5 days a week while I’m at work. I don’t care if I have to empty it every day as long as it does a good job picking things up.

"Vacuum Bot recommendation student householdDear redditors,

can anyone recommend a budget friendly (<500€) vacuum bot? Maybe a model that has been working great in your own household.

We have a 65m^(2) appartment, no pets, girlfriend that tends to lose lots of long hair.

The following aspects are important:

\- reliable

(We thought about getting the Dreame L10s Pro for example but because of the mopping technology there seem to be lots of cases of mop or water tank malfunction, which doesn't make automation a lot of fun)

\- good vacuum performance

\- decent mopping would be neat, but I'd be ok if this is out of our price range

\- station is a nice to have but not necessary.

&#x200B;

Some of our candidates are w10 ,l10s pro, z10 all from dreame. But it doesn't have to be this specifiy brand.

Unfortunately right now the roborock s8 base model is cheaper than the s7 where i live, otherwise I'd go for a s7, but my girlfriend is not happy with the price tag.

"Yo, Need Some Intel: Scoop on Buying a Second-Hand Robot Cleaner (Roborock or Others) - What Should I Keep My Eyes Peeled For?What’s poppin’, fam?

So, I’m on the hunt for a second-hand robot cleaner, specifically a Roborock or any other dope brand/model. I’ve been doing my homework and realized these bad boys can cost a pretty penny when bought brand spankin’ new. So, I figured I’d tap into the second-hand market and see what’s up.

But here’s the deal, I ain’t tryna get played. I wanna make sure I’m gettin’ a solid deal and a robot cleaner that’s gonna hold it down. That’s why I’m hittin’ up the Reddit fam for some guidance and wisdom.

If any of y’all got the lowdown on buying a second-hand robot cleaner, especially a Roborock or somethin’ similar, I’d appreciate your 411. What should I be lookin’ out for when snatchin’ up a used robot cleaner? Any specific features or specs I need to be keepin’ an eye on? And how do I know if the joint is legit and in good condition?

Here are a few questions I got brewin’, but feel free to drop any other tips or hacks:

	1.	What’s a fair price range for a second-hand robot cleaner like the Roborock? Should I be worried if the price seems too good to be true?
	2.	How crucial is it to know the age and usage history of the robot cleaner? Any common issues or maintenance drama I should watch out for with older models?
	3.	Are there any tests or checks I should be throwin’ down before sealin’ the deal? What signs of wear and tear or possible problems should I be scopin’ out?
	4.	Is it worth snaggin’ any kind of warranty or guarantee from the seller, considerin’ this is a second-hand buy? And how can I make sure I’m covered and not left hangin’?

I’m countin’ on y’all to drop some real knowledge bombs, share your own experiences, or dish out some solid recommendations. Help a homie out so I can make a smart move and score a reliable robot cleaner that won’t break the bank.

Much love and appreciation for all the help, my Reddit peeps! Stay fresh!"
"Looking for upgrade inputI have \~2400 sq ft to vacuum, mostly tile and wood, in some cases with rugs over same. I've had an Ecovacs T8+ for a few years, and while it works, it has all kinds of issues: It's constantly getting stuck between chair legs or in some kind of corner, finding cables or drapes to chew on, losing it's map, the auto-empty frequently fails to empty the dustbin, etc.  I'm fed up with the amount of babysitting it needs.  Also, the mopping is frankly pretty sad. It mops after a fashion, but even with the pro attachment I'm not convinced it does much other than make the floor damp. 

While the T8+ is miles better than no robot at all, but I'd like to see something close the gap between the idea of a robot vacuum and the reality - something that I can count on to do its job reliably (preferably while having a good vacuum performance to noise ratio and preferably being effective at mopping)

Roborock seems to be reputed to have the best software, so the S7 MaxV Ultra and S8 Pro Ultra are interesting, but the prices are pretty obscene. These things are 4-5x more than I paid for my T8+, and it seems all too easy to imagine that they'll be multiples more expensive while maybe only being incrementally better than what I have now.

If their navigation is trouble-free, the mopping is effective, and they have the longevity/repairability to serve for \~10 years, then I can see them justifying their price tag, but I'm not sure that's where things are actually at today. 

Bottom line - looking for input as to whether any robot vacuum is smart enough to get through its cycle without needing a rescue and whether any of them have effective mopping. Although my interest is pointed in the Roborock direction, any input is appreciated."
"Rowenta X-PLORER S75+ (Should I buy it ?)Hello,

I'm very new to this kind of technology, never seen a robot cleaner before and I'm looking for some advice about buying the above mentioned product. I know about some reliable companies such as Roborock, Xiaomi, Eufy, Roomb, etc... But I have never heard of Rowenta. It's a german company and the S75+ model looks pretty much similar to all other robot cleaners.

My initial go-to robot cleaner was Dreame d9, since I was looking for something around 150-200€ that has laser navigation. Reason I'm interested in Rowenta right now is because I can get the robot for around 280€ (discounted from 470€) and it comes with **self cleaning station**.

**The question here is, should I go for it ?**

The downside is that it has a smaller dust and water containers(around 260ml) but I'm not sure how important that is, since it empties the containers when it returns to the station. My apartment is around 70m^(2). I was thinking of maybe getting it and doing some test runs for a week and see how I'd like it - can return it in case it doesn't fit my needs.

Model: [Rowenta RR8587 X-Plorer S75+](https://www.amazon.de/Rowenta-RR8587-Absaugstation-Laser-Navigationssystem-Reinigungsmodi/dp/B0B8JBWFT7/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1JXMYRXQG89TM&keywords=ROWENTA%2BX-PLORER%2BSERIE%2B75%2BS%2B&qid=1685127909&sprefix=rowenta%2Bx-plorer%2Bserie%2B75%2Bs%2B%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-1&th=1) (~~470€~~ 280€ with a discount)

"Best robots with reliable mapping?Hi All

I'm about to return my Eufy X8 has half the time it cannot seem to position itself and start creating a new map.

I'm in the UK so Roborock is unfortunately not a ideal option due to warranty issues even if you do buy from abroad, I was set on a Ecovacs T8 however i've heard even that has buggy app and mapping sometimes.

Suggestions would be appreciated, at the moment i'm actually thinking whether its actually better just to get a simpler vacuum without mapping :("
"Need Help SelectingLooking for recommendations in a robotic vacuum that would best suit our needs. 

Home is single story, 1500 square feet. One pet that sheds a lot. Laminate throughout, with a couple rug runners. The laminate has been discontinued, so we live in fear of water penetrating it, it then bubbling, and having to replace the entire flooring in the home. Hence, I don’t think we really want a robot with a mopping feature; sounds like too much risk for water penetration. 

We currently have a Roomba 860 and don’t love it.  It’s dumb, scuffs the baseboards, gets stuck, needs constant emptying, doesn’t return to the dock, and is pretty underwhelming power wise. We’d spend as much as necessary for a reliable new vacuum. Any helpful suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as I’m about 20+ hours into reading reviews and still feel lost as to what is right for our situation."
"Shag Carpets and robot vacuumsI have seen this question all over the Internet (bc I have a shag rug/carpet)


I have done some testing on this and want this info out there for anyone that it can possibly help.


Eufy 35C - this was my first robot vacuum. It has no mapping and just randomly bounces off walls but it didn't have any problem with the shag carpet. Additionally since it was under 3 inches in height, it was able to get under my couch


360 robot S5 - this thing is a beast. It's lasted me several years now with no issues. The mapping, suction, and reliability is great. It also handles the shag carpet with no problem. Only downside is that it doesn't auto empty but I don't care since it's the only vacuum I know of that can handle shag and has mapping. 


Deebot n8+ - this thing sucks, and not In a good way. Has trouble getting to its base. Decent suction. The mopping function is useless. It can't get onto the shag by itself. It's pattern of cleaning seems insane. Not efficient.


Roborock q5 - good mapping and pattern of cleaning. Suction wasn't great. Can't get onto shag. 


Tldr: if you have a shag carpet, get a eufy 35c (if you don't care about mapping) or a 360 robot s5 (if you want great mapping and better suction)"
"ISO of a reliable robot vacuum that DOESN’T require Wi-Fi access- do they exist?!My first robot vacuum was a Neato with a screen on top and a couple of buttons that you used to schedule cleanings, read error messages, etc. It was so simple, user-friendly and it we never had any issues with it. 

Eventually it died and I’ve since been through two pieces of crap, one was a Neato D3 and the other an Ecovacs Deebot. Neither had screens and required Wi-Fi access just to be able to start the damn things, let alone trying to figure out any error messages. 

We live in the country and our Wi-Fi sucks so it was a pain in the ass to get either of them to work reliably. I’d like to find one that doesn’t require Wi-Fi at all but I can’t seem to find any, it’s like they don’t even exist anymore. 

FWIW, we have mostly hardwood floors but some rug/carpet and a couple of cats. 

Any ideas?

"Any opinions on the Shark AI Ultra or the Eufy L35 Hybrid?* Both options are from Costco, the Eufy is $380 and the Shark is $320 (on sale from $400).

* The Eufy is a hybrid so it comes with a mop function, but obviously not self-filling / cleaning.
* Both use Lidar. 
* The Eufy was released mid 2022, the Shark was released late 2021.

I've had a D5, D7, Roomba 960, i7+ and the s5. The s5 has given me the fewest issues out of the bunch. Am I asking too much of a robot to run every evening or am I just having bad luck? Thankfully all of the others have me issues or failed relatively early so returning them or getting a replacement wasn't a big deal.

* Customer support - how easily I be able to get help if I run into problems?

"How does Samsung Samsung VR10F71 NaviBot (SR10F71UB) hold up against new models these days?Hi all,

a friend gave me his Samsung NaviBot since he does not use it anymore and after an initial test I was hooked. Little stuff left here and there but overall it was a pretty decent experience especially following that small adorable fellow with its cute little arms around while it was doing its job.

Now the actual question: How does it hold up against the modern versions of vacuum robots? Is it considered fully outdated and performing worse than even the entry level robots nowadays or is it a viable option considering it was not a cheap model back then?

I am pretty new to this area of technology and I would have guessed that a huge leap in performance happened since 2013 when the Navibot was initially released but I could not find any reliable information on this. Maybe you guys can help me in finding an answer to this question?

I find the D9 (what is the difference between the D9 Pro and the D9 Max?), the L10, the D10 Plus and the Z10 Pro quite interesting.

In addition, the Xiaomi app appeals to me more than that of Ecovacs, and the Home Assistant integration for Dreame looks better.

"Help re buying new robot vacuumWe had an ecovacs deebot ozmo 950 for last 2.5 yrs which worked relatively well apart from some annoying map mechanics/resetting merging etc.. then all of a sudden one day stopped working - wouldnt leave the dock, saying charging but stuck on 1% despite multiple resets etc..
Luckily we had extended warranty so sent off to get assessed- just heard that we are getting store credit instead (so I am assuming it was not reparable)...

My options are to stick with ecovacs eg OMNI or go with a different brand which I have no experience with. I am a bit hesitant with sticking with ecovacs due to our experience and reading reviews..

We mainly need vacuum function with good suction and mapping functions, mop would be nice but not essential, just needs to be reliable.. our place is single storey with about 90sqm to cover both tiles and carpet in bedrooms, no pets just a toddler who crawls everywhere.

"Lydsto R1 with Autoempty Dock or Roborock S7 without?Hi,

I'd appreciate some advice from owners of either or both of these robot vacuums. I know they're not in the same league, AFAIK roborock is considered more 'top-class', however, I have a budget of about 500 EUR and I can buy either Roborock S7 without Auto Empty Dock, or Lydsto R1 that has AutoEmpty dock included by default (it's cheaper too, around 350 EUR versus 500 for Roborock).

&#x200B;

Some of my friends have Lydsto and they recommend it. However I've read a lot of reviews that say Lydsto's performance is a bit wonky, some people have issues with vacuum losing maps, some people were declined warranty repairs in Xiaomi centers (they were basically told that Lydsto isn't Xiami, despite the box saying it is, so they won't fix it), some got faulty LIdars, etc. Also, my wife doesn't like disposable bags, and Lydsto Dock uses disposable bags, which means buying a new pack every 6 months (what if they cease to be produced?).

I'm not sure Roborock is free from these issues, but being a higher priced unit I tend to think it will be more reliable.

Now... where was I..?

A question therefore is:

Do you think it's better to get a higher priced Roborock and hope it will be more reliable, despite not getting the AutoEmpty Dock; or should I just get a Lydsto, which is cheaper and has an Auto Empty Dock included? Is AutoEmpty Dock a big deal from convenience perspective?

I would greatly appreciate any insights. Thank you."
"Looking for a first robot vacuumLooking into getting my first robot vacuum and not sure what to get. House is all oak hardwood flooring. I do have a pit bull, but it’s good about not having to accidents in the house. I don’t need mopping at all. I like the idea of self emptying, but as I’ve never owned one before idk how “necessary” that is. Not to worried about price, I just want something very reliable that I’m not gonna have to worry about or fuss with. Looked at roborock s4max, s5max, and roomba j7+ So far, but am open to any brand and any model. I’ve seen some negatives on the roomba with charging / battery issues after a month or two and also problems with the side brush motor failing. Those issues do scare me a bit since it costs quite a bit more than the roborocks, but if those issues are rare then I won’t worry about them. If anyone has any other models I should consider I’m all ears."
"robot vacuum recommendationsHello all, fairly new to robot vacuums here, however I do believe I have the basics down. I currently have a lydsto R1 which took a s**t after 45 days, 15 day after the 30 day return window with Amazon.  It refuses to stay docked, it docks itself then leaves and repeats 3 times then says that it can't connect to the dock to charge and to check the connection. I have cleaned the vacuum, reset it, remapped it, updated it, unplugged the dock for 2 hours, etc. Nothing seems to work, and of course the manufacturer is giving me the run around so that's out of the question and the seller is no where to be found. Thankfully, after multiple attempts to speak with Amazon i have been able to get to someone who granted me a full refund for the vacuum. It sucks because it has a lot of cool features; docking station with a dust bin, lidar, moping, 5200mah battery, 2700pa, and for $300! 

With that being said, I will get another vacuum and am willing to pay more for something reliable and of quality with good customer service. 

Must haves are a lidar system or vslam, simply put, something that efficiently mops in good patterns. And something with a dust bin and mops ideally. I'm a single dude, no kids, no pets, living in an apartment with 1 bedroom, mostly hardwood floors except for the bedroom which has carpet. 

I'm torn between roborock s7 maxv ultra or the roomba s9+ but damn that price tag! I could go on a mini vacation for that kind of money! If anyone has a recommendation I'm all ears."
"Roborock S7 or Ecovacs deebot T8+ with pro oscillation mop kitMy house is 2 story house and all in wooden floor, laminate floor and tiles. Mopping is important and thinking to run the robot every 2 days to vacuum and mop the floor.I narrowed down into these 2 models after research within my budget range). Both has pro and cons. Which one is better. Roborock is only $A40 more than deebot as they are in special now.

1. Rocborock S7 (without dock)
2. Ecovacs Deebot T8+ (with auto-empty dust bin and bonus pro oscillation mop kit)

For Deebot T8+'s pro oscillation mop, is that better than S7 's sonic mopping ?

Are both Ecovacs T8 and Roborock S7 reliable and software are easy to use ?

Is T8's object avoidance better than S7 ? Will S7 stuck with the small objects or chairs, ..etc. ?

Which one will you choose for ? Thanks !"

"Any Opinions on iHome Nova vs Ecovacs Deebot N8?I am looking for a budget self-emptying robot vacuum and can't seem to decide between the iHome Nova vs the Ecovacs Deebot N8. On paper, they both seem very similar. I was hoping to get some first hand experiences on reliability and how good the apps are?

The Ecovacs seems to be slightly more expensive but seems to review slightly better, but they both seem to have their own quirks and issues. I am wondering if the price difference is even worth it or if the iHome Nova would be good enough for our purposes.

We have 2 kids (no pets), so the floors get messy from mealtimes and random spills here and there. We have a lot of carpet throughout our house (but have a multi-level home). Both vacs seem to do multi-level mapping, different power levels, no go zones, different mopping levels, etc. 

Thanks!"
"Best robot vacuum and mop with self empty for hardwood floors and pet hairHello Robot Vacuum and Mop Gurus,

I am looking to buy our first robot vacuum and mop for our 2 level approximately 2000 sq foot house- we are looking to move to about a 3000-3300 square foot house(when we are able to find one in this crazy housing market) so would want to get a vac and mop that is able to handle at least that amount of space- mostly hardwood floor and tile in bathrooms and kitchen with some area rugs. We have a 7 month old Labrador retriever puppy so need the vacuum
to be able to clean pet hair. 

I have read ratings and reviews  on several
Websites - tomsguide, pcmag, rtings, wirecutter, realsimple, usatoday, goodhousekeeping, nymag, vacuum wars on youtube, etc. and they all recommend different products with some overlap. I did review a few posts on this and other reddit forums as well but would like to know what the end users like now. I am still very confused and would really appreciate your input based on your personal experiences and knowledge. Is it true that some sites are driven to push certain products more by sponsorships from their manufacturers than by actual product performance?

I went ahead and ordered the roborock s7(for $450 from amazon) the roborock e4( for $220 from amazon) - both without the auto empty bin - and the deebot t8 aivi with the auto empty bin  (for $599 from Costco) so I wouldn’t miss out on the holiday sales- though I am still not sure which one of these would best suit my purpose. I got the e4 based on the review on rtings.com, the t8 aivi based on vacuum wars and pcmag and the s7 based on pcmag’s review - probably listed elsewhere as well. 

Please recommend the best/a fairly good and reliable combined robot vacuum and mop with an auto empty bin that is available in the market today. I am located in the US and am able to return all of the 3 vacuums that I bought if theres a different one that you believe performs better. I am willing to spend upto $600 max  $750 if it really makes sense in terms of what the product delivers as compared to a cheaper one out there. 

Is the technology still evolving or are there products out there which consistently clean well and require minimal maintenance and upkeep? Based on what i have read, I don’t believe  any robot vacuum is able to completely replace a regular corded vacuum entirely but is definitely helpful as a secondary cleaning tool with a regular vac being needed to be used every couple of weeks or so- is that your experience as well?

Thank you so much and have a nice weekend."
"Shark AI IQ LIDAR vs Roomba J7+ vs Ecovacs T8+ AIVII am in the market for a robot vacuum and I am considering these as options but open to other suggestions.


I can get the shark for $320 with auto empty station

The roomba with auto empty is $550 after credit card offer

Ecovacs with auto empty is $600


I have two dogs and one cat so rarely or never any accidents. Maybe twice a year. But object avoidance still sounds great for cords too. The shark has the longest warranty at 5 years. I am unsure how long roombas last or how reliable they are.

Stats:

House size :1500sqft and mix of carpet/hardwood

Pets: 2 dogs and one cat

Budget : probably up to 600, ideally lower. 

Auto empty also is probably a must have feature with all the dog hair. 


Any suggestions?"
"Roomba J7+ vs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVIHi,

I am shopping for my first robot vacuum and have narrowed my choices down to those two. The main reason is that I can get either one at Costco so I would be well covered in case of defects. Price is very similar (100$ difference with auto-emptying base). I looked at Roborock and other brands but they seemed to be harded to come by in Canada...

So, here is what I am looking for in a robot vacuum:

\- 900 sqft house with 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen, 1 living room on the main floor.

\- Every room is separate and the bedrooms are either side of a corridor.- I have 3 dogs and 2 children so logs of dog hairs and some toys on the ground at anytime.

\- All floors are hardwood or ceramic apart from the livingroom which has a carpet in the middle of the room.

\- House mapping and object recognition is important to me. I don't want to babysit the robot and want to be able to have it do the whole house a couple times a week and the kitchen, living room, and corridor, every day without it always getting stuck.

\- Mopping is not a decisive feature for me but nice-to-have.

\- Parts availability: I don't want a paper weight in 6 months if it breaks and I want consumables to be easy to get, either at Costco or on Amazon.

\- Software: A good app that is well maintained. Same for the robot if possible, regular updates to fix issues or provide new features. I don't want to have a device that feels abandoned 6 months in.

From what I understand, both are very good robots. The Roomba seems to have the edge on actual cleaning but may be lacking in terms of mapping as it doesn't sport a LIDAR. Object recognition seems to be really good and the ""POOP"" warranty is interesting. The Deebot seems to have better mapping capabilities but the app seems to be less good. Object recognition also seemed to be a bit less reliable than the Roomba. The mopping attachement is interesting but I am not sure how effective that really is.

So, has anyone on here tried those two and could provide some real world experience? Which one would you suggest I go with?

Thanks!"
"A Critical Review of Popular Vacuum Robot Brands**1. iRobot Roombas**

Roombas are some of the most Reliable overpriced vacuums with a stable and feature-rich app. They don't have LiDARs yet. They don't have the best navigation or object avoidance, and yet they just work.

They are some of the best-rated vacuums out there. That, however, doesn't change the fact that they are highly overpriced for not being even half as smart as most competitors.

**2. Ecovacs Deebots**

Ecovacs has an impressive range of products but only on paper. The buggy room mapping overlaps walls, misinterprets closed doors as walls, forgets room labels every single time. This makes their products totally useless which is really sad as the vacuums by themselves are impressive.

Most issues they have can be fixed with a software update. Sadly, the team hasn't been able to fix any. They'd rather spend their budget on marketing and hiring as many influencers as they can to recommend their products. I'm sure you'll witness that live in the comments section.

**3. 360 Robots**

360 has the best navigation and mapping in the market programmed by a team specialized in building driverless cars. Also, they have the laziest implementation of an Alexa Skill. You can only turn the vacuum on and off using Alexa after which you'll have to open the app anyway.

360 vacuums give you the most value for your money. However, many users have reported that these vacuums need to connect to a server in China. The vacuum is just a piece of plastic if that server is down, which is the case most of the time.

**4. Roborocks**

Roborocks are the only ones on the list that offer convenience by not trading your cleaning problem with a technical one. They are great at mapping rooms, navigating efficiently, and avoiding objects. The app is stable and has all the necessary features. The only downside is the availability of after-sales support based on your country.

**Conclusion:** While we are busy admiring technical specifications, most of us tend to forget that technology is intended to make our lives easier. In the initial phases of anything new, the work reduced is just replaced by the additional effort of dealing with the technical challenges of the product.

So far, the vacuum robot market can be summarized as follows:

**1. Vacuums that have nailed the basics of cleaning but can't deal with tricky situations:** Like the Roombas that might need your help every now and then to move the furniture around

**2. Vacuums that have mastered the tricky situations but can't get the basics right:** Like the Ecovacs with their buggy mapping and app.

**3. Vacuums that have nailed everything but turned their product into total garbage by adding a dependency over a remote server to perform basic cleaning:** Like the 360s

**4. Vacuums that are just perfect with almost everything you need but you can't buy them fearing the lack of after-sales support:** Like the Roborocks"
"Recommendation: S7 vs T9Hi! I know this probably has been asked a lot, but I have finally decided between S7 and T9. I live in a two floor house, mainly with carpet. Only kitchen, entrance hall and dining room with wood floor. I really like the fact that s7 lifts the mop for the carpet, which as I understand the T9 does not do. But the T9 seems better overall for obstacle avoidance and carpet cleaning. I just don’t know which brand might be more reliable, as I tend to see lots of mix reviews in both brands. Specially some issues with the Ecovacs app. 

Any comments or experiences on using these two?

Thanks!"
"Ecovacs DEEBOT OZMO T8+ is on sale at Best Buy in the USA for $449.99 ($300 price reduction)[Here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecovacs-robotics-deebot-t8-vacuum-mop-robot-with-advanced-laser-mapping-and-3d-obstacle-detection-avoidance-grey/6423195.p?skuId=6423195) is the link to the listing on the US site for Best Buy. Regular price is $749.99. It's the T8+ - the + just means it comes with the self-emptying bin. This is **not** the AIVI version with the front camera, but I have seen more favorable reviews for this version, anecdotally.

I have heard this is a common sale, but it may be a couple months before it goes on sale once this offer is over.

The N8+ (not the Pro version) is available for $499.99 from $599.99 at Best Buy as well. However, the N8 Pro+ is available on Amazon for $594.99 from $799.99, if that's to your liking instead. It's to be noted that the [OZMO Pro Mopping](https://www.amazon.com/Ecovacs-Mopping-Scrubbing-Feature-Accessory/dp/B08GH3N618/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=deebot+n8&qid=1627064335&sr=8-10) add-on is only compatible with the T8 and the T8 AIVI

&#x200B;

Overall, I have seen mixed reviews for Ecovacs including some that say the company will offer you a $100 Amazon gift card to remove a negative review, which could mean that the reviews that *are* present artificially skew positive. VacuumWars on YouTube loved the T8 AIVI and the N8 Pro and claims to not be sponsored by Ecovacs and purchased the vacs out of pocket, but some are either suspicious of this claim or outright contend it.

In my limited research, people have a lot of strong feelings about Ecovacs one way or another, and it's hard to verify the integrity of reviews that are openly sponsored, of which there are many. Some are wary of the quality of the devices due to allegedly lower manufacturing standards in China where Ecovacs is based and there are concerns over the longevity of the devices since the company is relatively young. Many complain about the quality and reliability of the app and have issues with the self-emptying bin clogging.

That being said, a lot of this is true or there is some analog for all the robot vacuum companies I have researched recently. Issues with performance, issues with veracity of reviews, lack of features or misalignment between needs of the user and the features offered by the device, quality of manufacturing, and value for money. It seems there is no perfect robot vacuum. Some decry the very notion and suggest you'd do better to get a bagged, corded Miele from 1985 off of eBay and enjoy a feat of German engineering whenever you clean your house.

In the end, I took advantage of this deal today and purchased the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8+ from Best Buy as my first ever robot vacuum. It seems worth at least trying at that price point for what is a competing top-line robovac (by some estimates) with a mopping feature. I also opted to pick up the OZMO Pro Mopping add-on from Amazon. Not on sale, but still come out around the same as I would for the N8 Pro+ at the current sale and it can't handle the mopping upgrade.

I can't speak to anyone else's needs, but me getting a fancy manual vacuum instead of a robot will result in a new stationary friend for my current vacuum that remains so very rarely used. I work from home, have a kid, another on the way, and if this little critter will give me one less thing to worry about, even if it's imperfect, it's worth the risk/investment."
"Looking To Upgrade To A Self-Empty Robot.Looking to upgrade 


So I'm looking to upgrade from my current vacuum helper bot to one with Self-Empty. Preferably with side brushes as my kitten ADORES the current robot. As soon as he hears it activate, he comes running to hunt it and its side brushes.

The reason I want to upgrade is not just convenience (I mean who doesn't want Self-Empty?) but also because my current robot is having issues holding a charge. It will run good for a while and then just die suddenly. It's a knock off with no brand name anywhere and it speaks in broken english but, its surprisingly good at its job and surprised me with what it could pick up. Honestly I love my robot and even gave it googly-eyes.

Anyway, I'm looking for a good and reliable Self-Empty robot. Preferably with side brushes and preferably under 700$. Mop attachment/function not necessary, even though my current one has it. Alot of the ones I looked at had mixed reviews. Any recommendations?

Edit: I forgot to mention that I live in an apartment with 1 bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a small bathroom.

This is what I currently have and it was, surprisingly, very good at its job until recently. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KSWNP4P/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_Q3X0GQYEDC21J205RAV3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
"Looking for a bot to adoptHi everyone,

Been looking before posting and didn't see anything related to this.

We  have a good duo of Roombas at work and they do a great job (vet clinic,  7 women, I let you imagine the amount of hair and dust they have to  deal with). Really pumped up by Bob & Ike (our roombas) and their  performance,  I'm looking forward into buying a vaccum robot friend to  help me keep the house clean.

Only  problem so far : I have a big ass sofa on relatively short feet : 8,5cm  (3,35in). I would have loved to adopt a Roomba, but they are all around  9,5cm (3,74in).  I've seen some models that are ""ultra slim"" with 5,5  to 8cm (2,17 - 3,14 inches), but often some obscure brands on Amazon  (and i'm not so open with the idea of my data being stored in an unknown  company's servers).

They also  tend to all have a wet cleaning feature (which I really don't need imo),  not sure if it's bullshit, if it only takes out dust, or if it really  cleans the floor well. What's your opinion on this ? If it works, any  pet-friendly detergent I can put in it ?

So my dream bot would be :

\- With an app **and secured/trusted servers** / Without an app but with a remote (no random-only mode, I don't want my bot to act like an old blind & deaf Dachshund).- From a trusted/reliable brand- 8cm (3,14in) tall or under (the hardest part)- With central rotative extractor (one or two brushes), as I don't really trust the simple vaccuming hole- Able to handle pet hairs (3 short haired cats)- (Optional)  with two lateral brushes- (Optional) with a square front end for corners

I know I'm asking a lot, but what would you recommend me with those criteria ?

(Done a lot for research too and only found the Deebot Ozmo Slim10 to answer to my wishes but at 850€ it's WAY above my budget)

Thanks to everyone who read this, best wishes to everyone for the upcoming year."

"(Better) alternative to 360 S7pro (Europe)Hello. First of all I apologise if this is not the right place where to ask.

So, I have just returned an S7pro vacuum cleaner by 360smart, a Chinese brand that, to my understanding, is a sort of imitation of the more famous Roborock. The robot was doing fine, but it had several and persistent issues with virtual mapping and it started to wander randomly and stuck sometimes for no clear reason. Also the mopping function was not top notch. Customer service was horrible.

Therefore I would like to buy a replacement which has the same characteristics while being more reliable, most notably the mapping part. I would also appreciate a responsive customer service that doesn't redirect me back and forth from Facebook to some email address. I can buy through Amazon so I should be covered, but having a real customer service would be nice.

Price target is around 350 euro. I live in Europe, if that matters. I was considering the roborock S5 max even though it is 50 euros above my target price ,as it costs 400 euro, but I am not sure whether it is an old model and about the customer service.

I would appreciate any suggestions you may have. Thank you in advance."
"Roborock S5 Max vs Deebot T8 AIVI - what would you buy?I’m buying a new vacuum and I can’t decide! The S5 seems more reliable with a better app etc but mopping is important to me, hence desire for the T8. The more I read Vacuum Wars etc the more confused I get! Please help!"
"Ecovacs deebot N8 VS Roborock S5 max?Hi all

I was after some advice, I've got mainly laminate flooring and some carpet, wanted a robot that can vacuum and mop.

According to the vacuum wars YouTube channel the N8 wins on performance but I've read worrying things about the ecovacs reliability record.

Is there general consensus on here on the best one to go for or any other brands or models to consider?
Want something that just works with minimal fuss and will be reliable.
 I'm in the UK so it's harder to get hold of Roborock but can probably get it on eBay :)

Advice appreciated!"
"New 360 owner to help others.I'm posting this for others as a source of information for this brand/model. I recently purchased the 360 S7 Pro from Amazon. I previously had the Neato D4 which I returned due to its lack of features I was looking for in a robot vac.

As I researched what to buy before and after the D4 I found myself having trouble finding reliable sources of reviews or in the 360's case just reviews. After finding one S7 Pro review on YouTube (that seemed like a non paid spot) and a bunch S9 reviews, I decided to pull the trigger. This was decided mostly based on specs/features to price. At the time of my purchase it was $290 after $100 discount. For that I got all the app features of a modern bot vac, multi floor maps, no go zones for vac and mop, clean rooms in w/e order I want (this was a BIG factor to me), and the vac itself was 2650pa suction.

Performance wise 360 says it's equivalent to the Roborock S5 Max. Idk if that helps you but I never owned a RR, though I read a lot of reviews saying it's carpet performance is ehh. The S7 Pro does quite well on our low pile carpets. Actually it seems to pick up more then the Neato which is surprising since the Neato brush is almost twice as big. I guess that PA does come in handy. It cleans all surfaces very good, though I think I would prefer RR rubber side brush then the bristles. I'm debating a way to use those on the 360. Nothing a dremal couldn't handle.

The navigation has been 100% spot on. Especially compared to the Neato and its lost in a circle actions. If I tell it to do the Living Room at Max power 2x then the playroom at powerful power 2x then the hallway at normal suction 1x it does exactly that avoiding all possible obstacles. At 100% suction power it can clean each room twice before it needs to recharge. When you clean the room twice it will go north /south on the 1st run, then east /west on the 2nd. I find this is probably the most efficient way to clean. Before each pass it cleans the borders. 

The dust bin is avg size, I would prefer a larger bin but at this price range the size seems standard. Both the D4 and S7 Pro get over our kitchen threshold which measures .7in. Though the Neato seemed to have less trouble. Our kids are still young enough where gates are needed, neither vac made it over them. Which still requires me to remove the gate or pick up the vac. Still making the idea of a robot vacuum not fully realized in our household.. 

As of this posting the RR S4Max is down to $320, If I wanted I can return the 360 and buy that. I've decided that I'm looking at a downgrade across the board if I do. I'd only be getting a well known brand over a lesser one.

Both are Chinese made, along with the Deebot and basically every brand on Amazon minus Irobot and Neato (Neato was American but was bought by a German company). I put my faith in the 360 and so far its paid off greatly! 

I will update this post if I see a need.

For reference we have 2 dogs and 2 kids."
"N8+ or S5max? Both on sale for today!N8 plus is 420 at.BB and the s5max is 380 on Amazon.

I want something reliable.

I just returned my brand new ihome autovac nova which I loved but lasted exactly 3 cleanings and 36 hours before something stopped working and now the robot can't even go on a straight line....

I have 1200sqft apartment with 2 bedrooms, 3 carpets, and mostly hardwood. 1 dog. Sand is unlikely to be an issue.

I really like the appeal of a auto empty bin but I'm not sure if it's worth it if the n8 performs a lot worst or is just going to break down."
"Neato Botvac D reviewI’m going to log my review here. I bought the robot in 2016. I used it for 5 years and in 4 different living spaces. I bought it at bed bath and beyond and used the 20% discounts that show up in my mail every month.

Overall: 7.5/10

Pros: intelligence and mapping

This thing was always good about hitting the edges and then coming back to get the interior area. Very satisfying for carpet rooms. 

Cons: reliability, annoying, dirty

Five years is a long time for a robot vacuum so before I highlight it’s weaknesses, it did good. That being said, the robot needed a lot of maintenance. New battery every 6-12 months, side sweeper broke after about 3 months, filters, etc.

Incredibly annoying. Will never stop beeping if it has an issue. 

Emptying the box is a pretty dirty process.


I just bought a Roomba e3 and it’s much faster and quieter and tries harder to get out of sticky situations. It doesn’t have the smart mapping set up yet but the emptying process is also much cleaner. Time will tell."
"Deebot Ozmo T8+ Quick ReviewHonestly, I bought it expecting the issues others were having. I got mine from bestbuy for $450

It mapped my entire two story home without an issue, and was able to be brought up and down stairs and find it's location without a problem.

Battery life on Max+ is only about 70min but I think that's on par or better than other brands. 

Cleaned all the stuff on my tile without slinging it, and the carpet (upstairs) had a bin full of dirt when I had vacuumed 3 days prior which makes me think it works well.

Long term reliability is unknown, haven't tried mopping but I barely have tile so it's not a huge concern. 

Much quieter than expected but still a bit loud if you're trying to watch TV.

Lidar works great and navigated every room with ease."
"Could someone recommend me a robot vacuum?Hi, I'm looking for a relatively cheap robot vacuum I could use in my house. Here's a few things about my house:

**Home** \- around 100 m2 (6 rooms)

**Flooring** \- Mostly carpets ranging from 2mm to 10mm. The kitchen has tiles and the bathroom has PVC flooring. The issue is: I have doorsteps ranging up to 25mm in some places (on the carpet close to the doorstep it's around 20mm).

**Cleaning requirements** \- A lot of hair (I have a long-haired dog), some food particles and crumbs (also dry dog food), tobacco, sometimes some sawdust and dirt.

What I'm looking for:

1. Obviously the basic stuff: powerful robot, fairly big dust bin, also it needs to be reliable.
2. A fairly cheap robot (up to $283, maybe even $300).
3. My furniture can fit a robot no bigger than 10,5 cm (about 11 cm between the furniture and the floor), so it cannot exceed that limit.

So I was considering these three robots:

\- **iRobot Roomba 697** (I've heard very good things about Roombas, but the random vacuuming pattern might be an issue),

\- **Neato D4 Connected** (it has a big brush which would be great for carpets, my doorsteps might cause a problem though; apparently only 15mm is recommended for Botvacs, can Botvacs climb onto higher obstacles than 15mm?),

\- **Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum Pro** (it's a little too expensive, the dustbin is the smallest out of these 3 \[0,5l\], but my home is already full of Xiaomi products).

Right now I'm thinking about getting the Neato Botvac D4 Connected (because of the big brush, LIDAR and big dustbin), but I've read mixed reviews about it. The iRobot Roomba 697 most likely wouldn't be as good in cleaning the carpet as the Neato and I've also read mixed reviews about it, but it's the cheapest.

Maybe there are some other robots that I didn't consider?

Btw: Are used robot vacuums worth it? Maybe I could buy a used one and save some money?

What do you think?"
"S9+ Alternatives?Recently purchased an S9+, my first robo vacuum. When it works, it’s great. Really like the self emptying bin and cleaning power. 

The issue is that I’m constantly getting Error 31. Given the prevalence of the error, I’m not sure that a new replacement will perform much better. 

Are there any good alternatives at the “premium” level? Ideally would have self emptying capability, strong cleaning and navigational features (have a pet that sheds), and is reliable. 

Some of the new 2021 CES models look promising but are also untested and I’m not sure when they’re coming out. 

Any good alternatives?"
"Deebot OZMO 920 ReviewDeebot OZMO 920 Review

 The app is dreadful and verges on the unusable.

""Divide a room"" does not work - It is pretty much impossible to divide an area.  This is a problem if you have areas split by glass for example or a conservatory whereby the Deepbot can 'see' outside and thinks it is the same room.

The clicking on a point in the divide room app doesn't work a lot of the time, even when using a touch pen and not my fingers.

Really the vacuum itself is fine, good even! but the software is miserable.

Also the Bot - we named ours 'Dorris' loses its base station and has to be recovered. Makes it impossible to use unattended.  Like most 'bots' it eats any phone charger cable it finds - like by the side of your bed.

The bot also fell off a step edge so the step awareness is not working reliably. This would be less of a problem if I could divide an area - see my first point.

I would avoid this device and I think I will send mine back to Amazon"
"Should I buy the Roomba s9+, Roomba i7+, or the Roborock S6? Extensive details below about the house, its occupants, and why I'm considering each.I've spent a couple of days researching the difference between all the Robot Vacuums (with a lot of help from this sub and r/roomba) and now I need some help narrowing it down between these 3. I'm mainly looking at the i7+ and the s9+. The Roborock S6 caught my eye because of the price, and multi-floor mapping (the mop functionality is a nice bonus, but not a selling point). The current prices on Amazon are as follows s9+=$900, i7+=$600, Roborock S6=$420 (after a coupon)

The main floor is about \~4000 sq feet and is tile and hardwood with some rugs in the living room and a couple of mats in front of the doors, so the majority of the main floor is still tile and hardwood. Only 3 people live in the house (my parents and myself) and there aren't any kids or animals so major messes and things like toys or problem objects aren't a concern. The only person with long hair is my mom (she does leave some hair on the ground in my parent's bathroom, but not enough that it's a concern). My dad and I both have facial hair and trim our beards regularly so there are some little hairs on the bathroom floor, but most of it ends up in the sink. The only other point of concern is the stools in the kitchen, they have kind of a lower base so the Shark IQ I have right now keeps trying to climb and vacuum them which ends up scoffing them. I run into a similar issue with some of the swivel chairs in the living room too.

The features I really like are the self-empty and the charge and resume function which both the i7+ and the s9+ have (not sure about the Roborock S6). I was curious about the no-go zones in regards to how precise they are, how small of an area they can cover (can they focus on small areas like a stool/chair with a wide-ish base that might be climbed?), and how effective are they? 

I'm leaning towards getting the i7+ because it seems comparable to the s9+ but it's also $300 cheaper than the s9+ and there isn't much carpet so the x4 suction power doesn't seem that enticing to me, I could live without the D-shaped design too (but it does seem cool ngl). The Roborock caught my eye because it's much cheaper and seems to have similar features to the Roombas. It also has a mop AND multi-floor mapping (which correct me if I'm wrong, but the i7+ or s9+ don't have multi-floor mapping). It would be nice to be able to use the i7+ or the s9+ in the basement too (which is also hardwood and tile with the exception of an area rug in the living room) But if it can't be down it's not a deal-breaker since the main floor is the focus.

Price is a factor, but I would much rather spend more and get one that is reliable, will last a long time, and is efficient/effective. I tried to give as much detail as possible about the house and the people living in it if you need more feel free to ask. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated and thank you guys in advance!"
"Need to replace Neato D3. Another Neato?Hey folks!

I bought a Neato Botvac D3 in 2018. In 2019, the Lidar sensor failed. Then again in 2020 and although it was just out of warranty, they covered it; but also made it clear that they weren’t going to cover anything again. 

Now in 2021, you guessed it...

All of the reviews point to the Neato D7 as being the best value in that $500 price range that I’d like to stick at. Does anyone know if the reliability issues are similar? Searching around online, it seems like a 6-12 month lifespan for that lidar sensor is in fact not at all unusual. Other than the reliability, I’ve really liked the Neato so I’d be happy to have another one; but I’m definitely concerned that it might be another repeated failure...

Thanks!"
"Does anyone have experience with Proscenic M6 PRO?Now I am torn between Proscenic M6 PRO and Roborock S5 Max. It seems that S5 Max is better overall, but I am very tempted by the low price tag of M6, which will save about 200 USD. 

M6 Pro has so many positive reviews on Amazon, but I am not too sure if they are reliable or just paid reviews given how Chinese company runs their business on Amazon these days.

Does anyone have experience with Proscenic M6 PRO? I wonder how they work in reality in comparison to S5 Max."
"Best Vac for AirBnB Host?My use case:

800sqf, all hardwood floors, one rug which I would no-zone.  
No pets but the place gets very dusty.

Mopping isn't super important to me (a nice to have) because my cleaners mop between guests. Ultimately I want something reliable that I can run remotely, with good mapping, won't get stuck and will be ACCURATE. Ideally a large bin and/or auto dump dock since I won't always be there to empty and clean it. Siri would also be a plus.  


Thoughts?"
"Smart Navigation VacuumAsking for recommendations for a smart navigation robot vacuum. Had a black and decker random navigation vacuum. Bought my mother the Roomba E5. They just move around like an old blind dog, not cleaning that great. I'm not fimilar with all the brands available. Would like a nice reliable vacuum and not just the next big expensive trend/craze. Have a 2 story house, 1250 sqft per floor. Upstairs is all carpet and downstairs is hard floors. Dont really care about the area blocks and mapping/reports, just whole area cleaning. Have looked at Roomba 960 and I7 but just not sure which way to go. Thanks for any input."

"360 S10 vs Roborock S6 MaxvGreetings All,

Our home pretty much has toys and lego blocks scatter on the floor as we have got young children.

I have been eyeing on the Roborock S6 MaxV since its release last year due to its AI computer vision capability.

I done extensive research on it and it seems that the MaxV not only has blind spots, its computer vision navigation capability isn't that reliable.

The new 360 S10 uses 3 LIDARs. 1 x front mounted long range for general navigation, 1 x front mounted short range to detect objects as small as 1cm, and a side mounted Lidar to reduce blind spots.

Would you go for the S10 or MaxV?

TIA!"
"Advice neededI'm looking to buy a replacement for my Roomba 690. It is between the Shark IQ with base, the Roomba i7 with base, 9r the roborock s5 without base. 

We have all tile, 1500sqft, one floor, two dogs, three women with longish hair. The 690 works well but is loud, imprecise, runs forever, can't find the base, typical 600 series stuff. It gets a bin full of dog hair and dirt every day. 

I really want the auto empty base, no go lines, and reliability. I guess I'm looking at the i7 but is there anything compelling me to the other two?"
"Mijia 1C vs Dreame F9? need urgent helpHi

I have bought the Mijia 1C. It will be delivered this next Monday, I still don't have it on my hands. 

After further investigation I have found that there is a robot that is almost the same, but it has much better battery life (5200mah rathenmr than the 2400 on 1C) and smarter maps / app.

I feel so sad that only now I have discovered that the Dreame F9 has room partition, room cleaning, scheduled room cleaning, etc. I mean, it has much better features than the 1C, but exactly with the same chassis / hardware. :(

My questions are the following :

1) Shall i send back the Mijia 1C (I will not even accept it to be delivered this Monday) and buy the Dreame F9 ?? 



2) Since the hardware it's the same, do you think that sooner than later xiaomi will update the firmware / app for the 1C to get room partitions too? do you know if there is any upcoming firmware update that will put both robots at the same smart map level? 



3) Do you think there will be any substancial differences in reliability / hardware malfunction between these two? both are manufactured by roborock and both are xiaomi brand.. btt don't know, since dreame is a much less known sub-brand. 

All the help and guidance is appreciated.
please tell me your upmost honest opinions on this. I need to make a decision till this next Monday.

Thank you all in advance. I'm really needing real professional advise. ."

"Are Neatos shite or did we get an outlier?We bought a Neato Botvac D80 two years ago and since then we have had to replace the battery twice and now it’s down with a broken laser turret. We are deciding whether to sink more money into it by fixing it or just buy another brand. Our floors are about 2000 sq. ft, 60% hardwood and tile, 30% short carpet and two small shag-like rugs. We typically run the vacuum 3-5 days a week. I would be surprised if our reliability issues were from overuse. 

Should we put more money in this vacuum, buy a different Neato or buy a different brand?"
"SharkClean Scheduler just doesn’t work.I have the Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 with the self emptying base. Had to fight with the app to even connect it to the robot vacuum but the schedule mode doesn’t seem to work at all. I have it set to run M,W, and F at 8:00 PM, and it will just never run. When I first got it setup on Tuesday, it ran automatically at 8 PM that night, but nothing since. I have read on here that people have had issues with it running a few hours different from what it was set at, so I thought maybe mine was just 24 hours off and would’ve ran at least another time since Tuesday and I could predict how it was skewed but nope. Anybody have any advice on getting it to work? (Besides buying something else 🤣)
TIA"
"Cheapest Quiet Robot?My roomba is no longer useable. I need a new vacuum robot. I have 3 deal breakers. I'm looking for the cheapest.

* No touch bumper. 
* Moves in predictable pattern, not random.
* Quiet. Preferably no vacuum and just a sweeping robot (not a mopping robot, too much maintenance.)"
"Roborock availibilty NADoes anyone know what's up with the North America avilibility of the roborocks?

Neither here in Canada nor in the US they seem to be available right now. Not even aliexpress and co. deliver to Canada at the moment for some reason.

Any thoughts/experiences/predictions on that?"
"This is a serious question -- Is there a Robovac that doesn't suck? As in, it works consistently.I'm a believer in Robovacs and I desperately want to find one that works. But I have had terrible luck so far. 

First I had a Neato D7. It was awful. It constantly had issues with mapping, had a sensor malfunction, and it never ended up working as I wanted it to. I ended up getting it repaired under warranty, and it had issues again with mapping and just randomly stopping during jobs and saying it was done or saying sensors were dirty or something. Then Neato made a new app that only supported the latest devices and abandoned the old one. I eventually just stopped using it because the issues were not worth the time. 

So, I replaced it with an ECOVACS N8+ last year. It has a pretty good app (way better than the Neato app) and physically the device felt like it was built better. Well, the auto-empty bin flat out doesn't work because of a design flaw (this is well documented). Not a big deal because I probably wouldn't have used it as I don't want to buy proprietary bags. But what is a big deal, is that the vacuum just doesn't really work. It constantly has issues following the map and always needs to re-map the house. It stops in the middle of jobs for no reason or again, has issues with sensors. 

So......the point of this post is this: Is there a high-quality robovac that will just work consistently without me haven't to constantly reset it, re-map, and just overall spend time getting the thing to work? I don't trust reviewers anymore because the 2 robovacs I have bought are highly rated so I'm looking for opinions from non-reviewers."
"Any suggestions? The best one for tile to carpet transition (low pile)Hi there! I am using the Roborock S5 max and I love it. However, my baby is getting old so it's time to retire her :( We have 2 dogs that shed quite a lot so we run it everyday. 

What we need are:

1. I don't necessary need to mob the floor cause I do it by myself.
2. I'm not opposed to dust self cleaning though. It's not a deal breaker and I can do it myself as well.
3. The floor we use it regularly is about 1200 sq st.
4. It consists of hardwood and low pile carpet. I am looking for anything that would make a smooth transition between 2 different flooring. My old lady Roborock is so LOUD when she drop her body from carpet to hardwood and she bulldozer forward without a blink!
5. Of course I would need precise mapping cause I love that features, all that no-go zones stuff is AMAZING.

open to the discussion! And thank you so much for your tips!"
shark ai self empty not cleaning whole houseso my shark will clean most of the 850 sqft mainfloor but will consistantly miss about 2 rooms. The map looks good. This is just pushing clean in the app. I am new to shark robots so any help would be great.
"Shark AI self empty XL mapping/location issue. Model RV2520A0US.Just purchased this a few weeks ago, and no matter how many times I've tried re-mapping, it always seems to get the location wrong. Ex. I tell it to go to the laundry room, and it goes to my bedroom. I tell it to go to the kitchen, and it goes to the living room. And it's the same consistent error every time, ie laundry room only redirects to my bedroom and nowhere else, kitchen only redirects to living room, and nowhere else. It's a similar issue with spot cleaning. I tell it to spot clean a spot near its home base, and it goes to totally different corner of the apartment. It makes me think there's a bug with the way it's registering it's home base or something since it's a pretty consistent error, and the location is relative to the home base.

Again, I've tried re-mapping, deleting rooms, and restarting the app and the robot itself, but the exact same issue persists every time. I briefly spoke with a customer service rep who informed me that my firmware is already uptodate, so that's not the issue. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get more help from them since I've been busy during their business hours.

Just wondering if others have experienced this issue, and/or how I should go about troubleshooting? Or if I should just have the unit replaced?"
"Possible dumb question, regarding cleaning fluidHi, all. I have a [Bissell Spinwave vacuum/mop robot.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F6Z89LN?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_ypp_rep_k0_1_10&amp&crid=GYXQ9W2BBP0X&amp&sprefix=bissell+sp) The link is to the exact one. My question is about the cleaning fluid. I know it specifically says the whole ""for best results use only Bissell"" such and such. My question is...I just found a case of [this rug and carpet shampoo](https://www.theaerusstore.com/products/turbo-carpet-shampoo-4-liters) at work that's going to get thrown out (since no one knows where it came from, and we're a heavy truck shop, not an appliance supply store), and I was wondering if anyone knows if this would work in the mop tank on this. It looks like it's roughly the same consistency, clarity, etc. It's even fragranced, like the Bissell fluid.   


Thanks for any help anyone can give!"
"Warning - Beware of Roborock Vacuums - Horrible Customer ServiceI bought a Roborock S7 last November after reading numerous online reviews describing it as the best vacuum/mop combo.  Over the last few months, the vacuum bin has consistently clogged with dog hair, to the point where it leaves clumps of dog hair and dust all over my house.  I have replaced almost all components that are able to be replaced (brush, filter, etc.) and it has not fixed the issue.

After all of this, I reached out to Roborock customer service to make a warranty claim.  They instructed me to run a number of ""tests"" with the vacuum (understandable), which I did run.  The test (picking up Cheerios) was run successfully (the Cheerios were picked up), but it still did not solve my problem with pet hair and dust not making their way into the bin.

Roborock customer service told me that the vacuum was operating correctly and that there was nothing they could do.  To make this more frustrating, their e-mail server will not allow me to respond directly to their e-mails - it cites a technical error and when I click for more information it brings me to a Google page that is all in Chinese.  I called their U.S. phone number and spoke to a nice person who essentially told me there was nothing he could do over the phone - and that all requests had to be made by e-mail to their overseas customer support.

I am highly suspicious that many of the online Roborock reviews are either: (1) bought and paid for by the company; or (2) made by fake accounts.  I post this as a warning to others - the vacuum may work great for a while, but if you ever need any customer service related to a broken part, etc., expect many roadblocks and very little help."
"Best robot vacuum and mop with self empty for hardwood floors and pet hairHello Robot Vacuum and Mop Gurus,

I am looking to buy our first robot vacuum and mop for our 2 level approximately 2000 sq foot house- we are looking to move to about a 3000-3300 square foot house(when we are able to find one in this crazy housing market) so would want to get a vac and mop that is able to handle at least that amount of space- mostly hardwood floor and tile in bathrooms and kitchen with some area rugs. We have a 7 month old Labrador retriever puppy so need the vacuum
to be able to clean pet hair. 

I have read ratings and reviews  on several
Websites - tomsguide, pcmag, rtings, wirecutter, realsimple, usatoday, goodhousekeeping, nymag, vacuum wars on youtube, etc. and they all recommend different products with some overlap. I did review a few posts on this and other reddit forums as well but would like to know what the end users like now. I am still very confused and would really appreciate your input based on your personal experiences and knowledge. Is it true that some sites are driven to push certain products more by sponsorships from their manufacturers than by actual product performance?

I went ahead and ordered the roborock s7(for $450 from amazon) the roborock e4( for $220 from amazon) - both without the auto empty bin - and the deebot t8 aivi with the auto empty bin  (for $599 from Costco) so I wouldn’t miss out on the holiday sales- though I am still not sure which one of these would best suit my purpose. I got the e4 based on the review on rtings.com, the t8 aivi based on vacuum wars and pcmag and the s7 based on pcmag’s review - probably listed elsewhere as well. 

Please recommend the best/a fairly good and reliable combined robot vacuum and mop with an auto empty bin that is available in the market today. I am located in the US and am able to return all of the 3 vacuums that I bought if theres a different one that you believe performs better. I am willing to spend upto $600 max  $750 if it really makes sense in terms of what the product delivers as compared to a cheaper one out there. 

Is the technology still evolving or are there products out there which consistently clean well and require minimal maintenance and upkeep? Based on what i have read, I don’t believe  any robot vacuum is able to completely replace a regular corded vacuum entirely but is definitely helpful as a secondary cleaning tool with a regular vac being needed to be used every couple of weeks or so- is that your experience as well?

Thank you so much and have a nice weekend."
"Fixing the T8 on simultaneous dual band networksI have a T8 AIVI with dock.  It doesn’t work consistently on simultaneous dual band networks.  I have a newer Xfinity gateway with tons of WiFi stuff on it and need an extender pod to cover the house.  

Unfortunately, Xfijity doesn’t allow dedicated 2.4ghtz and 5ghtz if you use their pods.  The T8 keeps dropping from the dual band network.  So I can’t ‘unblend’ the 2 wave bands and the Deebot can’t stay connected to them.  Happens every 2-3 weeks.  😡

In order to get back on the network, I have to reinstall the T8 and remap the house.  Argh!!!  Deebot customer service offered no solutions other than reinstalling.  $&@!

Anyone else face this and have a fix for the issue?

I can live with the crappy dust bin emptying on the dock (barely).  But the dropping from the network is driving me nuts!"
"Having trouble finding a quiet, “taller”, <$300 option.I love my Eufy11s but its “feature” of being ultra slim is actually a negative in my upstairs, where it constantly gets trapped under my furniture and cabinetry. I can’t keep stuffing random things under my furniture as makeshift barriers; it’s unsightly and a hassle. I tried the bObsweep pet hair plus purely because it’s too tall to get wedged under my furniture; while that factor worked well, I took it back because the thing is so loud I could hear it from outside, not to mention the fact that it’s an absolute moron when faced with rugs, stairs, and getting itself home. 

I have spent hours researching decibel levels of other models, but am having a hard time getting consistent answers. I’ll see one site say a robot is 58db, while another states the same model is 65-70. (Supposedly Eufy is 55, which is just  right for me.) Several options I found seem to be discontinued models. Is it possible to find a quiet-as-a-Eufy machine in a NON-slim design on my budget of <$300? The Eufy was $150 and is a dream, save for getting stuck all of the time."
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Shark RV1001 charging base on carpetI've got a couple Shark RV1001 vacuums on separate floors in the house. They work ok, but have a consistant problem between the two. Both push the charging base from the side while cleaning, sometimes leaving it at an angle to the wall. I'm thinking about 3d printing some small spikes to stick to the bottom with double sided tape or an entire base plate, like what comes with the AE models. Anybody else come up with a solution to hooks the charging base in place on carpet?"
"Roborock S6 vs Tesvor S6?I just picked up my first robot vacuum- a Tesvor S6 for $210. The price seemed too good to pass up. It’s mostly great except the app integration through “WeBack” is an absolute dumpster fire. Massive delays on map updates, map corruption, maps disappearing, etc.

Also, when the robot gets stuck, if I reposition it even a little bit the robot tends to overlay a rotated map image over the original map and REALLY get disoriented. 

Finally, the robot only speaks 2.4GHz wifi and doesn’t play nice with NetGear Smart Connect, during setup which uses a single SSID for both frequencies . It’s possible that some of my app problems are coming from this issue. 

The price was great but given the wifi and software issues I’m not sure the value is there.

The Roborock S6 seems virtually identical, to the point where they seem like the same chassis and hardware except for the battery. It seems like it could be a possible upgrade path but if I switched I’d wonder if I would be paying more than double for the privilege of having the same problems. Does anyone have relevant experience? Does the Roborock support 5GHz wifi? How good is the app integration (map quality/consistency/latency) How good is the robot at reorienting itself if I need to move it?"
"Roborock S50 Max vs Deebot Ozmo 950 vs 360 s7Hi guys,

"Consumer Reports Jan 2018 ratings on robotic vacuums in Samsungs site. Link. And my thoughts on our 9350.We got a 9350 model. Refurb from Amazon with extended warranty. Jurys still out though with frequent CO2 error code yet nothing found in LH drive wheel. May get punted back to the seller within the 90 day thingy here pretty quick. Honestly. To me. This technology is like plastic surgery and they haven't quite worked all the bugs out of all of em to sell em n make people happy consistently. It may be just the fact I have a refurb as well. Other than that this thing vacuums as good as or better than a good stand up model. Thats a Hoover 2 pc set from Sears 10 years old. Big problems getting the mapping set as well. Seems to get hung up in places at times. About 50% of the time.
Ehh. We'll see. Hopefully this link helps people decide. I chose the higher end which was lower on the scale but does have good suction power. CR also considers cost as a ratings adjuster.

"Which robots have dirt sensing capability?I swear that I saw videos of some robots noticing that there was dirt and they needed to go over the same area again to get the dirt. Now I cannot figure out which ones do this... or did I just imagine that this was a feature?

Thanks for any guidance!

&#x200B;

Oh, and which ones know that they are full and need to be emptied? "
"Which robot vacuum is best for me?Hi there. I’ve decided to make the jump to a robot vacuum due to all the praise they seem to get. My question is which one is right for me?

The house is completely laminate/tile, no carpet at all. The things I’m looking for most is picking up dirt and dog hair, as well as mopping capabilities. I don’t really need the self depositing aspect, as I don’t think it’s worth the extra money for me. Ideally, I would like to stay under $600. I have my eye on the Roborock S6, but was looking to get more opinions. Thanks!"
"Sanity check on Roborock S7 Pro Ultra (UK)I've currently got a Xiaomi Mi robot vacuum. It has served me well but it is getting very long in the tooth.

In my searching of.options I came across the Roborock S7 Pro Ultra on offer for £960. It's considerably more than I was planning on spending, but also considerably more capable.

Would those here, with more experience, consider that a good option and price? Or are there better options out there, that I missed?"
"Advice - Hardwood floor, 2 cats, 1300ft open condoI've had less than stellar experiences with Robovacs through the years (a first gen Neato that did ok but got lost often) and an iLife that was inexpensive but also could never be left unattended.  I'd be willing to spend more this time if it means less hassle and better tech.

As the title says, no carpets and mainly hair/dust on hard floors. While open area there is plenty of furniture and obstacles and as such I'd prefer a good navigation system. If truly capable of doing its thing unattended, a self cleaning/emptying station would be a nice feature.

Mopping wise, again, if it's not just a gimmick but a functional feature, that would be appreciated.

No need for world breaking suction or best battery life due to limited space and floor type. A brush system that wouldn't get caught in cat hair would be a major plus (seems like the cheaper low end do this better!).

Shopping in Canada, looking at ideally a sub 500$ budget but some flexibility if truly worth it.

Thanks! :)

Edit - Went for the D10 Plus on sale at 480$ Cad, hopefully a good buy"
"Shark vacuum won't go to roomsThis is all of a sudden. It's worked great since we bought it, but now when I tell it to go to a specific room, it undocks, moves about a foot away from the dock, spins, makes it's little ""I'm done, going to dock"" sound, and then docks.

"Roborock S8 Pro Ultra worth upgrade?Hey there!

My appartment has two problems the Deebot T9 Aivi isn't solving. First I have a large, black rug. Some iRobots seem to have dual Sensors so they don't think black underground is a cliff - does the new Roborock have a similar feature or is it cleaning dark undergrounds without having to cover the cliff sensors? Second I have a long haired Dog (and girlfriend). I switched from the Roborock S5 to the T9 Aivi because I had to remove big strains of tangled hairs from the brush each day. Now the Deebot needs me to do this once a week or less but the self cleaning base has problems sucking the dirt through the dust bin openings because the long pet hair jams them (especially if either the dust bin is almost full or the bag in the base is more than half full.. I hope the dual brush feature of the Roborock has the same low maintenance but how does the base compare to the Deebot or iRobots when a mess of long hair and other dirt is in the robot vaccum? Is the new S8 line capable of solving my problems or should I wait or try an iRobot?"

"HEPA filter, lidar mapping, self emptyingI've had 2 robot vacuums and LOVE not having to vacuum regularly, but both were sub-par (first had no mapping, current one has mapping but crappy software that erases the map whenever the battery dies or it gets stuck) and I'm ready to make a bigger investment in a higher quality robot vacuum. Budget is around $300-500, but I could go higher if its really worth it. 

We have 1 very hair dog and 1 cat, hardwood floors, and around 1,600 square ft house. I have allergies and my allergist told me to only buy vacuums with HEPA filtration, so thats a must. It also has to have good smart mapping with no go zones and lidar since we run the vacuum at night. Finally, I want it to be self emptying. Self cleaning brushes, etc would be a nice plus but isn't required. I have no interest in mopping capability. 

Any recommendations?"

"Yeedi Vac Pro 2I need a good vacuum and mop robot with good obstacle avoidance, vacuum and mop capability, The two choices I see that seem to be a good fit for me are the Yeedi Vac Pro 2 and the Roborock R7 MaxV.  The Max V, however would strain my budget. Doable, but barely. Not getting the Plus or Ultra due to cost. 


Anyone have the Yeedi Vac  Pro 2? If so, what do you like or dislike about it. Anyone return a Yeedi Vac Pro 2 for a Roborock model? If so, was the switch a huge upgrade?

Not seeing a lot of reviews in here are elsewhere about the Yeedi brand vs Roborock. What I see negative about the Yeedi seems to be in regards to its mapping ability. Curious to see opinions of current/ past users of Yeedi vacs."
"Looking for a Robot-vacuum/mop that does not mop on the carpetsI am looking for a robot vacuum cleaner that has also the mop function included and it's capable of recognizing carpets and not to mop on them. I am buying it to avoid cleaning every week, so I am looking for something with a very good cleaning performance. As a budget I would prefer to spend not more than 500 Euros. if it's cheaper, even better. I live in Germany."
"Robot vacuum that can handle 5 dogs, 70+ plants in a single story houseHello!

EDIT: I Ultimately went with the shark AI with XL self-empty dust bin... and LOVE IT! I've only had it a few weeks, but 0 complaints so far.


As the title states, my home now holds 5 dogs (2 labs, 1 colli, 1 terrier, 1 mini schnauzer),  2 adults and an unreasonable amount of indoor plants. We understand this is a LOT for our space, and are actively looking for a larger home. The dogs each get hours of attention and playtime every day so please do not worry! 

My little roomba 960 I bought in 2016 just can't keep up anymore, so I'm looking for an upgrade. 

My house contains 3 carpeted rooms, a few low pile rugs, and laminate flooring in a single story. ~1900sqft

My requirements are: self emptying base, can move around objects (dog toys, plants, dog beds, etc), room-by-room mapping and scheduled cleaning, can handle light potting soil spills, dog hair, low pile carpet/rugs and laminate wood flooring. Preferably the new vacuum is quiet as we both work from home every day.

We have little to no interest in mopping capability and would prefer to stay under ~$800 but are flexible.

Please let me know what you recommend!"
"Narwal Freo or T10? Looking for a TRUE mopping robotFor a vacuuming robot, I have a Neato and it does a somewhat decent job until it lasts (Neato robots, in my experience, have a 15-month planned obsolescence date. I have to purchase a new vacuum every 15 months). I am looking for a mopping robot that TRULY mops the floors. I do not have a carpet. I just have hardwood floors and ceramic in my three bathrooms. My question is if you think I should still buy the Freo or if I can purchase the T10. What are the main benefits of the Freo over the T10 considering that I will only use this robot for its mopping capabilities? 

For those who have tried both, which one is better? And, do these robots truly mop the floors of the entire house? I am asking these questions because I have been very disappointed with the other mopping robots"
"Upgrade fail from Eufy 11s to G30. Switch to Roomba?I had an Eufy 11s for years that I was very pleased with. I had to replace it’s components (including battery) several times but it wasn’t a big deal because it was easy and parts readily available. It would start, run without complaint, and do a pretty good job. Every couple of months it would fail to make it to the base station, but no big deal. 

I upgraded to a G30 Edge because I liked the 11s so much. I have been less than impressed so far. The app is lackluster (and it doesn’t have a remote for basic use), it fails to get to the base station 50% of the time, I think the random cleaning of the 11s did a better job because the mapping sucks and the vacuum doesn’t recharge and continue as expected, its constantly complaining that I need to clean its sensors (which I then do), and my long hair tangles it weekly minimum. Stark difference in satisfaction between the two models. 

My question is do I stick with Eufy and go for an X8 or jump ship to Roomba? If so, which model?

1000 square feet of hardwood, a couple low rugs, house is kept very tidy and was previously robo-vacuum proofed by securing all cords etc. No pets, two clean adults, one with long hair. If it matters, any kind of Alexa type stuff is wasted on me. I use homekit (but not siri) for home automation. I’m capable of adding products via Home Assistant or Homebridge if supported. I’d be more than happy with a remote that has a start button though."
"Budget recommendations for hardwood floors? +/- 250-300 euros? (EU)Hi guys,

I'm in the market for my first robot vacuum but I need some help because there are so many similar models. Roborocks seem to be the best, but they are a bit above my budget.

My requirements are quite simple: I just want it to vacuum the hardwood floors of my apartment, mopping would be nice too. I would also like it to have some mapping capabilities so it vacuums more efficiently and doesn't bump into things constantly  (lidar?).

So far I've found these:

* Xiaomi Dreame Bot D9 Pro (€259)
* Xiaomi Dreame Bot D9 Max (€269)
* Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop 2 Pro (€305)
* Ecovacs Deebot N8 (€209)

I've heard some horror stories about the Ecovacs software so that might not be the best option. What would you guys recommend, any other recommendations??"
"Suggestions on models for house with pet hair?We have 2 dogs, both long hair and shedding. We also have 2 cats. We are looking for our first robot vaccum to help cut down on the dog hair floating around. This would be for the main floor only, with a mix of hardwood, medium pile carpet, low pile carpet and a few rugs. 

I'd like to find something with the following specs:

2000pa or higher
LIDAR
Google Home integration with scheduling
Self emptying
$300usd or less

Things I definitely do not want:

Mop capabilities
General wear parts that are not user replaceable

I've found the Eufy G40+ which fits most of these with the exception of LIDAR. Also looking at a Shark AV2511AE. Is there anything I'm missing?"
"Robot Vacuum Recommendation...Recently bought Wyze (returned because battery was weak and it was constantly getting stuck.  Only cleaned 700 ft before returning to base).  Then bought Ihome Nova IVHR6 and love it (good Lidar and doesn't hit furniture) but just learned that it has a max mapping capability of 2150 SF.  Can't run whole house on one map so have to manually split the house.  That is a deal breaker.

Requirements:

Hardwood Floors 90% + Tile Floors 10%

No Mopping

Must have 2600-2800 SF capability as the house is one story without steps.

Must have the autoclean/dust bin.

Strong battery.

Navigate runners/area rugs (not too thick)

Have 1 dog so some pet hair (nothing crazy).

Suggestions?

Thanks in advance."
Thinking about buying the EcoVacs T8+I'm looking for a decent overall robot vacuum with self cleaning and mopping. I did some research watching Vacuum Wars on YT and found that it checks all the boxes around my budget. I also found that it has some mapping problems for people on here but it could be the loud minority. Its on sale for 530$ at BestBuy which is a plus because I have a CC with them. [Link Here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecovacs-robotics-deebot-t8-vacuum-mop-robot-with-advanced-laser-mapping-and-3d-obstacle-detection-avoidance-grey/6423195.p?skuId=6423195) What do you guys think of the T8+ and if you have any other recommendations let me know!

"What vacuum should I get?About 1200 sq. ft., 1/2 hardwood and 1/2 rugs with medium-high loop pile, two kids under 5, two dogs that shed. I'm looking at the Roborock s6 as it's on the best of the premiums list and is currently $311 on Amazon. I currently have a D7 and have been unable to solve a brush drive gear issue but otherwise think it does a pretty darn good job. My budget is about $600 but if there is something that is miles better than anything else and it's $700, I'd get it.  
Also, I am clueless on how the pad on the bottom works (of the S6). Is it wet? Do you replace them weekly? Does it just get disgusting when it goes over carpet/rugs? I've only ever had a eufy and a D7 so never anything with any mopping capability.
Thanks!"
"ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+ ReviewFirst off lets start by saying that I've tried...  
Roomba i7  
Roomba j7  
Roborock s7  


I personally think ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro is the best robot that I've had to date, especially for it's price on the market. I'm confused as to why I was recommended against getting it. I'm confused why these other robots get far better ratings than this one.  


**Pros**

* Has ""workable"" object avoidance.
* Is capable of mopping where you can even set the water flow.
* Avoids carpets if mop is attached (can be a pro or con depending on your layout).
* Lidar system that works extremely well.
* Is capable of going on medium pile carpet and rugs without getting stuck.
* Isn't dumb as a ^(robo)rock.
* Great app with a lot of functionality and customization which most robots don't have.

**Cons**

* Has as much cliff sensitivity as the J7, which is overly high and avoids even slightly dark carpets, but can be fixed with a workaround.
* Had a few issues here and there at first, such as getting on the charging station and avoiding objects, but it sorted itself out and functioned better the second time around, most likely because it was still learning.
* Rollers get a lot of hair stuck in them unlike the silicone ones, can be issue with pet owners, but I'm not one so I don't really care.
* Battery life is pretty low especially if you have carpets, but if you vacuum one room at a time or have it finish what it left off, you shouldn't have any real problems.
* Does not have a light like the J7 to assist with object avoidance.

**Controversy**

* There is absolutely nothing wrong with the app. I never had any issues with it thus far and it functions better than any other robot app that I've used. There is plenty of customization and the ability to tell the robot to vacuum a box area I set myself, is truly impressive. I am perplex as to what people are talking about and I'm assuming there must of been issues in the past, but as a new customer, I see no problems with it at all. Everything must have been ironed out and fixed.
* The self emptying bin has always fully sucked up debris from the robot's canister. I don't have pets, so maybe that's why, but my wife does have very long hair and her hair is also thick. We haven't thoroughly vacuumed the house for at least two weeks and even so, not a single problem. Experience may be different for pet owners, but if you're not a pet owner, then you shouldn't have an issue.

I can only assume that the people that hate this robot are pet owners and they are a majority, especially in America. However if you're not a pet owner, or if you only have a single dog that doesn't shed much, I really think this is the best purchase as of right now."
"Need to replace a Roborock S5- switch to Roomba J7+, or upgrade Roborock to S7?Live in a 1200 sqft apartment (mostly low-pile carpet with a few tiled areas) and have 4 cats. I bought a Roborock S5 in Dec 2019 that has worked flawlessly, up until recently (keep getting error codes about the left wheel circuit, and I’m not confident replacing the wheel will fix the issue). I’ve been very happy with the LIDAR mapping and the cleaning capabilities, but because of the mechanical issues and my concerns about support, I’ve been thinking about making the switch to a Roomba j7+. I mop the tiled areas separately, so I’m more concerned with the vacuum capabilities over the mopping ones. Having never owned a Roomba before, is the LIDAR on the Roborock that much more effective than the camera/V-slam system on the Roomba? I’m hesitant to spend almost double on something like the S7 Max V Plus when I’m not anticipating using the mopping function, and I’ve heard the area where Roomba shines is carpet/pet hair."
"Best Vacuum + Mop robotI am considering between the Dreame W10, Ecovac X1 Turbo/ Omni and Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra. 

I need a decent mopping capability to replace manual vacuum and mopping. I also would like to have cleaning solution available for the robot mop and best if it is affordable. Navigation would be nice if it is allow for me to no longer need to always prepare my house, pick up all the clothes, shoes and yoga mat off the floor before the cleaning starts. Self empty bin is one of the least important feature that I care about so maybe X1 Turbo is fine.

Dreame W10 seems to be a lot cheaper than others. 24 months warranty as compared to Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra. However the navigation does not have those front facing sensors which is disappointing.

Ecovac X1 significantly more expensive than Dreame but cheaper than Roborock. Also I heard that the water flow is kinda lacking which is a concern. Not sure if it is fixed. Comes with 24 months warranty which is good. Has front sensors for navigation. 

Roborock the most expensive of the 3. I am pretty happy with the Roborock S6 I am currently using. I have concern that the mopping capability is weaker than the other 2 since it is just a vibrating mopping pat. Has front sensors for navigation so it is a plus point over the Dreame W10."
"Robo Vac Repairability?What robot vacuum or robot vacuum company is the most ""repairable"", most ""open"", has available parts, and/or has an easy warranty process?

I ask as i've been looking for my first robot vacuum, was initially SOLD on the Yeedi Vac Station [https://www.amazon.com/Station-Self-Emptying-Editable-Schedule-Boundary/dp/B092VCXDB1/ref=cm\_cr\_arp\_d\_product\_top?ie=UTF8](https://www.amazon.com/Station-Self-Emptying-Editable-Schedule-Boundary/dp/B092VCXDB1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)

While it initially seemed INCREDIBLE for the price, pretty much only good robo vac in that price range that auto empties and mops, I quickly realized after looking through reviews from actual customers that the company is not fulfilling warranties, is impossible to contact customer service, no actual customer service number only an email, and so you can just be left with a $500 dollar paperweight. I am still considering it if I can repair it myself, but I simply can't find information on that from a newish brand like Yeeti.

But when I started to do research on repair friendly robot vacuums, I encountered very little info. I saw MENTIONS in places (this one comment section of a robot vacuum review channel) that Roborock is the most repairable among the robot vacuum companies, but I don't even know what that means. Everyone's idea of ""repair-friendly"" is different. And of course Roborock's equivalent model is practically double the price if you put their 300$ auto empty bin bundled with a compatible and comparible robo vac model. Roomba's are apparently good for self-repair as well, with lots of spare parts floating around.

Is there any robot vacuum y'all would recommend? Preferably with a serviceable battery as that is the part of any piece of tech that WILL fail at some point. I am a techie who is capable of servicing their own devices given enough info online and parts availability, so it's not the end of the world if there is bad warranty, just as long as parts are available to repair myself."
"Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 920 VS pet hairHi, I'm trying to find the best option for pet hair. I have a big husky and he lose is hair a lot ! with my Deebot, I tried 2 thing first with the main brush, and the hair alway stuck around, he does some pet stack every where in the house and the dust bin is always full. so I tried to remove the main brush. and the result is obviously no pet hair stuck around the brush but he does the same stack of hair every where AND the dust bin stay empty ( so I guest that the deebot didn't do a real big job )

"Front Laser vs LIDAR and Vibrating Mops (iHome vacuums)I currently have a Roomba i6+, which has been working great for the last 6 months. I particularly love that it has a self-emptying base, so I can have it run its routine every morning and not have to worry about intervening. I have it mapped out to do my upstairs as well, but find that I don't use it nearly as much there because it will get confused about where it is, can't self-empty there, etc. I was thinking about getting a cheaper vacuum upstairs and saw the Wyze Robot Vacuum was on sale for about $165 at Walmart. I then saw that they had sales on several iHome vacuums with a self-emptying base and mopping abilities. These were the differences in the models:

Eclipse Pro: $215, gyroscope navigating, vibrating mop

Luna Pro: $250, front laser navigating, vibrating mop

Nova (non-pro): $200, Lidar navigating, non-vibrating mop

Nova Pro: $400, Lidar navigating, vibrating mop



Does anyone know the benefits of Lidar vs a front laser? I know the lidar does 360 degrees, but does this make a notable difference in speed, mapping capabilities, etc? It seems like most current robot vacuums use either VSLAM (like my current Roomba) or Lidar, so I couldn't find much info about the front laser.

Also, does a vibrating mop make a big difference in cleaning over a regular mop?"
"S7 MaxV Ultra vs not sure?Hello

I’m in the market for a new vac/mop combo.  This will be my first robo vaccum.  Can I please receive some suggestions aside from the MaxV Ultra?

- I care more about the vaccum capability than mopping.  Mopping is an added plus I’d be happy to have…but don’t need. 

- I would prefer something that Requires the least amount of interaction with the vaccum (no adding on pieces for mopping capability…etc).  I simply want to empty the dust bag or change the water when absolutely needed.

-I would also like to control the vaccum when I’m away to monitor the house. 

My budget is $1000.  But I’d be willing to pay a little more for something that handles everything I need and want.  

Note: I was interested in the X1 OMNI but If I’m paying $1500, I don’t want to manually add on the mop functionality.  I would prefer something cheaper that just does vacuuming if that is the case.  However, It looks like the roborock meets most of my needs?"
"Small apt: 2 dogs 2 catsHi! I’m hoping you can help me make a decision. 

I have a 800sq ft apartment that is half laminate half medium pile carpet, 3 rooms (1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 living room/kitchen). No kids. 

The main issue is I have two shelties (double coated dogs) and two cats (litter tracking).

I have been researching but with so many options now a days I find myself a bit overwhelmed. I think I have ruled out mopping capabilities since the good ones are up there in price and I don’t want to go over $500, maybe $600 if it’s an amazing robot).

Self emptying would make my life easier but not a deal breaker if it gets the job done well and has a large storage so I don’t have to empty it mid-cleaning. If it’s quiet even better but not a big deal if not. 

I have narrowed it down to these:

1. Dreametech Z10
2. Irobot j7+
3. Eufy x8
4. Dreametech D10 (only mop/vacuum on my list)

Any additional recommendations are welcome. Thank so much!"

How good can the S5 Max deep clean shaggy carpets in your experience?

"Good that my robovac doesn't crash my furniture...I received the AIRROBO P10 for 2-3 days after placing the order for it. The vacuum came with the vacuum itself, a brush for cleaning, the charger adapter, and the remote control. Functionality wise after testing it for a few days, it does a nice job cleaning. The motion is pretty smooth and the vacuum has a good line of direction to make sure that it is not missing a spot. Tested the remote functionality and they work well too. Would recommend using this in a big spacey room with no obstacles in place. When it goes off a ledge, it climbs back on surface by itself as well and does not get stuck. The design of the vacuum is sleek, nicely finished. It doesn’t damage your furniture like some of the old models of robo vacuums. Few things that can be improved would be the size can be a bit shorter so that it can fit under more furniture. Some of the competitors are not offering also mopping capabilities, automatic dumping of the dirt. But for a good price, this vacuum offers what the basic robo vacuum needs. We typically vacuum once every 2 weeks or so, and this helps with the vacuuming of larger spaces. Great addition to the cleaning tools!

"Need Help Finding the Right Vacuum**Previously Used Vacuums & Issues**

Roomba I7+

* Rams into walls and furniture.
* No mopping capabilities.
* Didn't work properly in darkness.

Roomba J7+

* Rams into walls and furniture.
* No mopping capabilities.
* Very sensitive cliff sensor which refused to go on very light gray carpet.

Roborock S7

* Silicone side spinner kept getting tangled in the carpet rendering the vacuum useless. Apparently there is 3rd parties selling alternative spinners that are not made out of silicone.
* Even with the side spinner removed, the roborock does a terrible job on carpet. When on carpet and it runs into something with it's bumper, it turns rather than backs up, which makes it grind against the object and gets it stuck frequently.

**What I Need**

* Mop capabilities, doesn't need to be perfect.
* Medium to low pile carpets capabilities, doesn't need to be perfect.
* Lidar.
* Object avoidance.
* Price doesn't matter, but obviously want something that's worth the value."
"Picked up a MAMNV Vacuum and have questions?Specifically this one - https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09MD8RYT7 when it was on lightning deal, the page says it has an app and there is Alexa capabilities.  for the life of me, I cannot figure out what app to use as nothing shows in the Play store (Apple only perhaps?) the device doesn't seem to have a wifi indicator or any sort of configuration except the included remote, that being said, even if the remote is needed, this is a damn fine 'bot, strong vacuum and generous water tank. 

In my checks, I've found that this may be a rebranded GTTVO device, but nothing solid on that. 

Does anyone know if there is any app that works?"
"Roomba J7+ vs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVIHi,

I am shopping for my first robot vacuum and have narrowed my choices down to those two. The main reason is that I can get either one at Costco so I would be well covered in case of defects. Price is very similar (100$ difference with auto-emptying base). I looked at Roborock and other brands but they seemed to be harded to come by in Canada...

So, here is what I am looking for in a robot vacuum:

\- 900 sqft house with 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen, 1 living room on the main floor.

\- Every room is separate and the bedrooms are either side of a corridor.- I have 3 dogs and 2 children so logs of dog hairs and some toys on the ground at anytime.

\- All floors are hardwood or ceramic apart from the livingroom which has a carpet in the middle of the room.

\- House mapping and object recognition is important to me. I don't want to babysit the robot and want to be able to have it do the whole house a couple times a week and the kitchen, living room, and corridor, every day without it always getting stuck.

\- Mopping is not a decisive feature for me but nice-to-have.

\- Parts availability: I don't want a paper weight in 6 months if it breaks and I want consumables to be easy to get, either at Costco or on Amazon.

\- Software: A good app that is well maintained. Same for the robot if possible, regular updates to fix issues or provide new features. I don't want to have a device that feels abandoned 6 months in.

From what I understand, both are very good robots. The Roomba seems to have the edge on actual cleaning but may be lacking in terms of mapping as it doesn't sport a LIDAR. Object recognition seems to be really good and the ""POOP"" warranty is interesting. The Deebot seems to have better mapping capabilities but the app seems to be less good. Object recognition also seemed to be a bit less reliable than the Roomba. The mopping attachement is interesting but I am not sure how effective that really is.

So, has anyone on here tried those two and could provide some real world experience? Which one would you suggest I go with?

Thanks!"
"How do these things handle multiple floors?I'm a tech buff that's had bad robot vacuum experiences...so I've waited. My wife is pushing me to get another one, but she's insisting that we'd just relocate it from one floor to the next. We have 3 floors to manage.

I don't know how to look up this specific capability. Can you relocate the vacuum to a new floor, or is the expectation that you have a different one for each floor so it can leave the charging station and return to recharge, and then resume cleaning?

I've told her that we should get one, determine if it's good enough, and then buy the ""next generation"" and put the previous generation on a different floor. This is what we normally do with other technology. I just need to answer her question about whether it can do more than one floor.

Thanks!"
"Looking for advice as I start my vacuum searchHey all,

I am looking to get a vacuum/mop combo (could be convinced for 2 devices if it makes sense) to handle my 2 story, 3000 sqft house. I want to have one device to start that I can move between floors. We have 2 yellow labs who leave their toys everywhere. Poop indoors is rare but I don’t want to have one of the horror stories. The main floor is almost all hard wood with some rugs and the 2nd floor is about half wood/half carpet. Carpets low to medium pile and all rugs are short. Last part that’s a bonus is the smart home capabilities and integration to Home Assistant. Any input of what to look for like LiDAR vs VSLAM is greatly appreciated"
"360 S7 Pro and rampsSo, I have a room spit into two spaces, a main area and a corridor. The corridor is higher and to overcome the tall step I improvised a ramp made with two, ehm... marble slab I found in the house when I purchased it.

[The ramp](https://preview.redd.it/uohiolasstl81.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=675e588f97677be5263c59e535872f43f602d395)

The problem is that while the robot is physically capable of engaging the ramp (in remote control mode it goes both up and down), it decides there is a wall roughly in the middle.

&#x200B;

[\(I put no-go zones on the side to avoid the 'bot getting stuck\)](https://preview.redd.it/ekafgdcettl81.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6dedc464789b115690bc4907e87ff15498ca752a)

I assume it's the ramp incline that gets detected as an obstacle, as after a certain length it's up the level of the LIDAR sensor. I tried making the robot start from the higher room, in order to avoid this. It kinda works, but it puts the wall as soon as it climbs down the ramp. :D

Maybe I would need a longer but less steep ramp, but that would be kinda ridiculous, at it would become very long. I can, of course, just move it up once it finishes room 1, but I'm curious if someone managed to use ramps for such tall steps."

1. Self charging

2. Self emptying/disposing - although could also do without this

4. Good cleaning/suction, preferably with lidar technology.

So far I'm leaning towards the proscenic M7 pro but wanted to know if there are any similar ones out there in the same price range in Canada?

Thank you"
"Garage-competent robot vacuums?I'm looking for ways to automatically keep my garage floor clean.  One option is the  Makita DRC200Z, which is an ""industrial"" robot that could do the job, but I have zero experience with it, and it has mixed reviews.

I am guessing leaves, small rocks, mud, dust, and similar to be what it needs to gather.

I worry about the robot bonking up against the paint on my low clearance sport cars, or getting stuck and crushed under other cars.

I wonder if something with mopping capability might be a better choice?

What would you recommend for 3-car garage with nice flooring to keep it clean?"
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Retired Braava available for partsMods: Please feel free to delete if this is inappropriate, but I didn't see anything against it.

I have a 3-year old Braava Jet 240 that stopped functioning properly the other week - something *inside* the wheels/axle-housing-black-box isn't working right, so the lil' guy can't move anymore.  3 years old means it's out of warrantee, and iRobot isn't exactly helpful (as you might suspect).

So what's the upshot? Well, if you're the kind of person who's a little more capable of DIY repairs, you might want this little dude for spare parts.  I'm happy to send him along to a new home to be disassembled and given new purpose.  I also have a grip of spare disposable pads I'll throw in.  All I ask is for you to cover shipping.  I'll be using pirateship to send from 32301 in Florida, if you need to guesstimate how much that would be."
"S9+ Alternatives?Recently purchased an S9+, my first robo vacuum. When it works, it’s great. Really like the self emptying bin and cleaning power. 

The issue is that I’m constantly getting Error 31. Given the prevalence of the error, I’m not sure that a new replacement will perform much better. 

Are there any good alternatives at the “premium” level? Ideally would have self emptying capability, strong cleaning and navigational features (have a pet that sheds), and is reliable. 

Some of the new 2021 CES models look promising but are also untested and I’m not sure when they’re coming out. 

Any good alternatives?"
"Analysis-paralysis Before PurchaseOk, so my wife and I had a Roomba 650 for a couple years but sold it. It never seemed to do a great job, regularly got stuck under furniture, and overall was fairly ""dumb"". With no app, house mapping, etc we were unable to set custom routines or ask it to go clean a room. Furthermore we have been seeing the auto-empty features slowly get adopted, and think we want to get a new one. We (my wife) like the Roomba S9+, but I am really starting to toy with the idea of the Ozmo T8 or T8 AIVI. However I have a couple questions.

1) Does the ""D"" shape of the S9+ really clean the corners better than an ""O"" shaped vac?

2) Are the T8/T8+ and T8 AIVI not good, I noticed they weren't in the side bar?

3) Considering the T8+ is about $200 cheaper than the T8 AIVI and Auto-Empty station is it really that much worse? With 2 Dogs, being able to identify and move around dog toys, water bowls, not get stuck under furniture, etc. If the object identification is that much better on the AIVI then it would be worth it to me. 

4) Our floors are hardwood with low-pile area rugs, does the Roomba really clean that much better than the Ecovacs?

5) Are there any other options I should be considering? Or is there about to be any sort of vacuum robot revolution where next year's vacs will be significantly more capable than this year's?

6) Which option is less likely to rise up and murder us in our sleep when the AI becomes self-aware?"

"Looking for a robot mop for about 2k sq ft.We have hardwood and tile that we need a robot mop for. About 2k sq ft.

We would like to be able to tell it to only mop certain rooms, so good mapping capabilities are a must.

As far as vacuum, we don't have a problem getting a separate robot for that so it doesn't have to be a combo robot if that means compromises on the quality of mopping or vacuuming. Also mopping is the more important part. I'm sure most vacuums will do a good enough job, we've had those before. 

I'm not to concerned with the price as long as they work well but I would prefer not to spend more than 1500 USD total for vacuum + mop.

Thanks."
"Help me choose the right vac/mopSo I have the opportunity to buy a robot vacuum for our new house, and would really like one with an additional mopping feature, that will vacuum and mop at the same time, like a robotic Bissel Crosswave.   


Our house is 2 stories, mostly laminate wood flooring (that is dark and gets covered in dog fur, sand and dust every day, so the idea of something that vacuums and mops them every day is a dream) but we have 5 ruggable rugs, 3 of which are large and under furniture so I can't easily remove them for daily/weekly floor cleaning  


I was about to buy the Roborock E35 Robot Vacuum and Mop but then I learned that it doesn't sense a carpet & stop mopping like the Deebot M80 does. I don't think I want to mop my carpets, so I was going to get the Deebot M80. But then I read it doesn't have any mapping capability so when I move it between floors, it's going to start re-learning the area each time and bumping into everything.   


Then I read, in contradiction to the reviews, that the Deebot M80 doesn't actually sense carpet after all so back to the Roborock E35 and mopping the carpets.   


In short, I'm trying to find something that will be able to daily vacuum and mop my hard floors, vacuum without mopping my carpets, learn its way around 2 floors, and not cost over $500. Does such a thing exist?   


If not, what would the best solution be? Ultimately, getting the floors mopped and vacuumed every day is more important to me than vacuuming the carpets which I can stand to do just once a week. I've never worked with a robot vac app so I don't know what's possible. 

  
Thanks in advance for your assistance, this is a big important purchase for me and I am having a hard time with so many choices and so much information, I was hoping some personalized human help would be useful."
"Is STYTJ02YM water leak is related to fill more than just water into the water tank?I know some robots with mopping capabilities have the water leak problem, which seems famous but I'm not sure its really that common.

I suspect the problem is not only mechanical but also related to what you put into the tank.

I read the manual of the Xiaomi Mop P but it says nothing about recommendation on which product you can put on the water tank, like disinfectants, floor cleaning etc. Perhaps by the name we should assume it can only hold water?

I'm asking because the fix is quite a lot of trouble, requiring 3D printing object and then glue.

\*\*I would like to know if YOU have this problem and if you use anything rather than pure water in your robot.\*\*"
"360 S10 vs Roborock S6 MaxvGreetings All,

Our home pretty much has toys and lego blocks scatter on the floor as we have got young children.

I have been eyeing on the Roborock S6 MaxV since its release last year due to its AI computer vision capability.

I done extensive research on it and it seems that the MaxV not only has blind spots, its computer vision navigation capability isn't that reliable.

The new 360 S10 uses 3 LIDARs. 1 x front mounted long range for general navigation, 1 x front mounted short range to detect objects as small as 1cm, and a side mounted Lidar to reduce blind spots.

Would you go for the S10 or MaxV?

TIA!"
"Any with only local network access?Just got a Roborock s4 max but after discovering its security issues, privacy policies, and network traffic usage I've decided to return it.

Are there any robot vacuums that are accessible only via local network? I don't need to turn on my vacuum from another country but I do like some of the app features.

If not, are there any recommendations for one that has decent navigation without any wifi capabilities?

Thanks"
"Interesting issue with deebot 500Hello! I have a Deebot 500 that is showing a drive wheel malfunction in the app. So when you go to turn it on, it will go forward about two inches, back up about a foot and spin in a circle. Then it throws the error to the app. But if you try to start it again after that, it will drive itself forwards across the floor for a few feet, (without the vacuum on) even bumping into things and correcting itself before throwing the error again. So it appears to be capable of driving/steering but not doing that and vacuuming? Any ideas what’s going on here?"
"Best Mid-Range option?Hi all,

Wanting to get my first robovac, and feeling pretty confused, so I have a few questions I was hoping you could help with:

1. Is it worth spending more? Will a £1000 guy really do that much better than the £500 guy?


2. Is it worth getting a self empty station?


3. What is the best mid-range?
Amazon has a few self empty options that seem decent, but I honestly have no clue:

"Shark IQ isn't working with Alexa or Google HomeI have the RV1101ARUS. We got it back in 12\21. For the first month or so it was working fine. Now when we try to have it clean a specific room with Google or Alexa it won't work. It works with the shark App though, when that in itself doesn't crash. I've been dealing with shark for over a month now. Originally they said it was a Alexa skill issue because it was working with the App. Then it dawned on me a few weeks later to just install Google home on my phone. It responds the same as Alexa. You tell it to do a specific room and it just cleans wherever it wants. So after more than 15 hours of troubleshooting on the phone, I call shark back and tell them this to try and have them send me another one through warranty. The rep then tells me that her manager has just informed her that they disabled that feature in the Alexa skill and you can only clean specific rooms with the App. I asked when they changed it and they said sometime in January. So basically around the time I first called them. The customer service at Shark works as followed. You call and get a troubleshooting tech. Then if you're lucky you get a call back from an advanced tech. Then if you're even luckier you get a call back from the advanced tech escalation team. Still waiting to hear back from them. There's no direct number. They've lied to me multiple times and I've had multiple empty promises. I don't know what else to do. I wouldn't have bought it had it not worked with the Alexa integration. All the Apps and firmware are up to date. Deleted the maps and device. Factory reset many times. Deleted Alexa skill and app. Deleted Shark App. Did all these things multiple times. Room names are all default. The best way I can explain it is that communication is a 2 way street. It's receiving them command but not processing the instructions correctly. On 2 different occasions I even had a shark advance tech live stream in to see what it was doing. Luckily I record all my phone calls with them so I have proof of all the deception. Any help would be much obliged. Also don't expect them to do any leg work in terms of talking to Alexa for you. That's all on you. What a nightmare. Literally over 15 hours on the phone and going."

"Shark IQ robot and choosing roomsDoes anyone's Shark robot actually go to the assigned room to clean?

I have an accurate map of my floor plan, each room labled. I tell it to clean ONLY one specific room across the house, and it leaves the dock and just cleans it's base room and the rest of the house as if it wasn't assigned anything.

It's annoying to tell you the truth. You spend hundreds for the AI, and you end up having to use it like a normal cleaner, blocking it off into rooms."
"Shark AI Robot Vacuum having trouble making cleaning report mapsRecently switched from a roomba 800 to a shark AI. My roomba was sadly put in hospice care after it’s steady decline, probably from sucking one to many pee puddles from my dog who had been incontinent (he is awaiting his roomba friend in the afterlife). 

Anyway I got the shark AI, love shark products, so far love this vacuum. But I have run it 5 times (apart from the explore run) and only once (the first time) was it able to generate a cleaning report map. Ever since I get [this in my report.](https://imgur.com/a/oWTFtiu) I’ve tried clearing more obstacles but it really isn’t any different than when it originally mapped. Or maybe it’s subtly different and I don’t notice? Should I do another explore run?"
"Shark app only half workingI got a new Shark XL self emptying robot today. The app on my phone receives information from the robot, charge % etc, but the robot does not respond when I tell it through the app to start or return to base. Information only going one way. Any ideas?"
"Scheduling the Shark IQ Vac to clean specific rooms one at a time.So finally figured out a way to automate the Shark by room in a schedule. I have two dogs one of which is long haired and we need the vac to run daily otherwise I have tumble weeds of hair rolling about the house. 

While the Shark IQ states is good for pet hair, they didn't have an Anatolian Shepherd in mind and we found if we do it one room at a time so it empties more frequently, it works better and the dust cup doesn't clog  

I have a few Alexa devices with the shark skill installed and configured for my account so I can use voice commands when needed. 

On my phone I went into the Alexa app and started a new routine:

-	Tap settings and select routine 
-	Tap the + sign to add a new routine 
-	Enter a name for the routine. I used '9am Shark Clean Living Room' for example so each routine is easily identified. 
-	Under 'When this happens' select Schedule 
-	Enter a time and the days of the week to run. 
-	Under 'Add action' enter in the voice commands exactly as you would speak it. 
-	EX: 'tell shark to have <insert robot name> start cleaning the Living Room'
-	pick an Alexa device to execute the command from if you have more than one. I selected the dot in the living room. 
-	Save the new routine. 

You can then go back into the routine, tap the three dots and select copy routine to make one for the next room and so on. 

I made sure all of my rooms were typed in as I have theilisted in the app. 

For the five rooms I wanted to target daily, I spaced them an hour apart for now. Once these run a few times, I'll get a better idea of the actual time they take and tighten up the schedule. 

NOTE: while the question being asked isn't verbally heard when the time kicks off, the Alexa unit will respond verbally as if you asked it."
"A Critical Review of Popular Vacuum Robot Brands**1. iRobot Roombas**

Roombas are some of the most Reliable overpriced vacuums with a stable and feature-rich app. They don't have LiDARs yet. They don't have the best navigation or object avoidance, and yet they just work.

They are some of the best-rated vacuums out there. That, however, doesn't change the fact that they are highly overpriced for not being even half as smart as most competitors.

**2. Ecovacs Deebots**

Ecovacs has an impressive range of products but only on paper. The buggy room mapping overlaps walls, misinterprets closed doors as walls, forgets room labels every single time. This makes their products totally useless which is really sad as the vacuums by themselves are impressive.

Most issues they have can be fixed with a software update. Sadly, the team hasn't been able to fix any. They'd rather spend their budget on marketing and hiring as many influencers as they can to recommend their products. I'm sure you'll witness that live in the comments section.

**3. 360 Robots**

360 has the best navigation and mapping in the market programmed by a team specialized in building driverless cars. Also, they have the laziest implementation of an Alexa Skill. You can only turn the vacuum on and off using Alexa after which you'll have to open the app anyway.

360 vacuums give you the most value for your money. However, many users have reported that these vacuums need to connect to a server in China. The vacuum is just a piece of plastic if that server is down, which is the case most of the time.

**4. Roborocks**

Roborocks are the only ones on the list that offer convenience by not trading your cleaning problem with a technical one. They are great at mapping rooms, navigating efficiently, and avoiding objects. The app is stable and has all the necessary features. The only downside is the availability of after-sales support based on your country.

**Conclusion:** While we are busy admiring technical specifications, most of us tend to forget that technology is intended to make our lives easier. In the initial phases of anything new, the work reduced is just replaced by the additional effort of dealing with the technical challenges of the product.

So far, the vacuum robot market can be summarized as follows:

**1. Vacuums that have nailed the basics of cleaning but can't deal with tricky situations:** Like the Roombas that might need your help every now and then to move the furniture around

**2. Vacuums that have mastered the tricky situations but can't get the basics right:** Like the Ecovacs with their buggy mapping and app.

**3. Vacuums that have nailed everything but turned their product into total garbage by adding a dependency over a remote server to perform basic cleaning:** Like the 360s

**4. Vacuums that are just perfect with almost everything you need but you can't buy them fearing the lack of after-sales support:** Like the Roborocks"
"Garage-competent robot vacuums?I'm looking for ways to automatically keep my garage floor clean.  One option is the  Makita DRC200Z, which is an ""industrial"" robot that could do the job, but I have zero experience with it, and it has mixed reviews.

I am guessing leaves, small rocks, mud, dust, and similar to be what it needs to gather.

I worry about the robot bonking up against the paint on my low clearance sport cars, or getting stuck and crushed under other cars.

I wonder if something with mopping capability might be a better choice?

What would you recommend for 3-car garage with nice flooring to keep it clean?"
"Ecovacs DEEBOT OZMO T8+ is on sale at Best Buy in the USA for $449.99 ($300 price reduction)[Here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecovacs-robotics-deebot-t8-vacuum-mop-robot-with-advanced-laser-mapping-and-3d-obstacle-detection-avoidance-grey/6423195.p?skuId=6423195) is the link to the listing on the US site for Best Buy. Regular price is $749.99. It's the T8+ - the + just means it comes with the self-emptying bin. This is **not** the AIVI version with the front camera, but I have seen more favorable reviews for this version, anecdotally.

I have heard this is a common sale, but it may be a couple months before it goes on sale once this offer is over.

The N8+ (not the Pro version) is available for $499.99 from $599.99 at Best Buy as well. However, the N8 Pro+ is available on Amazon for $594.99 from $799.99, if that's to your liking instead. It's to be noted that the [OZMO Pro Mopping](https://www.amazon.com/Ecovacs-Mopping-Scrubbing-Feature-Accessory/dp/B08GH3N618/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=deebot+n8&qid=1627064335&sr=8-10) add-on is only compatible with the T8 and the T8 AIVI

&#x200B;

Overall, I have seen mixed reviews for Ecovacs including some that say the company will offer you a $100 Amazon gift card to remove a negative review, which could mean that the reviews that *are* present artificially skew positive. VacuumWars on YouTube loved the T8 AIVI and the N8 Pro and claims to not be sponsored by Ecovacs and purchased the vacs out of pocket, but some are either suspicious of this claim or outright contend it.

In my limited research, people have a lot of strong feelings about Ecovacs one way or another, and it's hard to verify the integrity of reviews that are openly sponsored, of which there are many. Some are wary of the quality of the devices due to allegedly lower manufacturing standards in China where Ecovacs is based and there are concerns over the longevity of the devices since the company is relatively young. Many complain about the quality and reliability of the app and have issues with the self-emptying bin clogging.

That being said, a lot of this is true or there is some analog for all the robot vacuum companies I have researched recently. Issues with performance, issues with veracity of reviews, lack of features or misalignment between needs of the user and the features offered by the device, quality of manufacturing, and value for money. It seems there is no perfect robot vacuum. Some decry the very notion and suggest you'd do better to get a bagged, corded Miele from 1985 off of eBay and enjoy a feat of German engineering whenever you clean your house.

In the end, I took advantage of this deal today and purchased the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8+ from Best Buy as my first ever robot vacuum. It seems worth at least trying at that price point for what is a competing top-line robovac (by some estimates) with a mopping feature. I also opted to pick up the OZMO Pro Mopping add-on from Amazon. Not on sale, but still come out around the same as I would for the N8 Pro+ at the current sale and it can't handle the mopping upgrade.

I can't speak to anyone else's needs, but me getting a fancy manual vacuum instead of a robot will result in a new stationary friend for my current vacuum that remains so very rarely used. I work from home, have a kid, another on the way, and if this little critter will give me one less thing to worry about, even if it's imperfect, it's worth the risk/investment."
"Does a Scoopa replacement robot exist?I've had 3 second-hand Scoobas (380/390) that serve greaty to the mission of keeping our floor clean. I don't regreat buying them, but each lasted only few months. After repairing and replacing several parts they get back to life for few months and then another part needs fixing/replacement.

I guess that evidences why iRobot decided to stop selling them, and I can see how difficult can be to build cleanin robots that mix hydraulics, electronics, pumps, etc.

I also gave a try to several mops (Braava, attached mops to vacuum cleaners, etc) which I don't think are worth. They serve their purpose to do superficial cleaning, but nothing compared to the work that the Scooba perform.

Do you think there is a real candidate that can compete with the old Scoobas? I've seen a similar product( iLife W400) which doesn't get much publicity, and my feeling is that the new iRobot mops wouldn't perform much better than the old Braavas (came from Mint)"
"My experience: S9+ / M6 vs S5Max vs T8+I’ve been wanting to write up my experiences with these devices so far, but responded to a comment in Roomba about the S9+ and am pasting that instead. Would be happy to answer any specific questions:

I actually do have the i7 variant from Costco. As soon as it shipped the S9+ / M6 combo went on sale and jumped on it, but decided not to open the i7. Also have S5Max and T8 that I’ve been testing.

I haven’t had problems with S9+ others are having thankfully other than Roomba is less intelligent than the LIDAR technology based competitors. It takes a lot more effort to train but afterwards is mostly competent.

I will say It does clean much better, the self empty design is superior to T8, and is only one that can detect bin is full (it also has larger capacity bin than the others). IMO definitely the most sexy design. Also from an American company based in US with the best support.

On flip side is loud, takes much longer to clean than the LIDAR devices and doesn’t have real time cleaning progress like the LIDARS. It bumps into everything while training which takes 2+ runs to create the map. I joke that it’s gravitated to my subwoofer as it bumped into it constantly until I was able to create a no go zone.

The S5Max is well rounded with superior navigation. In my house you just set it and forget it. But questionable support, average cleaning and does not have auto empty.

T8 is best value for what I paid but S5Max has better navigation. The T8 often forgets how to get back to the base when I use it for mopping and self empty isn’t designed properly to empty when dander clumps up.

The S9+ is either the best and worst in every category. If price matters I’d recommend the T8 or S5Max. Even if it doesn’t you want to determine if S9+ is right for you. For a lot the i7 seems to be better.

I’m at the moment leaning towards keeping S9+ M6 (need more time with M6), but if a successor is announced anytime soon with LIDAR , I’d instantly exchange it for that.

Edit 1: background, I live in a 3 story, 3000 sqft house with dogs. Floors are hardwood with rugs in almost every room.  I don’t auto schedule as I have to pick up a few rooms in advance before I run the robot.  My goal is to run once a week. If I wait a week the T8 isn’t able to self empty as the dander becomes clumped.  The bin isn’t full but it’s an inefficient design to empty compared to room as. To avoid that I need it to run every 3 days-ish. 

I bought S5Max for $435 on Prime Day. T8 for $450 a week later at Beat Buy. i8 from Costco for $580 on BF and S9+ / M6 combo, both matching colors for $1150 from iRobot a few days later.  As mentioned I never opened the i8. 

I previously said if the T8 deal never came around I would have been perfectly happy with S5Max as it’s the best navigation in my house. My biggest complaint is the small collection bin. Otherwise it runs without much oversight needed.  This all started the giant rabbit hole where I am now. 

I also read the replacement parts for Roborock are hard to come by as they are intending these to be disposable (not sure if true). 

I really only need mopping in my kitchen as it’s connected to entries and my main bathroom with its tile floor."
"How often to change water tanks for auto-wash/dry/refill docks?With models like Omni T20, Roborock Revo/S8 Pro Ultra etc, that have water exchange tanks, how often do I change these water tanks? Okay to leave 3 or 4 days? Or does it get dicey.

"Need a robot to replace a Neato XV-11Looking for suggestions on a robot to replace a frankly very long-lived and dependable XV-11, which has died. (Dead screen and other issues.)  


I'm not expecting a replacement machine to last as long as this one did.  I bought it back when they were first released and have only had to replace batteries and give it a good decent cleaning every month. (I like maintaining machines.)  


I don't need a smartphone app.  I would prefer something with a LIDAR or optical system like the Neato has.  I'd also very much appreciate a robot that would work with magnetic strips as I find just tossing a magnetic strip down to keep it out of a temporary problem area doesn't involve much effort.  


I'd like a system that I can just push a start button on and it just goes, as the XV-11 did. I was fine with tidying the room a bit for the  XV and I don't need something that will need a lot of fussing over.

I don't need or want an integrated mop system. I currently use a Scooba with no issues on tile floors.  


We have a mixture of tile, oak flooring, and carpet.  Something with a wide cleaning bar like the Neato would be great, especially if it has a similarly powerful suction.  I don't need the vacuum to be quiet when operating.

I looked briefly at a RoboRock q5, but I can't find any confirmation that it works with magnetic strips.  If anyone knows for sure that it does, I will just go with that."
"Garage Robot Vacuums: Any good options?I am looking for the best option for my garage to automatically keep the floors clean of tracked in debris.

Any thoughts, recommendations, experiences, words of caution or wisdom you care to share?

======== Edit: Details below =======

(I was trying to keep my post short, but since folks asked for details, here are some needs):

Going for as spotless floors as I can get, so for my particular needs I would want to pick up all the gunk the tires track in, which is mostly:

* Small bits of gravel
* Wet and dry leaves
* Mud and dust
* Water dragged in from the car, or condensation from its air conditioning.

And then also:

* The occasional dropped screw
* Occasional human messes like a small amount of sawdust, or grass and dirt tracked in from the yard.

And then I would want:

* Minimize the chance of scratching the paint on low to the floor sportcars
* Minimize the need to service it all the time due to small dustbins and the like
* Floors clean enough for walking on with white socks would be ideal.  (My cars don't leak oil, though the occasional condensation from the air conditioner, as well as tracked in water would be normal)
* Industrial enough that small sharp pebbles or a nail or other such garage debris does not ruin the robot.
* The usual obstacle and collision avoidance so it doesn't get confused by a shoe or loose cable.
* I don't have pets, though I imagine folks looking for such a robot might want to deal with pet hair and the like.
* I don't have a budget.  I would pay for perfection, or could go cheap and disposable depending on what makes sense.  I have owned many robot mops and vacuums in the past, and presently have 2 Roborock S7 Max V Ultras, and one iRobot Bravajet, which maybe will end up in the garage as they age and are replaced.

It seems the need for a garage robot is a lot different than what you would want for hardwood or carpet floors, but there is a lot of shared functionality.

The one robot that is sort-of close to what might work is the [makita drc300](https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/DRC300Z), but it seems alone in this product category, and it is really difficult to find a review that is comprehensive enough to make the buy decision from.

"Advice needed: vacuum/mopping combo for ca. 400€Hi everyone!

Currently, I have the old very first Xiaomi vacuum robot and think it is time to upgrade.

I want to buy one on Amazon Germany as I have gift card for it and the overall budget (including gift card) is ca. 400€. Advanced mopping is nice to have, obstacle recognition depends. I usually put everything away to get as much area as possible cleaned anyway. Auto empty dock not needed.

Initially, I thought about waiting for Roborock S8 release as the prices for S7 might drop. Instead, the S7 isn't available on Amazon anymore (at least in Germany). 😒

The second thought was Dreame L10s, currently available for 429€. But I saw some negative reviews and the fact that it leaves relatively big unmopped borders, is a no-go for me.

So right now, my list contains Ecovas T9/T9 AIVI (seems to offer most advanced features but Ecovacs devices are often reported to have issues with maps and getting randomly stuck), Ecovacs N8 Pro, Roborock Q7 Max (non+, available for 359-399€ right now), 360 S10, Dreame L10 Pro, Dreame D10S.

Does someone have experience with some of these? Which one would you pick?

Many thanks! 😁"

"Any ideas how a robot vacuum would navigate a narrow strip of hardwood floor with rug on one side and wall on the other?I'm specifically looking at the DEEBOT T10+, and am looking around my house to see how well it might do.  That unit is also a mop, so I'm looking around my house to see how it might do before pulling the trigger.  We have a rug in my family room (floor is hardwood) and  there is one strip of wood on one side of the rug where about 1 foot of hard wood is exposed.  On the other end is a part of our fireplace.  Forgive me, I don't know what it's called but it's solid and about four inches tall.

I don't expect the vac to climb that, but I am curious what it would do about that strip?  It literally would have to be on part rug and part hardwood to go over it at all.  Any idea what might happen here?  I imagine mopping there would be completely out of the question."

"ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+ ReviewFirst off lets start by saying that I've tried...  
Roomba i7  
Roomba j7  
Roborock s7  


I personally think ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro is the best robot that I've had to date, especially for it's price on the market. I'm confused as to why I was recommended against getting it. I'm confused why these other robots get far better ratings than this one.  


**Pros**

* Has ""workable"" object avoidance.
* Is capable of mopping where you can even set the water flow.
* Avoids carpets if mop is attached (can be a pro or con depending on your layout).
* Lidar system that works extremely well.
* Is capable of going on medium pile carpet and rugs without getting stuck.
* Isn't dumb as a ^(robo)rock.
* Great app with a lot of functionality and customization which most robots don't have.

**Cons**

* Has as much cliff sensitivity as the J7, which is overly high and avoids even slightly dark carpets, but can be fixed with a workaround.
* Had a few issues here and there at first, such as getting on the charging station and avoiding objects, but it sorted itself out and functioned better the second time around, most likely because it was still learning.
* Rollers get a lot of hair stuck in them unlike the silicone ones, can be issue with pet owners, but I'm not one so I don't really care.
* Battery life is pretty low especially if you have carpets, but if you vacuum one room at a time or have it finish what it left off, you shouldn't have any real problems.
* Does not have a light like the J7 to assist with object avoidance.

**Controversy**

* There is absolutely nothing wrong with the app. I never had any issues with it thus far and it functions better than any other robot app that I've used. There is plenty of customization and the ability to tell the robot to vacuum a box area I set myself, is truly impressive. I am perplex as to what people are talking about and I'm assuming there must of been issues in the past, but as a new customer, I see no problems with it at all. Everything must have been ironed out and fixed.
* The self emptying bin has always fully sucked up debris from the robot's canister. I don't have pets, so maybe that's why, but my wife does have very long hair and her hair is also thick. We haven't thoroughly vacuumed the house for at least two weeks and even so, not a single problem. Experience may be different for pet owners, but if you're not a pet owner, then you shouldn't have an issue.

I can only assume that the people that hate this robot are pet owners and they are a majority, especially in America. However if you're not a pet owner, or if you only have a single dog that doesn't shed much, I really think this is the best purchase as of right now."
"My experience with Eufy RoboVac X8 - I love itBefore deciding to buy this robot, I spent few weeks researching all of them, and was seriously doubting if I will be satisfied with this model, because it is not very popular compared to Roombas and Roborocks, and **literally** all the reviews I could find on YouTube were sponsored ones. This seemed very fishy to me.  
I found a few redditors to ask, who shared their experiences with owning this particular robot, and they seemed satisfied. Some other opinions that I read however, were of some people that were experiencing software issues and firmware issues (meaning the phone app and the robot not being very smart in some cases).  
So after being on the fence between RoboVac X8 and iRobot Roomba J7, I went with the Eufy, because I decided I do not need a camera, since my home is always tidied up (there are no random things on the ground, which requires a camera to detect, and ask you how to proceed).  
Also, I didn't like how the camera models are mostly dependent on good lighting conditions in order for them to work properly.  


I was very surprised to find out the robot was working very good, and there were no issues with the software. I liked how this little cutie sneaked around my whole apartment to see every inch of it, so it can create a map.  
Another surprise was when it found out on it's own where the door to the hallway was, and then divided the rooms appropriately on the map!  


My apartment is mostly low carpets, and it managed to clean them quite good, even on low suction setting. The IQ Boost also seems to work well, as it somehow decides it needs more power in some places, and then self boosts itself.  
Some people online were complaining how loud this robot was, but, like, this is a vacuum, how else would it be? Personally, I didn't find it to be too noisy **for what it is - a vacuum.**  
The virtual boundary also works really good! I have a section in the hallway, where my shoes are, so I added a No-Go Zone, and the robot worked around it very well.  


I would love it if they keep improving the phone app and the AI of the robot. Also they need to work on the brand itself, and add some personality to the robots. Currently the robot speaks with a very bland ""robotic"" voice. I would like it if they made it have some more cute, pleasant sounds and voices.  


Overall, I am very satisfied, and will definitely recommend this vacuum to friends and relatives. I am happy to support Eufy with my purchase, and would love for them to keep improving it.  
As you can tell, I am not very good at writing reviews lol, so I will happily answer any questions in the comments."
"Review of my Eufy G30 - great, but not designed to last much longer than a year.I have two dogs and a cat, and I absolutely depend on this vacuum to keep my floors clean.  Our dearest vacuum works tirelessly, day after day.  It does a great job as long as the usual hazards are kept away from the floor - strings, wires, frilly blanket ends, and stuff at just the right height to get stuck on - e.g. I put little blocks under the feet of the couch so it would have enough room to go under without getting stuck.  It picks up tons of hair, dirt, cat litter, and I love it.  
  
But this vacuum has a killer design flaw.  The mechanism that drives the main roller brush has a bearing that is not intended to be serviced.  It is deep inside the vacuum, with poor quality dust seals, and Eufy doesn't sell replacement parts for it.  This isn't the bearing at the end of the replaceable rolling brush, but just inside the vacuum where the rolling brush sockets in to the square hole for mechanical turning power.  
   
Error S5, rolling brush error.  
  
I had to completely disassemble the vacuum at just over 1 year to clean and lubricate this bearing as it refused to work and found it's dust seals worn out and basically non-existent. It's been another few months, and I'm getting error S5 again.  I'm not inclined to keep taking the vacuum apart to clean this bearing, so it's time to move on."
"Large home vacuum recommendations?We're building a new home, and planning on robovac usage (not using one currently). I've been doing some research and haven't come across definitive answers based on home size. I would like vac + mop functionality with minimal maintenance, although I realize some maintenance is required. 

Relevant factors:

**Home size**: Roughly 3200 sq ft main floor, 1800 sq ft second floor. I would expect this means 2500 sq ft and 1500 sq ft of actual flooring to clean respectively (taking furniture and such into consideration).  
**Flooring**: tile/hardwood, no carpet  
**Budget**: Open   
**Other**: One large dog that sheds year round, medium-fine 1"" hair. Two kids that are somewhat messy, crumbs, minor spills.

From my reading, it seems like going with one robovacuum per floor would be easiest, but one (depending on model) should be able to cover both floors if i was open to carrying it up and down stairs.

Would any of the newer models out there have a problem cleaning 2500 sq ft?   
Would it require two, or am I well within the bounds of using a single robot?  
Would that entail a robot supporting recharge/resume functionality?  
What are the downsides if the dock is not located centrally?

Appreciate any input. I've been looking at the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, but open to other brands/models."

"A Critical Review of Popular Vacuum Robot Brands**1. iRobot Roombas**

Roombas are some of the most Reliable overpriced vacuums with a stable and feature-rich app. They don't have LiDARs yet. They don't have the best navigation or object avoidance, and yet they just work.

They are some of the best-rated vacuums out there. That, however, doesn't change the fact that they are highly overpriced for not being even half as smart as most competitors.

**2. Ecovacs Deebots**

Ecovacs has an impressive range of products but only on paper. The buggy room mapping overlaps walls, misinterprets closed doors as walls, forgets room labels every single time. This makes their products totally useless which is really sad as the vacuums by themselves are impressive.

Most issues they have can be fixed with a software update. Sadly, the team hasn't been able to fix any. They'd rather spend their budget on marketing and hiring as many influencers as they can to recommend their products. I'm sure you'll witness that live in the comments section.

**3. 360 Robots**

360 has the best navigation and mapping in the market programmed by a team specialized in building driverless cars. Also, they have the laziest implementation of an Alexa Skill. You can only turn the vacuum on and off using Alexa after which you'll have to open the app anyway.

360 vacuums give you the most value for your money. However, many users have reported that these vacuums need to connect to a server in China. The vacuum is just a piece of plastic if that server is down, which is the case most of the time.

**4. Roborocks**

Roborocks are the only ones on the list that offer convenience by not trading your cleaning problem with a technical one. They are great at mapping rooms, navigating efficiently, and avoiding objects. The app is stable and has all the necessary features. The only downside is the availability of after-sales support based on your country.

**Conclusion:** While we are busy admiring technical specifications, most of us tend to forget that technology is intended to make our lives easier. In the initial phases of anything new, the work reduced is just replaced by the additional effort of dealing with the technical challenges of the product.

So far, the vacuum robot market can be summarized as follows:

**1. Vacuums that have nailed the basics of cleaning but can't deal with tricky situations:** Like the Roombas that might need your help every now and then to move the furniture around

**2. Vacuums that have mastered the tricky situations but can't get the basics right:** Like the Ecovacs with their buggy mapping and app.

**3. Vacuums that have nailed everything but turned their product into total garbage by adding a dependency over a remote server to perform basic cleaning:** Like the 360s

**4. Vacuums that are just perfect with almost everything you need but you can't buy them fearing the lack of after-sales support:** Like the Roborocks"
"Vacuum for Apartment then Parents HouseHi, I'm currently living in a small Apartment with vinyl flooring except for the bedroom, which I believe is high pile carpet (I measured one of the fibers as ~.7in or ~15mm).

Depending on what happens in the future, I might give the robot to my parents, who have a large two story house with all hard flooring.

I'd like a vacuum with a self emptying base. I'm not too sure with mopping, as even though I'd like it, I don't know how compatible it'd be with the carpet.

Would it be fine to just remove the mopping pads from things like the S7+, N8 Pro Plus, or yeedi Vac Station if I want it to go into the bedroom? I'd be fine still having to vacuum the carpet since it's so thick. 

No pets anywhere, so that's not an issue."
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ecyszkgf381.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c3622533c2030046dbef7725b811ae4c8140468

 

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Neato D4 (BNIB, 260 USD) vs. Deebot 900 (Refurb, 160 USD)?I am living in Canada, and caught the last-minute deal of Neato D4, **brand-new**, for **260 USD**.

Meanwhile I found a deal on Buydig which sells the **refurbished** Deebot 900 for **160 USD**.

* Both vacs adopt LDS which I appreciate.
* I heard Neato do stronger suction than Deebot.
* Deebot 900 has the side brush; Neato D4 depends only on its D-shape.
* Neato comes with the 1-year manufacturer's warranty, and I can easily return it to the nearest BestBuy if I don't like it; Deebot with the 2-year seller's warranty, although I am not sure whether the shipping fee is reimbursed if I want to return the Deebot. Actually, very unlikely since the Deebot is shipped from the U.S. to Canada using FedEx.
* Both price tags include tax, import charges, and shipping.
* I am living alone **with my cat**, at a 1BR condo, **450 sq.ft.**

Based on the description above, is Neato D4 worth extra 100 bucks over Deebot 900?"
"Shark robot vacuum soooo LOUD!Just got a new shark robot vacuum for downstairs (Shark AV2501S AI Robot Vacuum with HEPA Self-Empty Base, Bagless, 30-Day Capacity) .. we have two dogs and now two babies and the reviews seemed great on this one for dog hair. I’ve had a few different robot vacuums before but in our new house we have floor returns and they’ve always been an issue so I moved my latest upstairs and so this was an attempt to return and give it another go. 

This thing came yesterday, I set it up and let it charge. Went to give it a go and it sounds like a helicopter is landing in our living room. I had to turn it off to hear the tv. Is this how these new ones are?? I know it’s been a few years but my others were never this loud, perhaps it’s the XL capacity? 

I started going through the reviews more deeply and can’t see anyone complaining about the noise so could it be the unit? Is it worth ordering another? 

I had really hoped this would be something I could run once or even twice a day around the main level (all wood floors, one area rug) but with this noise level I can’t foresee running it during the day or what I had pictured, ideally at night."
"Shark RV2502AE AI Honeymoon ReviewI'm a long time robot vacuum owner starting off way, way back with an early model Neato around a decade ago. I always loved the way that vacuum scanned rooms and systematically cleaned, they were way ahead of their time. When it finally went kaput after around 6 years of use, we went though 2 iRobot models and 1 off brand copy with their ridiculous random vacuuming and none lasted very long. I wanted something like my early Neato but with some more modern features and ended up with the Shark RV2502AE AI. I've had it for 2.5 weeks and here's my experience:

1. Setup was super easy...but relatively slow. Not sure if that's an issue with the bot or the app (lot's of poor reviews of the earlier version of the app), but connecting to my Wi-fi took long enough that I thought it failed and was ready to start over before it gave the A-OK. The scanning run (roughly 1000 sq ft) took about 30 minutes and was remarkably accurate. It doesn't bump into anything (cough...iRobot)
2. Run time. Shark claims the unit has 120 of run time. While the app reports roughly 120 minutes to complete a run of my 1000 sq feet, the reality is it's closer to 180 minute due to 2 stops to charge. So I think it's really run time is likely less than 100 minutes, but hard to say exactly as the programming is clever here as it appears to estimate how long it needs to work and seems to take more frequent shorter charges than draining the battery very low and then charging for a long time, today it took it's first charging break at 60% when it was also taking a break to empty the bin (more below). When it finished it was still at 30%. And after it takes a charging break, it returns exactly to where it left off to finish a run. 
3. Cleaning is great...and quiet! As mentioned above, it takes roughly 2 hours of runtime to clean my space and as I work from home noise was a concern. It's the quietest unit I've owned. It has 3 levels of power (eco, normal, and high), but I've only run it on normal. Inspection after the fact it sucked up all dust and pet hair I could see. The only places it misses are in my kitchen where my counters have a recess too small for it to fit under. The sweepers get about 1/3 underneath, but I have to hit these with a dust buster or broom if there's any visible debris. It is noisy when it auto empties the bin, but this takes maybe 5 seconds. I have mine programmed to empty every 30 minutes of runtime, but I think that maybe overkill. We have a dog and 2 kids, so maybe our house is a little messier than some, but the advertised 60 day capacity of the dust bin feels exaggerated as I've emptied it once a week so far and it's pretty full but maybe it can really pack dirt in tight. I'll try to leave it a bit longer and see how long before it notifies me to empty.
4. No-Go Zones. Within the app, you can set up block off spots you don't want the robot to clean. Why would one do that? Well...my robot got suck under my bed on a run. One side of the bed is just high enough for it to get under, but not the other.  First 2 runs it did fine but the third it got stuck trying to get out the low side and then confused by pillars under the bed. The good new is it called for help and put itself into hibernation. Again, great programming here. I've now marked that area off and it ignores it. 

So...is it worth the $450 I paid? Well...my Neato cost me around $250 in 2013 and current models run between $200 and $500. The last iRobot we bought was $450 back in 2020 and despite claiming to have ""smart mapping"" just ran around aimlessly, crashed into everything, and lasted less than 2 years. So far, the experience is far closer to my beloved Neato but with a super large bin due to the auto empty functionality. So while a bit of a splurge, certainly a much better experience than the iRobot I previous had. If it lasts, well worth it for me."
"Key Differences Between Shark RV2502AE and UR2500SR Robort Vaccum Cleaer 

https://preview.redd.it/fg1we9ucdt1b1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6a464fa394eb21d87ef4dc078cbdba0615eecee9

"First Robot Vacuum and Overwhelmed…Looking into getting my first robot vac, but I’m finding the process a bit overwhelming. Our primary concern is a completely automated experience (including cleaning/emptying)with great obstacle avoidance, something great with picking up pet hair (we have dogs and cats), and that can be efficient on carpet, hardwood flooring, and tile. So far the only device that seems to score very high for all of these is the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, but that price tag is scary. Does anybody have any other recommendations? Just feel a little hesitant as this is our first robot vacuum purchase."
"Shark AI Ultra - AV2511AE vs RV2502AEI cannot for the life of me figure out the difference between these two products and models. 

What I can tell so far is that [AV is white](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-AV2511AE-Self-Empty-Capacity-Navigation/dp/B09T4YZGQR), and [RV is black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J88GNW3). RV also has a HEPA filter and has 'CleanEdge'. But other than that, are these identical? Is one superior to the other? There is a $100 price difference between the two but I can't quite tell why, or which one is newer, or better, or anything really since they are so similar.

&#x200B;

I just bought the RV2502 from Bed, Bath and Beyond. The funny thing is that all the reviews on there are of the white robot, which should be the AV model... but the listing shows the black robot?"
iHome Nova replacement bags that work?I ordered some from Aliexpress they were dirt cheap like 30 bags for less than $10 and they look and feel like they'd work but my vacuum CONSTANTLY clogs now. Anyone know of a good replacement bag that I guess works? I suspect their is a issue pulling air through the bag surface in these cheap bags and not enough suction is created. The iHome branded bags are $14.99 for 3 which seems nuts to me.
"Neato D3: Bought a genuine new hi-capacity battery to replace the original one, but it won’t charge... what should I do? #help"
"Are Neato brand vacuums not really recommended anymore?Just curious as I don't see them brought up anymore. I just had my neato D3 connected finally die on me and switched to a Roomba i7+ and it left a lot to be desired. It doesn't clean nearly as well as my neato did and leaves dirt on the edges of the floors very often. The self emptying was nice, but the ""60 day capacity"" bag filled up in 3 weeks vacuuming 4 times per week. Wound up sending it back after the first 3.5 weeks and got a refund.

Black Friday sales seems like a good time to get a replacement and I see lots of recommendations for the Roomba j7 or roborock s7. Do these clean as well as the neato does? I probably have some bias as I have only ever had neato vacuums since the dawn of robot vacs and they have always cleaned well, but I want to branch out."

"Looking for Robot Vacuum recommendationsHi All,

I am looking for a good robot vacuum that doesn't burn a big hole in my pocket. A few details about my needs are -

**Home** \- 700 sq. ft. 1 Bedroom apartment in the US

**Flooring** \- Hardwood flooring in living room. Bedroom has a carpet

**Cleaning requirements** \- Mainly hair, dust, small food particles

**Price range -** $200-$300

What I am looking for -

1. Something that is fairly hands-off. I am not looking for anything too sophisticated as that would surely be expensive. But I am hoping that I don't have to intervene too much and get the robot out of difficult corners if they get stuck there
2. My hope is pretty simple. All rooms are rectangles and so is the furniture. The robot vacuum cleaner would need to go under the bed and under the couch though
3. The basic features obviously - Powerful vacuum, good capacity dust bag (I have absolutely no issues cleaning the dust bag)
4. My previous handheld vacuum required continuous cleaning of the brushes as hair and dust would get stuck there and cause them to jam. I don't know if thats avoidable but would be great to have
5. Some degree of integration with Alexa/Google so that I can voice control it. Not a deal breaker though

(4) and (5) aren't deal breakers so if I am getting a solid device for a good price which has all the basics then I am good with that.

Some options I found on Amazon. What are your thoughts? Thank you so much

Any other good devices that I did not consider?

"My experience: S9+ / M6 vs S5Max vs T8+I’ve been wanting to write up my experiences with these devices so far, but responded to a comment in Roomba about the S9+ and am pasting that instead. Would be happy to answer any specific questions:

I actually do have the i7 variant from Costco. As soon as it shipped the S9+ / M6 combo went on sale and jumped on it, but decided not to open the i7. Also have S5Max and T8 that I’ve been testing.

I haven’t had problems with S9+ others are having thankfully other than Roomba is less intelligent than the LIDAR technology based competitors. It takes a lot more effort to train but afterwards is mostly competent.

I will say It does clean much better, the self empty design is superior to T8, and is only one that can detect bin is full (it also has larger capacity bin than the others). IMO definitely the most sexy design. Also from an American company based in US with the best support.

On flip side is loud, takes much longer to clean than the LIDAR devices and doesn’t have real time cleaning progress like the LIDARS. It bumps into everything while training which takes 2+ runs to create the map. I joke that it’s gravitated to my subwoofer as it bumped into it constantly until I was able to create a no go zone.

The S5Max is well rounded with superior navigation. In my house you just set it and forget it. But questionable support, average cleaning and does not have auto empty.

T8 is best value for what I paid but S5Max has better navigation. The T8 often forgets how to get back to the base when I use it for mopping and self empty isn’t designed properly to empty when dander clumps up.

The S9+ is either the best and worst in every category. If price matters I’d recommend the T8 or S5Max. Even if it doesn’t you want to determine if S9+ is right for you. For a lot the i7 seems to be better.

I’m at the moment leaning towards keeping S9+ M6 (need more time with M6), but if a successor is announced anytime soon with LIDAR , I’d instantly exchange it for that.

Edit 1: background, I live in a 3 story, 3000 sqft house with dogs. Floors are hardwood with rugs in almost every room.  I don’t auto schedule as I have to pick up a few rooms in advance before I run the robot.  My goal is to run once a week. If I wait a week the T8 isn’t able to self empty as the dander becomes clumped.  The bin isn’t full but it’s an inefficient design to empty compared to room as. To avoid that I need it to run every 3 days-ish. 

I bought S5Max for $435 on Prime Day. T8 for $450 a week later at Beat Buy. i8 from Costco for $580 on BF and S9+ / M6 combo, both matching colors for $1150 from iRobot a few days later.  As mentioned I never opened the i8. 

I previously said if the T8 deal never came around I would have been perfectly happy with S5Max as it’s the best navigation in my house. My biggest complaint is the small collection bin. Otherwise it runs without much oversight needed.  This all started the giant rabbit hole where I am now. 

I also read the replacement parts for Roborock are hard to come by as they are intending these to be disposable (not sure if true). 

I really only need mopping in my kitchen as it’s connected to entries and my main bathroom with its tile floor."
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ecyszkgf381.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c3622533c2030046dbef7725b811ae4c8140468

 

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Shark AI Ultra (AV2501S) poor cleaning performance with pet hair (poor suction?)I recently got a Shark AI Ultra with the self-empty base. I've run the robot a couple of times now (always on the ""high"" setting or ""ultraclean""); it made a reasonable map of the house, seems to go in a nice pattern that does good coverage of the room...but it seems to leave quite a bit of pet hair behind, and if I check in the base station dustbin after a run, there isn't as much hair in it as I would expect. This is particularly the case for my living room rug (my home is all hard surface floors with a rug in the living room, and a couple of small rugs in front of doors).

As a test, yesterday I ran the Shark in my living room, and then ran my old Roborock S4\* in the same room and compared how much each robot had picked up, and was surprised at how much hair the Roborock got that the Shark must have left behind.

I'm wondering if there is any troubleshooting I can do or settings to check in the app before I come to the conclusion that the Shark AI just doesn't have the ability to pick up pet hair as well as the Roborock.

&#x200B;

\*I've been generally satisfied with the performance of the Roborock S4, and the main reason I got the Shark was the bagless self-empty base. I was hoping to just schedule the vacuum to do various rooms of the house and empty the base station's bin every couple days, instead of needing to the robot's bin after and sometimes during every run. When I returned our previous Shark IQ and got the Roborock, I had said that if Shark combined their bagless, self-empty base with a LIDAR robot I'd give it a shot."
"Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni - early review & initial thoughtsAfter the disappointing iRobot Roomba J7+, I had intended to go all out and get myself a Roborock S8 Pro Ultra. Unfortunately, getting one in the UK proved challenging. Amazon Germany say they will ship to the UK, but this turned into a bit of a nightmare.

Anyway, while I was stuck in the hellish void that is not owning a robot vacuum cleaner, like some kind of caveman, Ecovacs went and released the T20 Omni. It ticks all my boxes, on paper at-least, and for a change Amazon UK had stock and £300 off. So I thought I would give it a shot. Ecovacs is not a brand I have ever really considered much, partly because removing the pads to clean carpet (no longer an issue with this model) would have been a deal breaker for me. I haven’t been able to find a YouTube video or website review that isn’t basically a paid advert (many say they get sent them for free but the review is ‘their words’. Sure, but no one want to upset the companies that give them stuff to generate content with, anyway…). Even the Amazon listing had no reviews at the time of purchase, so maybe I’m mad, but for what it’s worth, here is my entirely unbiased initial thoughts after a solid day of testing. Hope it helps others considering this robot vacuum cleaner. 

Early impressions mostly good, maybe getting towards very good, but not ‘smashed it out of ballpark’ amazing. Yet anyway. It’s a lot more customisable than Roomba in terms of cleaning settings, so I’m still getting my head around what works best for my house and family, so as I say, these are first impressions and take that as you will. 

For a start, my Roomba J7+ just couldn’t get my golden retrievers hair off my low pile living room rug, at the most it just bunched it up into clumps so I could pick them up myself. No mater how many passes, or what I tried, it just didn’t have the power. Initially I was disappointed with the T20’s performance on the same rug, but after tweaking the settings for deeper clean, more passes and higher suction etc, the rug is now almost as clean as it is after a manual vac with my Dyson. So I’m very pleased about that, if it failed that test it was going back and I would have to go back the the drawing board for sourcing Roborock S8. 

It’s still a bit annoying how long it needs to achieve an acceptable clean of the rug, but as long as I’m not doing it my self I guess I don’t really care, it can do it when I sleep or I’m out at work or hiking. And my large-ish (by UK standards) house is mostly tile and oak wood floors, with a couple of low pile rugs. 

However, what I will say is that this is absolutely not a vac for people with mostly carpet, or even a lot of rugs and pets. If that’s your house, then don’t even entertain the thought of the T20, this isn’t the vacuum you are looking for. The settings required to achieve a just-about-acceptable carpet clean would kill the battery in minutes or take literally forever, if at all. Basically all you need to know is it’s next to useless on carpet, unless you have a very small amount you can hammer it with. 

Vacuuming wood, tile and slate floors seems more then sufficient, but what vac isn’t (unless you have deep crevices, which I don’t so can’t comment). The spinning mop pads work well, I prefer this approach to the pads most just drag around. Seems to actually clean, not just wipe. It also lifts them a good amount on carpet, no issues with wet rugs, which it does a great job of accurately detecting. 

The vac itself has no water tank built in. I’m not yet sure if this is a pro or a con. I can see this approach has a number of possible upsides (less to go wrong, more room for larger vacuum motors and batteries etc, less weight to carry around). The downside it has to keep going back to the dock to wash and wet the mopping pads (user configurable to 5, 10 or 15 minute intervals). The travel time and cleaning time adds considerable length to the cleaning, as it did this about 4 or 5 times. This could be an issue for some people, and may outweigh the benefits, especially if you wanted to mop every day. I plan once a week, so I’ll chose a day when the whole family are out all day and time is not an issue. 

Build quality seems decent, not quite as good as the Roomba in that respect, certainly not what I think it should be for the money, but yeah it’s fine, whatever. The dock is big but not quite as bad as I was expecting. Water tanks etc seem well made and easy to access and fill. Pad cleaning and drying works as advertised, but I will need much longer with it for a better idea. 

For those that haven’t used the Ecovacs app - it pretty meh. Not quite as user friendly as iRobot’s, but it has a lot more settings so it’s fair compromise. Not as good as Roborocks from what I have seen. But it gets the job done. I like the Apple shortcuts support, so I can create some home automation’s like not running and giving a warning when a door sensor detects a door it need access though is closed, more control over schedules, starting when the last person leaves the house etc. 

The battery seems to take forever to charge. But maybe the J7+ was smaller so it seemed quicker. I’m also perhaps being impatient with my new toy. I think it’s adequate though, unless you are planning to do a large house, including mopping and multiple passes. 

It’s probably not really fair to say much more at this point, without some more long term use. Straight out the box it did miss quite a few spots. It also simply refused to go a few places that even the stupid J7+ would, which just basically just blundered about, smashing into stuff and cleaning under my dining room table for example was a complete lottery. All my mid century furniture with its many narrow legs probably doesn’t help, but I was expecting a LiDAR based system to be a bit better at getting through stool legs and such like. It also didn’t get close enough to the walls quite frequently, leaving quite a bit of debris. Maybe the mapping will improve and there are a lot of settings that I think might help with it’s navigation, so I’ll see what changes and tweak can be made before making any definitive assessments. 

So it could be a keeper with a bit of work, but as I say, I need a few days with it. However so far it’s looking promising."
"New to mapping robots need help with schedule not performingHi... I just got an iLife t10s.  The map it drew was awesome and accurate upon first run. 

That's the good part.

I connected it to the Toya smart app first of course (how I see the map)

I ordered and named the rooms.

Then I went to timer (basically the add schedule thing) in settings.  Did so....and it wont run.  I've tried multiple times... setting different times, checking time zone of app location and all that and it doesn't want to start unless I start the ""auto clean"" button.  It works fine doing that but I'd like the automation of it working on days at certain times and such.

Any help would be appreciated.  It's pretty generic..like when you connect to the app you use the Wi-Fi robot vacuum connection.

Thank you for any thoughts here.

Update 3-10-2022

I worked with Customer support and they sent out a firmware update today.
Excellent customer service from iLife.

Great product...love this thing."
"Roborock S7 privacy and mopping performanceHi, 

This post is more of a reference for anyone who's searching for information on the S7 Roborock and is concerned about internet privacy/security and its mopping performance

This is **not a comprehensive review** and will **only focus on two things:** 

1. Performance without being connected to the internet ever (for those that have XL tinfoil hats like myself) 
2. Mopping performance

&#x200B;

**1. Performance despite never being connected to the internet: Great.** 

The good: 

* Easily controlled with the push buttons on the top
* Still maps the area and then vacuums in a grid pattern
* Auto detects whether it's on carpet or hard floor and changes the vacuum speed and deploys the mop
* Still returns to base to charge etc.
* Spot clean function is good for area cleaning.

The bad: 

* No idea what strength of vacuum it's on and can't change. 
* Can't change the water level of the mop either
* To do the spot clean  I have to pick the S7 up, put it in the affected area, and press the 'spot clean' rather than just telling it through an app. 

**2.  Mopping performance: poor**

The good:

* Auto detects hard floors

The bad:

* Without pre-wetting the mop it's pretty pathetic (may be related to not changing the setting in the app) 
* It doesn't raise the mop enough to not make the carpets slightly damp
* It doesn't do an amazing job of cleaning

&#x200B;

Overall: vacuum without internet connection is good, mopping is shit.   
**TLDR: If I was to buy again I would buy something with only a vacuum (maybe a J7 Roomba?)**"
"Proscenic M7 pro issueGreetings,

I wanted to share my experience with the Proscenic M7 Pro robotic vacuum with bin, which I have owned for approximately a year and a half. Up until now, I have had no issues with its performance as it worked flawlessly.

However, I have recently encountered a problem. During its regular cleaning cycle, the vacuum suddenly shuts off after only 3-4 minutes of operation. I have tried pressing the power button, but it does not respond, and when I check the app, it indicates that the device is offline. The only solution I have found is to manually transport the vacuum back to its charging station, which allows me to restart it.

I am curious to know if anyone else has encountered a similar problem. Could this be a battery-related issue? I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have.

Thank you in advance!"
Looks like Shark has changed the UI in the app slightly. It might be a coincidence but I've noticed better performance from my vacuum over the last week.
"Vacuum Bot recommendation student householdDear redditors,

can anyone recommend a budget friendly (<500€) vacuum bot? Maybe a model that has been working great in your own household.

We have a 65m^(2) appartment, no pets, girlfriend that tends to lose lots of long hair.

The following aspects are important:

\- reliable

(We thought about getting the Dreame L10s Pro for example but because of the mopping technology there seem to be lots of cases of mop or water tank malfunction, which doesn't make automation a lot of fun)

\- good vacuum performance

\- decent mopping would be neat, but I'd be ok if this is out of our price range

\- station is a nice to have but not necessary.

&#x200B;

Some of our candidates are w10 ,l10s pro, z10 all from dreame. But it doesn't have to be this specifiy brand.

Unfortunately right now the roborock s8 base model is cheaper than the s7 where i live, otherwise I'd go for a s7, but my girlfriend is not happy with the price tag.

&#x200B;

Thanks a ton in advance."
"Help Me Decide: Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni vs. Roborock S7 Maxv UltraHey there, I'm in the market for a robot vacuum and I'm trying to decide between the Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni and the Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra. The Ecovacs is currently on sale for $1640 AUD, while the Roborock is priced at $2499 AUD. I've heard that the Roborock is generally considered to be the better option, but I'm wondering if the price difference is really worth it.

As a first-time robot vacuum buyer, I'm curious to hear from others who have experience with these models. Have you used either of these vacuums before? If so, what do you think of their performance, features, and overall value? And for those who have tried both, do you think the Roborock is worth the extra $859? I'd love to hear any insights or recommendations you have!"
"Looking for upgrade inputI have \~2400 sq ft to vacuum, mostly tile and wood, in some cases with rugs over same. I've had an Ecovacs T8+ for a few years, and while it works, it has all kinds of issues: It's constantly getting stuck between chair legs or in some kind of corner, finding cables or drapes to chew on, losing it's map, the auto-empty frequently fails to empty the dustbin, etc.  I'm fed up with the amount of babysitting it needs.  Also, the mopping is frankly pretty sad. It mops after a fashion, but even with the pro attachment I'm not convinced it does much other than make the floor damp. 

While the T8+ is miles better than no robot at all, but I'd like to see something close the gap between the idea of a robot vacuum and the reality - something that I can count on to do its job reliably (preferably while having a good vacuum performance to noise ratio and preferably being effective at mopping)

Roborock seems to be reputed to have the best software, so the S7 MaxV Ultra and S8 Pro Ultra are interesting, but the prices are pretty obscene. These things are 4-5x more than I paid for my T8+, and it seems all too easy to imagine that they'll be multiples more expensive while maybe only being incrementally better than what I have now.

If their navigation is trouble-free, the mopping is effective, and they have the longevity/repairability to serve for \~10 years, then I can see them justifying their price tag, but I'm not sure that's where things are actually at today. 

Bottom line - looking for input as to whether any robot vacuum is smart enough to get through its cycle without needing a rescue and whether any of them have effective mopping. Although my interest is pointed in the Roborock direction, any input is appreciated."
"Shark RV1101 Will Not *Actually* ResetI’ve reset/power cycled everything - Shark, iPhone, AP, and UDMSE. 
I’ve opened the battery door on the Shark and unplugged it for about 15 min. 
I manually pressed the “Clean” button in the Shark and made it run until the battery died. 
I’ve removed my Shark from the app, then uninstalled/reinstalled the app. 
I’ve blocked/unblocked the MAC on my firewall
I’ve done all of this multiple times, for six hours yesterday. 

This started when I performed the (latest) factory reset on the app. Everything was “working” as in it was as crappy as usual, but even though Shark posts everywhere about how it continues to update and improve the map (LIIIES), that was not happening and it still, after 5 months of living in our new house, had not mapped the entire downstairs. 

The problem seems to be that the Shark retains my WiFi SSID/password no matter what. I don’t know how that’s physically possible if it has lost power, but as soon as I turn it on after a reset, the voice greeting is interrupted by the chime that means it’s connected to the internet and WiFi light comes on. The strange thing is that it doesn’t stay on, it blinks off and on. But not the fast blink you get when you hold the “Dock” and “Clean” buttons to initially connect - it’s a slow blink, on and off for ~5sec each. But when I look at it on my router, it shows the connection is stable with excellent signal. The problem is that I can’t remember whether or not it blinked like this when everything was working, but I am fairly confident the WiFi light was solid. 

If I proceed anyways the app says everything was successful, but I can’t control the robot with the app. Yet, if I press the physical “Clean” button, the app reflects that it’s cleaning, and all the normal options are available to me, but if I select one, let’s say I press “Pause”, the app shows that the robot is paused but the Shark ignores it and continues cleaning. If I kill the app and go back in, it shows cleaning again. Then, if I press the physical “Dock” button on the robot, the app shows it going to the dock. It shows the correct battery % and all that, so it seems there’s only one-way communication available - from the robot to the app, but not the other way around. 

I’m a network engineer and I am at a loss. The only thing I haven’t tried is changing the SSID password which might work, but I’ve also got 20 other devices on this 2.4GHz IoT network and I am not going to go around and re-connect everything just to get this POS working. 

I’ve seen one other similar post but not quite identical behavior. Is there a software bug or something right now? Does anyone know a secret way to wipe everything and start over? I’m about to take it apart and see if there’s a small battery on the motherboard for memory retention and remove that too but I don’t wanna spend another hour on this crap. 

I will never buy another Shark robot vac. This should be so simple, and they just cannot get it right. I could have cleaned my entire house 20 times over with the amount of time I’ve spent babysitting, troubleshooting, mapping, and resetting this thing. I’m about to throw it out the window."
"Roborock S7 or Dreametech D10 PlusI currently bought the Roborock S7 and I'm it's okay so far. I only need it for one floor as I live in a open concept house, with hardwood.

Currently I have a few problems with this vaccum. It's as if there is no obstacle avoidance. It bumps into everything fairly hard. Runs over wires. Pushes the docking station around. Runs into slippers and pushes them out of the way. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, but this doesnt feel like a premium vacuum bot. Also the mopping function, the mop doesn't get wet. Maybe I need to change settings.

Anyway, my question to you all is to know if the Dreamtech d10 Plus has much better performance? Or are they the same"

"Recommendations for robovacs without rollers for long hair?I've got long hair, like >1 foot long. My Roomba 670 tries to keep up like a champ, but every single moving part chokes on wound-up hairs pretty quickly, and I gotta cut it out like seatbelts in a car crash. I feel bad for the poor thing, and I wanna let it retire in peace, so I'm looking for a replacement:

\- I want to be able to perform maintenance by hand. Sliding hair off axles, for example. I don't want to keep pulling out scissors or a knife. I currently need to cut hair off both the brush and plastic rollers, side spinny brush, and all three wheels.

\- I only have hardwood -- no carpet.

\- I don't mind if I have to manually sweep up certain kinds of debris, as long as it can handle like, 80% of the dust bunnies and doesn't die doing so.

Based on what I've read here so far, it seems like I'm looking for something without roller brushes, but that they're harder to find lately? Anyone know some good places to start looking, or alternative solutions? Or do I just have tragically miscalibrated and unrealistic expectations?

Many thanks!"
"What to choose? Please help a robot newbie!Tl Dr - what is a good robot vacuum/mop hybrid, that:
is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"
"PSA on Neato Vacuums. Just Don’t! I bought a  D8 from bed bath and beyond, $200. It came brand new unopened, when i first went to clean the brushes it had the warranty sticker pre broken for me. 

It was working ok up until recently now it just gets stuck in loop where it drives a foot or two forward, starts up everything, ramps it down, and just repeats that. The app does nothing until you force reboot it. 

I’ve had robot vacuums before, i had the Electrolux Trilobite and that was miles better than this, even my S9+ is better. How did Neato mess up this badly???


PSA FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY A NEATO VACUUM. DONT! A crappy bumper robot for $80 will out perform these wastes of money. They’re so bad it feels like a scam. It’s in a wide open space and it does this."
"Best for vacuum only for medium pile carpet and multiple floors? Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, or Neato D9?Please help me pick my first robot vacuum. 

Multiple floors 1200sqft total, 1 cat, 1 human. I can speedrun vacuum my house in about 25-35 minutes, but that doesn't include stairs or multiple passes -- real ""deep"" vacuum cleaning time about 1.5 hours.  I'm looking for a way to reduce the amount of time down from 2-3 hours per week, while living in a cleaner house. 

First floor has hard floors with one area rug, second floor has mostly medium pile (.5in) carpet for bedrooms, but it's uniform cut (not berber style). 

 I have 1 senior cat that sheds some, but not excessively, but by the end of the week I can collect a decent amount of hair.  I'm looking mainly to pick up things like: crumbs in the kitchen, cat hair, litter, and general lint and dust.  No shoes upstairs, so I'm not worried about ground-in dirt in carpet. I'm also not too worried about pet mess, since I don't plan to run the vacuum when not home. It's more for after-work while I make dinner or fold laundry, or mornings when I go on a coffee run. 

Currently trying to decide between the Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, and Neato D9. Auto empty would be nice, but supporting multiple levels is a must.  Budget is about $500. I don't really need mopping, would rather have the best vacuum.

Roborock Q5+ pros: Lidar, good mapping, good app.  
Roomba j7+ pros: carpet performance, better build and support?  
Neato D9 pros: Lidar, better shape? edge cleaning? lower price.

Currently leaning towards the Roborock Q5. Any suggestions? Am I missing anything? Thanks!"
"Midea M7 pro front wheelHi all, got the vacuum on title and today the front wheel has started to get stuck while rolling, resulting in the vacuum not being able to move properly and performing some random movements, I've cleaned it from hair but i can see that while I'm rolling the wheel there is resistance at one place but can't understand why, there is nothing visible to cause the resistance. Any suggestions? Is it possible to remove the wheel? Tried but whiteout success and I'm afraid of damaging it."
The Yeedi vac - user opinions?I’m looking at getting the basic Yeedi vac. Buyers guide rates it highly for pet hair. Has anyone had experience with their performance versus other brands?
"Roborock S6 vs Mi Robot Vacuum Mop 2Hi, would like to get everyone's opinion on which one of this is a better buy and provide better functionality/performance."
"Roborock Q5 vs. Eufy X8 - they are the same price. Mostly bare floors.With various sales, both of these are about $320 right now.

The most important thing is performance on bare floors - lots of dust, dirt, and dog hair.

Thanks for the recommendation."

"High End Vac/Mop buy timingWith the patent coming to an end soon for iRobot's dual roller main brush, it looks like other OEMs are already posturing to copy it. For example, Roborock is expected to put out a model like it in April. Meanwhile I'm seriously considering an Ecovac Omni or a Roborock S7 Max Ultra. But I'd hate to spend for a premium product only for it to be completely outdated in 2 months. Does anyone have any data showing how much better the performance would be for a dual roller compared to a single roller bot? I probably should just be patient and wait for the new models."
Dreame L10 is the same as the Z10 without the base. (Look at the Specs) This is from Modern Castle. This a list of robots with Performance issues
"Bissell A3 is almost 1/2 off, I bought one here are my thoughts.As of right now the ready clean mop head changing system is just $350.The TLDR is; I am extremely impressed and, this will replace my Roomba M6 .

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"
"How does Samsung Samsung VR10F71 NaviBot (SR10F71UB) hold up against new models these days?Hi all,

a friend gave me his Samsung NaviBot since he does not use it anymore and after an initial test I was hooked. Little stuff left here and there but overall it was a pretty decent experience especially following that small adorable fellow with its cute little arms around while it was doing its job.

Now the actual question: How does it hold up against the modern versions of vacuum robots? Is it considered fully outdated and performing worse than even the entry level robots nowadays or is it a viable option considering it was not a cheap model back then?

I am pretty new to this area of technology and I would have guessed that a huge leap in performance happened since 2013 when the Navibot was initially released but I could not find any reliable information on this. Maybe you guys can help me in finding an answer to this question?

I appreciate any help. "
"Roborock S7 multiple floor performanceHi all,

I am looking for a robot to clean a 3-floor house. My plan was to carry the robot to the appropriate floor and let it do its thing. According to [Roborock's support page](https://support.roborock.com/hc/en-us/articles/900002181666-How-to-create-multiple-maps-for-multi-level-house-), S7 should be able to do that perfectly.

Could some Roborock owner confirm that this works as advertised? That after planning out all the floors, I just carry the robot to any floor and it does its thing? 

Also, is it a problem that the robot would loose WiFi connection on a certain floor?

Thank you for any help you can offer :)."
"Best alternative for Deebot N8 Pro+I have been using N8 Pro+ for last 5-6 days and thinking to return it because of some issues. The return to dock is horrible and custom/area cleaning is taking extra time by rotating in appropriate locations. What is best alternative for N8 pro plus? I will definitely need Vaccum, mop, self emptying and multi floor mapping. Budget is around 1000-1200 CAD."

"Ihome NovaI don't see the Ihome Nova listed anywhere here, so throwing my impression of it into the lists.  I had an earlier, top of the line, very expensive robotic vacuum, and gave it away after about a yr. due to poor performance.  The Ihome Nova is a top of the line robotic vacuum with a very reasonable price.  It does an excellent job, where it can reach.  I have a few pieces of furniture it can't get under, but no big deal, I get to it about once a week.  The Ihome Nova is set to vacuum early morning each day and I never have to worry about my floors.  If you have deep grouted tile, it does a fair job but is great on hardwood floors.  I have two large german shepherds who are in a year-round shed mode.  Since getting this vacuum, I can enjoy clean floors and my dogs.  It also has a wet-mopping mode; I haven't used it yet.  It is so easy to mop the floors when the hard work of getting the debris up is already done. So 5/5 stars in my opinion."
"Roborock q5 vs irobot i1/i4+I was hoping to find a good robot vacuum for my studio apartment. Most reviews and comments are for large houses. I'm trying to find a simple vacuum that makes my life convenient. I also have long hair and shed a lot which makes life so annoying.

Therefore good performance on carpet and ability to work good with hair is very important. Self emptying is also important but mopping is only good to have. Don't need fancy app features as long as I can use an app to set it to clean when I am not home but even that is super optional

Like to keep the cost minimum 💯 but ok to spend a little for no having to worry about maintenance. Also not having to buy special/expensive bags would be good.

"Debris stuck on brush instead go went into the bin Hi Guys, I have had a Morse Robo Vacuum for like almost 3 years. Working fine so far until recently, the Robo starts making weird things. All the dust, debris and hair that suck by the Robo was stuck on the brush instead of going inside the bin. This has caused me a lot of problems as I have to clear the brush more frequently than usual (twice a week). After performing a few tests like swapping the brush to a new one, cleaning the whole robot vacuum (including dissembling the machine), it looks like it was not fixing the issue. A 1 month of experiment was carried out to see how much dust was collected in the bin, and just like the title said all of the dust was stuck on the brushes instead of sucked into the bin. Could anyone please help me or suggest any solution?  
Thanks in advance!

"Doing research. Curious to hear some peoples opinions on the models I’ve looked at today.For starters, my house is primarily hardwood with some rugs here and there, and carpeted bedrooms. I own cats and The bedrooms are generally closed off, so if I am vacuuming them I will be explicitly initiating vs having a schedule. 

I initially was just planning on buying the Roomba S9+ and the Braava M6 for my hardwood floors. Then during my research found out the S9 and Braava can’t avoid objects like cat toys or puke. My wife is also pregnant so childrens toys will soon be joining that list of things the robot needs to avoid. I know the J7 exists and can avoid objects but that doesn’t fix the Braava mop not being able to avoid potential hazards.

I then discovered the Ecovac N8 Pro. All the reviews I’ve seen are incredibly positive. Has anyone used this? Does it work for you? How does it perform on real hardwood vs tile? I’ve always used special formulated hardwood floor cleaners and the idea of just using water is odd to me. Can I put a formulates cleaner in the Ecovac N8 Pro?

I was all set to go for the N8 and I saw a couple comments that complained about issues with the mop attachment causing the dock not to connect properly and complaint about having to remove the attachment to vacuum rugs and carpet.

So then I found the Ecovac X1 Omni and the Roborock S7 Max. Which both seem to have really good performance. But are also expensive enough that I will need to wait for a sale before ordering (which is fine I’m in no rush) my big question with these two is whether or not their performance is that much better than the N8 to be worth the price increase? 

It sounds like the roborock is easier because it can transition from hardwood mopping to vacuuming carpet with ease.But I’ve seen people say something about it not drying the mop attachment on the base, which I assume means I would need to get that attachment removed after it runs so I can clean/dry/replace it. 

So yeah. I’ve watched some YouTube reviews, read some online reviews. Now I want some Reddit real people reviews. I’d very much appreciate it if anyone who owns these robots can let me know their experiences and if they would buy them again."

"Looking for a Robot-vacuum/mop that does not mop on the carpetsI am looking for a robot vacuum cleaner that has also the mop function included and it's capable of recognizing carpets and not to mop on them. I am buying it to avoid cleaning every week, so I am looking for something with a very good cleaning performance. As a budget I would prefer to spend not more than 500 Euros. if it's cheaper, even better. I live in Germany."
"I bought a 360 S8 for my parents for Christmas - but the app appears to require a login, and I assume the app features (block/mop/etc zones) require the cloud servers and internet? What similar vacuums are *entirely* local and can't be semi/entirely bricked by a bust company, and have HA supportSo basically I bought the 360 S8 when it was on offer on Amazon for £230. Except I didn't realise (or think at the time since I left my shopping until a few days before Christmas...) that you need a login, and hence the features are also likely cloud based (correction would be lovely).

My parents have a *huge* home automation setup that I have designed for them (great test case for if I ever manage to buy my own home). Everything runs locally except for Google voice assistant (which connects through the Home Assistant integration). All the lights are Zigbee Hue (which doesn't require a login for the app or the internet for the hub/app to function, although they don't use the hub anymore but Zigbee2MQTT), battery sensors are Zigbee, WiFi devices are nearly all ESP based running ESPHome, they have a Home Assistant server, etc etc.

They were previously running a Roomba E5. So this should be quite the upgrade, I want something with the ability to have no-go zones (since the E5 always gets stuck and is dumb af), a mop, good flat floor performance (only two carpets, one very flat carpet, one quite shaggy, but both small), etc.

I bought the 360 S8 since it looked really good for the money. But now I'm quite pissed that I think it could essentially be semi or fully bricked if the company stops supporting it, or goes bust. I haven't tried to see if it at least vacuums and avoids zones already setup without the internet, since I put it straight back in the box after going onto app setup.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a replacement, with the same features. But that works entirely offline, ie it cannot be bricked in anyway, all features will work offline, including setting up new zones etc. And ideally something that has no-go zones.

I don't mind spending a bit more, but it can't be mountains more.

Or should I keep the S8 360. If they do kill it within 2 years I should at least be able to get a refund under consumer protections. And hopefully someone hacks the local protocol or something (hell if it does store all the data locally then I might hack it, it'd be a step up from my previous device hacking experience, but I think within reach if I have enough time to devout to it)."

"Swap S7 MaxV for L10/Z10? (support longevity, privacy)I picked up an S7 MaxV for a very good deal (about the same price as a Z10) with the bagless container. I’ve been extremely impressed with it coming from Eufy robots. I have no complaints about the product. 

Why am I considering switching then? Valetudo compatibility. 

Dreame/Valetudo: 

Pros: 
privacy. 
Longevity (I provide my own hosting so they can’t shut off function by killing their servers). 

Cons:
Probably a bit more expensive in the end due to getting the S7 very cheap. 
Time spend maintaining Home Assistant and Valetudo. 
No bag-less option. 
Possibly less performance?
Less polished app. 

Roborock: 
Pros: great performance. 
Polished app. 
Ready to go out of the box. 
Bagless. 

Cons:
Possible privacy issues.  
Server could be shut off and I’d be reduced to minimum features.  
I’ve been told there is no hope for Valetudo. 


Does Roborock have a history of supporting its products for many years? That’s probably my biggest concern, even more than privacy."
"Roborock S7 MaxV vs. Roomba J7 for human/pet hair?I’m currently deciding between the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra and the Roomba J7+. I really like the mopping and self clean ability of the Roborock, but every video I’ve seen has shown poor performance of hair pickup from carpet. The Roomba doesn’t have a good mopping kit, and the navigation is not as good as roborock’s, but the hair performance seems miles better on carpet.

I know of that several S7 owners have replaced the rubber roller brush with the Q5 brush, and that seemed to improve the carpet hair pickup performance. I was wondering if this would be comparable to the Roomba carpet performance after the Q5 brush change. Does anyone have insight into this?

Primarily concerned with my own hair (long) and two ragdolls cats who will be coming early next year. Ragdoll hair seems particularly long compared to the average cat. If I had no carpet I would definitely get the Roborock but as of now, I’m leaning towards the Roomba based on the carpet hair performance.

My apartment is around 900 sqft with 50/50 carpet and hardwood."
"How much does pa suction power matter?I'll make this quick! I'm between the Evovacs Deebot N8+ vs the Roborock Q7 Max. I have about 900-1000 square feet of floor between the 1st and 2nd floor, 70% of is it low carpet with the rest being wood/vinyl. I have a pitty with short hair. The Deebot has 2600 pa and the Roborock has 4200. Is that enough of a difference that I would see performance improvements? My main concern is wanting a robo vacuum that will keep the carpets clean and get dog hair and misc stuff out, I know most will do a fine job with hardwood.

They're within 100 bucks of each other on sale now, just trying to find a reason to pick one over the other. Or, do you have other suggestions in the price range?
Thanks!

Edit : I don't care about mopping, these just happen to have it."
"Dreame D9 vs D9 Max: what are the differences?Hey. I am undecided between these two models and, besides the suction power, I can't really see much difference.

"Best Robo vacuum for low pile carpet?Hello! We live in a 2 story house with the lower floor with hardwood and upper floor with a low pile carpet. We have a Roborock S6 MaxV that we regularly use in the lower hardwood floor. However, it does a OK job on carpets. Additionally, we have to take it up and down every time we clean. I am looking for the community's suggestion for a robo vacuum that is good with low pile carpet.

Requirements

* Brand not important (I really prefer Roborock since I have it and really satisfied with their performance but if there are better ones with other brands I am fine with it)
* Mapping is really important as we some times clean only certain rooms.
* Works well in low pile carpet.
* Our typical usage - scheduled cleaning every night / certain time in the day

Any suggestions from the community would be really welcome. Thank you!"

"Lydsto R1 with Autoempty Dock or Roborock S7 without?Hi,

I'd appreciate some advice from owners of either or both of these robot vacuums. I know they're not in the same league, AFAIK roborock is considered more 'top-class', however, I have a budget of about 500 EUR and I can buy either Roborock S7 without Auto Empty Dock, or Lydsto R1 that has AutoEmpty dock included by default (it's cheaper too, around 350 EUR versus 500 for Roborock).

&#x200B;

Some of my friends have Lydsto and they recommend it. However I've read a lot of reviews that say Lydsto's performance is a bit wonky, some people have issues with vacuum losing maps, some people were declined warranty repairs in Xiaomi centers (they were basically told that Lydsto isn't Xiami, despite the box saying it is, so they won't fix it), some got faulty LIdars, etc. Also, my wife doesn't like disposable bags, and Lydsto Dock uses disposable bags, which means buying a new pack every 6 months (what if they cease to be produced?).

I'm not sure Roborock is free from these issues, but being a higher priced unit I tend to think it will be more reliable.

Now... where was I..?

A question therefore is:

Do you think it's better to get a higher priced Roborock and hope it will be more reliable, despite not getting the AutoEmpty Dock; or should I just get a Lydsto, which is cheaper and has an Auto Empty Dock included? Is AutoEmpty Dock a big deal from convenience perspective?

I would greatly appreciate any insights. Thank you."
"EVOVACS Service and App ExperienceI just want to write about my experience in July 2022 with the ECOVACS company and their products. This is for anyone who may be looking to purchase a product in the future. 

I’ll start by saying I just purchased 2 robots from them, a T10+ and an X1 Omni. I understand these are both newer units and my experience will differ from those who have older robots. When researching which robots I wanted to purchase, I looked at A LOT of reviews and stories written by current owners. There was a common consensus that the service and app are both horrible and people should avoid both this company, and their products. Without making this too long, I want to say my experience has been the complete opposite. 

First off, the hardware is incredible and pushed me in the direction of these products regardless of the past stories I read. Coming from an iRobot product, just LIDAR alone made a huge difference, as my Roomba just runs into everything all day (often resulting in damaging itself). The Deebots both exceed my expectations when it comes to performance. 

The app was also not even close to as bad as I expected. Mapping went smoothly, I had no issue with creating rooms, and it is extremely easy to set a schedule / change cleaning settings. I do wish there was more guidance for certain features. An example of this is the air freshener on the T10+, as I was unable to find anything on how this works or if there is a setting without messaging support. 

Support has been just fine and exactly what I’d expect from a company. They were very quick to respond and never gave me any issue. You can tell they follow scripts, but most do and that is no issue. When I requested the new mop arms for my X1 Omni, in 2 days and 3 emails I had a tracking number with no issues. They just asked that I try a few settings first. Super easy. 

For anyone considering purchasing one of these products, I’d say they’ve come a long way from where they used to be and I really do recommend giving them a chance!

Edit: I did buy a 7 year warranty from Best Buy just in case"
"Shark AI XL Self-Empty (RV2502AE) ThoughtsI have not seen many reviews for the Shark AI XL but I picked one up anyway so want to share some thoughts on it. Hope this helps someone else looking to make the same purchase.

Mapping

The floor that the vacuum is on is just under 1500 sqft with some weird angles and room layouts. The vacuum took about 45 minutes to map the floor plan and it did a fantastic job, no complaints at all with the accuracy of the map.

Performance While Cleaning

The vacuum did a great job cleaning, it covered every part of the floor (the rooms are all carpeted so it was easy to see where it went). It couldn't complete the whole floor on one battery but not a big deal. It only got stuck once, in an area where I expected it to get stuck and the ""no go"" zones in the app took care of that.

Self-Empty Bin

This is a really nice feature to have and is the main reason I purchased this over some of the other vacuum options. We have a dog and the larger bin is a necessity. The bin also doesn't require a bag which is a plus. I have not had any issue with it completely emptying the onboard bin in the vacuum after each clean.

Noise

The few reviews I have seen on this vacuum say it's noisy. I guess I don't have another vacuum to compare it to, but it's not loud enough to be distracting while it's running.

App and Features

The app layout and experience is weird, but it works. One of the biggest disappointments with this app/vacuum is that I cannot set up and schedule cleanings by room. I work from home and the ability to clean certain parts before I start work for the day would be really nice.

Overall

With the mapping features and self-empty bin it's a great vacuum for the price. I was able to pick it up for just under $400 so it's hard to justify the jump to a Roomba or other vacuum. The scheduling limitations are annoying but, at this price, I think I'll live with it. Overall, it cleans the floor and doesn't get stuck every run like my five year old random path Shark vacuum does. That alone was worth the upgrade."
"Hardwood Floor Mopping on ECOVACS DEEBOT X1 OMNI vs Roborock S7 Max V UltraThere's been tons of articles and videos about the battle of the century between this year's two juggernauts, but one inconsistent aspect is their performance on hardwood floors. I've seen some say X1 Omni is superior for hardwood floors thanks to spinning brushes, while others said it underperformed compared to Roborock's sonic vibration. I only have hardwood floor so I can overlook X1 Omni's biggest flaw, but I still can't tell its hardwood floor performance after spending so much time reading reviews and comparisons because they say different things on this subject.

Also, have the issues with the Omni's AI and maps disappearing been mostly fixed with firmware updates?"

"The Shark Robot Vacuum is blowing air on the sideWhile it's not the most advanced version of the Shark robot vacuum and probably a few years old, I noticed that the  robot vacuum as it goes all over, anything beside it blows it away , especially cat hair.   It doesn't make any sense to me why would it blow air out on the side, It'll never pick up the hair, since every time it passes by the hair just gets blown aside again.

It picks up stuff (although seem like a very weak suction) it rolls over, but not on the sides, where it hasn't gone over yet.  It's not heavily used and I cleaned it the best I can , but the problem remains.   The reason of low usage due to its extremely poor performance.  It's one of those $250 types, no wifi or smartphone app or anything for this model.  My wife sort of given up on this thing and wrote it down as a waste of money and I figured if there is something I can do to make it better, unless it's just a poor design. "
"Recommendation for carpet cleaning robot vacuum?Hey guys, I hope this is the right sub for my questions. I'd like some recommendations for a good carpet cleaning robot. Here are some of my requirements and needs.

So I have [these carpets](https://imgur.com/a/TloU2cA) in my home, and the floors are mostly covered with this kind of carpet. I have very little ""naked"" floor, and I do not plan on buying deeper carpets, so it will be mostly of this kind.  
That's why I don't really care much about hard floor vacuum performance.  
I also don't have pets, don't walk with shoes on inside, and I mostly need good performance for picking up dust/dead skin from the carpets and the hard floors here and there. I live in the city, so the dust is constant and plentiful.

About mopping, I haven't decided if I need it. Maybe it would be nice if it could mop the hard floors here and there, but I never really stain them with something. If it would help with the dust cleaning, then let's have it.

The Roombas look good for my needs, but to me they seem like they are falling behind on some of the technologies and innovations, and I'd really love to have the newest technologies. For example I'd like to have the Roborock's feature of being able to view the camera feed at all times, and even navigate the robot yourself. It's almost like a security system.

P.S. Bonus points if the robot is taller, rather than wider, as it would be easier for it to go under some of the kitchen chairs and in some corners."
"Buying advice? Obstacle avoidance, lidar, good on carpetsMy Neato D3 has fallen victim to their planned obsolescence scheme and cannot clean my whole house without intervention. I had been hoping to get it to the point where the technology was better, but here we are. I am not giving Neato another dime. 

My budget is around 400USD. My priorities are LIDAR so it can run at night and obstacle avoidance. I would love a self empty base but only if it is bagless or bag-reusable. Mopping will not be used as 90% of my place is carpet.

Things I am considering:

* Dreame L10 Pro or a Z10 if it is better at obstacles or performance. 
* A Neabot Q11. This seems to tick the boxes but what little info there is about it is mixed. 
* Importing a Xiaomi from AliExpress
* Accept worse obstacle avoidance and get a Shark

A lot of the vacuums I see are still from 2021. What is the usual release pattern on this stuff? If I suck it up with the D3 for another month or two is it likely that something that hits my big three requirements comes out?

Thanks!"
"i3+/m6 vs roborock s7I want to ask for your advice about the two options I mentioned in the title. 
I have a black Labrador, so lots of hair. My house is two stories. First floor is all hardwood. Second is mostly carpet. The current setup that I have is a roomba i3 with the self empty base and a Braava m6. The roomba gets my floors clean. I run it everyday (only downstairs). The Braava can only clean like a third of the floor before the pads gets too dirty. But it’s enough for the highest traffic areas (long halfway and kitchen bar). I bought both used for $300 total, plus I spent around an extra $50 to get new replacement parts. 
Wanting a better option I purchased a roborock s7 during prime day (for $430). Since my budget is tight I got the basic robot without any base and my plan is to sell the iRobot set to cover most of the cost. But now I’m wondering if the roborock will be really an improvement, considering I won’t have the self emptying base. I haven’t open it yet. My motivations to get it were: 
-having more than one map so I can use it upstairs (cleaning different rooms different days of the week) 
-having mopping and vacuuming at the same time (and therefore being quicker) 
-vibrating mop, hoping to get better cleanin
-quieter machine (nice to have) 
-getting newer technology, and being new hoping to last longer.  
Is the roborock upgrade worth it even if I don’t have the base? I don’t think I would get is soon. The roomba has been such a lifesaver getting rid of all the hair and crumbs and other stuff (have a toddler). The Braava I don’t run it that often. Maybe because I have to set up the pad. I used to prefer the set and forget approach and I think the self empty base made it so easy to run the roomba everyday that I’m now convinced a robot is a great investment. But I also have noticed that the roomba does requiere attention (cleaning brushes, filter, etc) so I know I’m willing to put some effort."
"I work with sensors with my job. People need to understand the limitations of what's available today for the consumer market.Robot vacuums are some of the most advanced consumer products there are.

"Best robot vacuum and mop with self empty for hardwood floors and pet hairHello Robot Vacuum and Mop Gurus,

I am looking to buy our first robot vacuum and mop for our 2 level approximately 2000 sq foot house- we are looking to move to about a 3000-3300 square foot house(when we are able to find one in this crazy housing market) so would want to get a vac and mop that is able to handle at least that amount of space- mostly hardwood floor and tile in bathrooms and kitchen with some area rugs. We have a 7 month old Labrador retriever puppy so need the vacuum
to be able to clean pet hair. 

I have read ratings and reviews  on several
Websites - tomsguide, pcmag, rtings, wirecutter, realsimple, usatoday, goodhousekeeping, nymag, vacuum wars on youtube, etc. and they all recommend different products with some overlap. I did review a few posts on this and other reddit forums as well but would like to know what the end users like now. I am still very confused and would really appreciate your input based on your personal experiences and knowledge. Is it true that some sites are driven to push certain products more by sponsorships from their manufacturers than by actual product performance?

I went ahead and ordered the roborock s7(for $450 from amazon) the roborock e4( for $220 from amazon) - both without the auto empty bin - and the deebot t8 aivi with the auto empty bin  (for $599 from Costco) so I wouldn’t miss out on the holiday sales- though I am still not sure which one of these would best suit my purpose. I got the e4 based on the review on rtings.com, the t8 aivi based on vacuum wars and pcmag and the s7 based on pcmag’s review - probably listed elsewhere as well. 

Please recommend the best/a fairly good and reliable combined robot vacuum and mop with an auto empty bin that is available in the market today. I am located in the US and am able to return all of the 3 vacuums that I bought if theres a different one that you believe performs better. I am willing to spend upto $600 max  $750 if it really makes sense in terms of what the product delivers as compared to a cheaper one out there. 

Is the technology still evolving or are there products out there which consistently clean well and require minimal maintenance and upkeep? Based on what i have read, I don’t believe  any robot vacuum is able to completely replace a regular corded vacuum entirely but is definitely helpful as a secondary cleaning tool with a regular vac being needed to be used every couple of weeks or so- is that your experience as well?

Thank you so much and have a nice weekend."
"no pets, kids, or carpet, is the deebot T8 overkill for me?I currently have a 1200 sqft home (1floor) with all vinyl wood flooring, only some small accent rugs. I don't have  pets or kids. (Will have kids in about 2-3 years) 

I'm looking to get a vaccum on bestbuy.com and I've heard lots of good about the deebot T8, but would that be overkill for me? The $700 price tag after tax seems kind of steep.

I think my biggest ""requirement"" is that the robot actually maps my house so it vaccums all the floor thouroughly,  doesn't do ""random"" vacuuming. 

Mopping isn't a requirement. I would REALLY LIKE for it to have auto empty bin but it's also not a requirement. Any advice?"

"New home, new vacuumHi there! 
I’m looking for recommendations on a robot for our new home. I do have two cordless ones (dyson and shark) but want something to run daily to keep the floors cleaner so I don’t have to manually vacuum the entire house daily. 

About the house:
2000sqft, 1 floor. Tile everywhere except the 3 bedrooms. I mostly want the robot for the tile, but carpet performance is a plus. One very messy little boy and a non-shedding dog. One constantly shedding human (me 😂)
I also work with acrylic powder daily, so there’s lots of dust 

Wants:
/Mapping with a good app and Alexa integration. Would like to be able to set up zones if that’s possible 
-needs to avoid objects and liquids. Pet waste isn’t an issue but little boy spills are!
-self emptying bin
-low profile? I guess? I had a very cheap one several years ago and it always got stuck under couches and couldn’t make it back to the base

Budget $700 or less if possible. Might stretch for something that ticks every box"
"I see a lot of questions about Dreame z10 vs Ecovac N8/T8: Here are my thoughts and impressionsI thought I would share my experience with both the Z10 and the T8+ 

I watched all the YTbers I could find (Is Mr. Roboto, Dreame sponsored?). If you watch Adams tech reviews or Cordless vacuum reviews on YT, they had a very different experience with the Z10.

Anyone with affiliate links I dismissed as having an agenda or vested interest along with anyone hosting a fan page.

(BTW, European and Asian reviewers do a better job)

Anyways here is what I found from personal use.

I have had the S6maxV, the z10, and the t8+ OR bots. 

The OR (object recognition) on the s6maxV is the best of the three but not by much, the T8 is 2nd and z10 3rd, but both are close.

The Z10 bin is better than Ecovacs and does not have the hair clog issues that the t8/n8 has, but that is a pretty easy DIY fix. It is not perfect but makes the system usable.
 
Cleaning performance is HANDS down better with the t8+ not even close. The T8 is the best CARPET cleaner I have tried. (I tried the Roborock s4max, s6maxv, 360 S5, 360 s9) The 360 s9 is close, but the brush can stall once in a while. This is the closest to the T8 cleaning carpet and hard floor. The s9 has ok OR but no bin, so I use it to clean one carpeted room on a schedule. 

The z10 has issues with the carpet sensor; it does not always work for carpet boost; it's OR will avoid items it shouldn't, like bath mats, avoiding the whole room, has a lot of blind spots, the T8 does the same but not as often. 

The Z10 can create ghost rooms, but the app is MI home, with good basic functions. But they are using some else's tech and just branding it, so not much customization; it can be temperamental with room edits, no automation options like Alexa voice commands, which for me is a must.

It is soooo loud 😮 ❕

The next point is HUGE 

Dreame has NO US repair facilities, so all repairs must be sent to CN, which means they push back on warranty issues and have no support. It's taken weeks for a reply via email. 

No supply chain for consumables 

Ecovac is better on all points

The t8 is not perfect. The app is temperamental and has a learning curve, 

(The Facebook group helps ALOT)

Pro tip

For example, room scheduling must be done in area mode, not auto mode, to combat changes to the map environment like closed doors. 

If you use area mode when cleaning, then when a door is closed on a run, the map will update. When it's open on the next run, it will update.

Next pro tip

It would be best if you cleaned on a schedule to help the bin. You NEED to do a hardware hack on the bin to fix clogs if you have pets.

I can share the hack I google it.

The process for using multi maps is precise (you have to watch the videos)  

It tangles hair on the brush. They use softer brushes to limit stalls. The other CN companies were built for European and Asian markets where rugs and hard floors are more prevalent in the US. We have carpet and ecovac, and Irobot built robots optimized for the USA.

Also, RoboRock, Dreame, Neabot, etc.. are trying to understand the US market, retail in the US does not provide tech support as they do in Asia, but they have not built out those support modalities. 

I can share more, but the Z10 has it of issues. 

My #1 priority is cleaning, and the z10 does not do this well, Mr. Roboto used it on low pile carpet, and his house is all hard floors. Check out every other reviewer who did accurate carpet tests. Z10 does not perform well.

The Z10 and the L10 are the same robots; the guy running the Reddit group is giving wrong info and is an affiliate, so his information is suspect.

I don't have a dog in this fight.

I am considering going to the J7 if I find the carpet cleaning is equal to the T8; I also am curious to see what the new RoboRock all-in-one looks like.

My set up
T8 to clean the main floor three carpeted bedrooms, laminate hallways, kitchen, entry, and breakfast nook (use t8 multi map for the carpeted living room) robot runs six days a week daily for carpets, 5x per week for laminated floors.

360 s9 daily for carpeted family room (looking to switch to I3plus or Honiture Q6 for AEB)

Debot n79 daily in the garage 

M6 for laminate floors 5x per week.

PS do not be afraid to buy used esp irobot, a lot of ppl buy or get these robots, don't know how to use them get rid of them. You can get a great deal. Robots are modular, so they are easy to fix. Brand name brands can be repaired, but low-volume brands are disposable. 

The Horniture I bought new for $150, the i13+ used for $125"

"Looking to upgradeI have a Roomba 614 that is slowly dying. It's functional for now, but I'm preparing to upgrade soon. My price range is about $600, preferably a device that I can get at best buy (gift cards). I have long haired dogs, so performance with pet hair is extremely important. No go zones would be nice, but not a deal breaker.

I've been looking at the Roomba i3+ or the Shark AI. Any others that might be a good option?"
"Deciding between Deebot N8 Pro+, Neabot N2 or Roborock S7+ for a medium heavily carpeted houseMy house is a multi-level house with each floor being about 500ft^2 (50m^2 ish) and is mostly carpeted. On the bottom floor, the kitchen and bathroom is hardwood but it's <15% of the area, whereas the upper floor it's only the bathrooms. 

I want something that meets the following requirements:

1.  Uses LIDAR. I don't trust iRobot's privacy with cameras
2. Has no-go zones
3. Has an auto-emptying bin
4. Works great on carpet and hardwood for vacuuming.

I don't care about mopping at all. 

So I've narrowed it down to the ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+, the Neabot N2  or the Roborock S7+.

I'm having a hard time deciding between the three. The S7+ seems the best but it is nearly $1000. The reviews for Ecovacs on Amazon make it seem like it's better for hardwood. Neabot seems to have great reviews and is significantly cheaper, but it is also a brand new company and I'm not sure how it will perform in the long run."
"A Critical Review of Popular Vacuum Robot Brands**1. iRobot Roombas**

Roombas are some of the most Reliable overpriced vacuums with a stable and feature-rich app. They don't have LiDARs yet. They don't have the best navigation or object avoidance, and yet they just work.

They are some of the best-rated vacuums out there. That, however, doesn't change the fact that they are highly overpriced for not being even half as smart as most competitors.

**2. Ecovacs Deebots**

Ecovacs has an impressive range of products but only on paper. The buggy room mapping overlaps walls, misinterprets closed doors as walls, forgets room labels every single time. This makes their products totally useless which is really sad as the vacuums by themselves are impressive.

Most issues they have can be fixed with a software update. Sadly, the team hasn't been able to fix any. They'd rather spend their budget on marketing and hiring as many influencers as they can to recommend their products. I'm sure you'll witness that live in the comments section.

**3. 360 Robots**

360 has the best navigation and mapping in the market programmed by a team specialized in building driverless cars. Also, they have the laziest implementation of an Alexa Skill. You can only turn the vacuum on and off using Alexa after which you'll have to open the app anyway.

360 vacuums give you the most value for your money. However, many users have reported that these vacuums need to connect to a server in China. The vacuum is just a piece of plastic if that server is down, which is the case most of the time.

**4. Roborocks**

Roborocks are the only ones on the list that offer convenience by not trading your cleaning problem with a technical one. They are great at mapping rooms, navigating efficiently, and avoiding objects. The app is stable and has all the necessary features. The only downside is the availability of after-sales support based on your country.

**Conclusion:** While we are busy admiring technical specifications, most of us tend to forget that technology is intended to make our lives easier. In the initial phases of anything new, the work reduced is just replaced by the additional effort of dealing with the technical challenges of the product.

So far, the vacuum robot market can be summarized as follows:

**1. Vacuums that have nailed the basics of cleaning but can't deal with tricky situations:** Like the Roombas that might need your help every now and then to move the furniture around

**2. Vacuums that have mastered the tricky situations but can't get the basics right:** Like the Ecovacs with their buggy mapping and app.

**3. Vacuums that have nailed everything but turned their product into total garbage by adding a dependency over a remote server to perform basic cleaning:** Like the 360s

**4. Vacuums that are just perfect with almost everything you need but you can't buy them fearing the lack of after-sales support:** Like the Roborocks"
"Ecovacs DEEBOT OZMO T8+ is on sale at Best Buy in the USA for $449.99 ($300 price reduction)[Here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecovacs-robotics-deebot-t8-vacuum-mop-robot-with-advanced-laser-mapping-and-3d-obstacle-detection-avoidance-grey/6423195.p?skuId=6423195) is the link to the listing on the US site for Best Buy. Regular price is $749.99. It's the T8+ - the + just means it comes with the self-emptying bin. This is **not** the AIVI version with the front camera, but I have seen more favorable reviews for this version, anecdotally.

I have heard this is a common sale, but it may be a couple months before it goes on sale once this offer is over.

The N8+ (not the Pro version) is available for $499.99 from $599.99 at Best Buy as well. However, the N8 Pro+ is available on Amazon for $594.99 from $799.99, if that's to your liking instead. It's to be noted that the [OZMO Pro Mopping](https://www.amazon.com/Ecovacs-Mopping-Scrubbing-Feature-Accessory/dp/B08GH3N618/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=deebot+n8&qid=1627064335&sr=8-10) add-on is only compatible with the T8 and the T8 AIVI

&#x200B;

Overall, I have seen mixed reviews for Ecovacs including some that say the company will offer you a $100 Amazon gift card to remove a negative review, which could mean that the reviews that *are* present artificially skew positive. VacuumWars on YouTube loved the T8 AIVI and the N8 Pro and claims to not be sponsored by Ecovacs and purchased the vacs out of pocket, but some are either suspicious of this claim or outright contend it.

In my limited research, people have a lot of strong feelings about Ecovacs one way or another, and it's hard to verify the integrity of reviews that are openly sponsored, of which there are many. Some are wary of the quality of the devices due to allegedly lower manufacturing standards in China where Ecovacs is based and there are concerns over the longevity of the devices since the company is relatively young. Many complain about the quality and reliability of the app and have issues with the self-emptying bin clogging.

That being said, a lot of this is true or there is some analog for all the robot vacuum companies I have researched recently. Issues with performance, issues with veracity of reviews, lack of features or misalignment between needs of the user and the features offered by the device, quality of manufacturing, and value for money. It seems there is no perfect robot vacuum. Some decry the very notion and suggest you'd do better to get a bagged, corded Miele from 1985 off of eBay and enjoy a feat of German engineering whenever you clean your house.

In the end, I took advantage of this deal today and purchased the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8+ from Best Buy as my first ever robot vacuum. It seems worth at least trying at that price point for what is a competing top-line robovac (by some estimates) with a mopping feature. I also opted to pick up the OZMO Pro Mopping add-on from Amazon. Not on sale, but still come out around the same as I would for the N8 Pro+ at the current sale and it can't handle the mopping upgrade.

I can't speak to anyone else's needs, but me getting a fancy manual vacuum instead of a robot will result in a new stationary friend for my current vacuum that remains so very rarely used. I work from home, have a kid, another on the way, and if this little critter will give me one less thing to worry about, even if it's imperfect, it's worth the risk/investment."
"Looking for a Robot with the following characteristics, I'm a bit lost.Hello, I'd like to replace my old, ""dumb"" Roomba with a better performing robot vacuum with some smart features.

What I would really like to have is:

- Mapping: I have a single floor apartment and would like to just map it all and let the robot go wild while I'm not home

- No-clean zones: I have a couple areas like the cat's food/water bowl where I'd like the robot not to go and accidentally spill over water.

- Obstacle detection feature: I'm mostly worried about stuff like cables and socks getting wrapped around the brushes and clogging the robot while I scheduled a cleaning and I'm not home, is there a robot that can detect these sort of ""small"" items and recognize it's not dirt?

- Select mopping/non-mopping areas: I got a couple of carpets I'd rather not have mopped :D

It'd also be nice to have an auto-empty system but not really necessary.

Also, last thing: It should be available in europe as I'm not from the US idk if that's a discriminant or you can pretty much find all models anywhere.

Thanks for your help"
"Bought the i8+ and new IQ #UR1100S1US from costco.So one of them is going to need to go back.  We got the shark first and it was pretty cool, but it seems to struggle with dog hair on the carpets.  Still it would come back to the dock and dump a bunch of hair.  It got plugged on the second cleaning though.  It seems to get stuck or lost sometimes but seems pretty smart when working around most obsticles.

I later read the i8+ is better on carpet so we though why not try it out.  The I8+ is still learning the house, but the map seems better.  The battery lasts longer too so less pausing between cleanings.  It does seem to clean our carpet better, but it still mostly just leaves clumps of fur.

I prefer the dock and the bin on the shark.  The dock is smaller and the base does not stick out because the robot backs in to dump.  It is also bagless which is a much better design for me since I will be dumping these frequently (probably every other day).

**Shark IQ UR1100** \- This is the model with the floor tracking sensor. Seems to map the house pretty quickly, maybe even more quickly than the I8+, but also seems less acurate.  Still it woke up this morning and did most of the house.  However after charing up and coming back to finish the job, I had a error that the dust bin was not installed, Just took it out and put it back in.  Then an hour later the lip on the front was hung up on a scale in the bathroom and it was stuck between the scale and the shower floor mat and it drained the battery, and I had to put it back on the dock (it tried to find it but got lost in a bedroom).  After 3 days of usage the brushes on the bottom (not the roller or spinners) already look trashed, especially on the part that holds the roller in place, not a good sign on something that is not a week old.

**The i8+** likes to bump into more stuff, or at least thats how it seems so far.  After using it one time it has already scuffed up the whole front panel running into stuff. It does do better on the carpet (although it still leaves clumps of hair) and the map in the app looks a little more accurate than the shark (it is still learning).  The roller design is superior and works better on carpet (maybe a little better on the hard floor but not enough to pick one over the other for me).  The dock is bulky because it sticks out so far, and I hate that you have to buy bags for it.

We may be replacing the rest of the carpet with a hard floor soon, so I don't know how important the carpet performance is, it's likely we will always have a rug or something.  So far the i8+ has found its way back to the dock every time, even if I moved it.

Trying to decide which one to keep, or maybe neither.  I keep reading horror stories about robots smearing poop on the floor.  Now our dogs are trained but they have had accidents / gotten sick and I'm wondering if I need to wait for costco to carry a robot that can detect this stuff?

&#x200B;

Oh yea, the I8+ is significantly noisier than the shark on the LVP floors, contrary to most reviews I have read."
"Trying to decide between Deebot and RoborockI've researched a bunch of stuff, and have a few choices left on what I want to buy.
Either the Roborock S7 or Deebot T8 AIVI. I read through some of the posts on here, but they didn't answer my questions. My main concern is carpet performance (low pile) and object avoidance. I have kids and my old roomba 670 will just eat their toys and cords. I also have a large dog, and the roomba gets tangled with hair very quickly. Thanks a bunch in advance!"
"Looking for a bot to adoptHi everyone,

Been looking before posting and didn't see anything related to this.

We  have a good duo of Roombas at work and they do a great job (vet clinic,  7 women, I let you imagine the amount of hair and dust they have to  deal with). Really pumped up by Bob & Ike (our roombas) and their  performance,  I'm looking forward into buying a vaccum robot friend to  help me keep the house clean.

Only  problem so far : I have a big ass sofa on relatively short feet : 8,5cm  (3,35in). I would have loved to adopt a Roomba, but they are all around  9,5cm (3,74in).  I've seen some models that are ""ultra slim"" with 5,5  to 8cm (2,17 - 3,14 inches), but often some obscure brands on Amazon  (and i'm not so open with the idea of my data being stored in an unknown  company's servers).

They also  tend to all have a wet cleaning feature (which I really don't need imo),  not sure if it's bullshit, if it only takes out dust, or if it really  cleans the floor well. What's your opinion on this ? If it works, any  pet-friendly detergent I can put in it ?

So my dream bot would be :

\- With an app **and secured/trusted servers** / Without an app but with a remote (no random-only mode, I don't want my bot to act like an old blind & deaf Dachshund).- From a trusted/reliable brand- 8cm (3,14in) tall or under (the hardest part)- With central rotative extractor (one or two brushes), as I don't really trust the simple vaccuming hole- Able to handle pet hairs (3 short haired cats)- (Optional)  with two lateral brushes- (Optional) with a square front end for corners

I know I'm asking a lot, but what would you recommend me with those criteria ?

(Done a lot for research too and only found the Deebot Ozmo Slim10 to answer to my wishes but at 850€ it's WAY above my budget)

Thanks to everyone who read this, best wishes to everyone for the upcoming year."
"iRobot M Series Mop Coverage QuestionHello all - 

I have been performing cleaning runs with my new M series mop and am finding that the coverage is sorely lacking, especially compared to the iRobot i8 vacuum I have. 

The mapping the M series mop initially did was awesome, and extremely accurate of the room, so I figured the cleaning would follow suit. What I am seeing is it is skipping a good portion of the room. 

I have tried all 3 settings on the mop to try and improve the coverage with no luck. I am curious what others have done to improve coverage of the mop? Or if others are even seeing this? Thanks in advance for any help.

"Does a Scoopa replacement robot exist?I've had 3 second-hand Scoobas (380/390) that serve greaty to the mission of keeping our floor clean. I don't regreat buying them, but each lasted only few months. After repairing and replacing several parts they get back to life for few months and then another part needs fixing/replacement.

I guess that evidences why iRobot decided to stop selling them, and I can see how difficult can be to build cleanin robots that mix hydraulics, electronics, pumps, etc.

I also gave a try to several mops (Braava, attached mops to vacuum cleaners, etc) which I don't think are worth. They serve their purpose to do superficial cleaning, but nothing compared to the work that the Scooba perform.

Do you think there is a real candidate that can compete with the old Scoobas? I've seen a similar product( iLife W400) which doesn't get much publicity, and my feeling is that the new iRobot mops wouldn't perform much better than the old Braavas (came from Mint)"
"Roborock S7+ vs. Dreametech Z10 ProTL;DR Which auto-emptying robot vacuum cleans low/medium-pile carpet the best, handles long-ish hair decently, has a mop that’s not terrible, and has software that won’t require multiple re-mappings?


Hi all, another request for the “best” robot vacuum/mop. I recently purchased the Ecovacs Deebot N8 Pro+, but I’m not too happy with its buggy mapping issues. So I’m looking to replace it with one that cleans well and has better software.

I’ve seen some reviews about both the Roborock S7+ and the Dreametech Z10 Pro, but I haven’t seen much that directly compares the two – would anyone happen to have any insight there? I have both carpet and tile. A good mop would be nice, but I understand that stuck-on stains would require more work than dragging a wet microfiber cloth across the floor, even if it vibrates. I don’t mind if I just need to run a second round of mopping, though. That said, I think better carpet cleaning is somewhat more important to me.

Cleaning tests I’ve found online have somewhat conflicting results. For example, the individual reviews from BestCordlessVacuumGuide indicate that the S7 cleans marginally better than the Z10 Pro in all its tests except in “deep cleaning” where the Z10 Pro performed just a little better, but generally that site shows the two cleaned pretty similarly overall.

On the other hand, ModernCastle tests show the Z10 Pro performing significantly worse than the S7. I don’t know how reputable/thorough either of these sites are, so it’s hard to discern if the S7’s higher price point is really worth it. I know that VacuumWars recommends the S7+ but I haven’t seen a review there for the Z10 Pro. Feels like I’ve been going in circles for a while, so I’d greatly appreciate any help!

"Robot Vacuum reviewI have had three robotic vacuums so far and here is where I stand on them. 

The first one I bought over a year ago was the Roborock s6+ which was their flagship model at the time. The navigation was amazing and that vacuum never got stuck. However, I soon found out that the main roller brush did not work on medium pile carpet and there was no information at the time of an update to fix it. Of the three robot vacuums I had this one by far had the greatest app. I returned that vacuum because about 60% of my home is carpet. 

Next up I bought the Deebot T8+ shortly after returning the Roborock. Again, the navigation was wonderful, and it had all the features of the Roborock plus an auto empty bin. I had this vacuum for a year. My only complaint was it did not deep clean carpet as much as I would like, and I had to use an upright vacuum every 2-3 weeks on top of running the Deebot 2-3 times a week to keep the carpet clean.  After having it for a year, its main motor gave out on me and broke down. Costumer service was less than helpful and would not send a replacement and wanted me to pay to fix it. I was able to sell if for parts and get a few hundred dollars out of it. 

The last vacuum I had was the Roomba S9+ with the brava jet m6. I figured it was my carpet once again that may have caused issues so I thought it would get a vacuum that is the most powerful on the market to date. At first, I was blown away. I had superior carpet cleaning abilities a navigated just fine. The app is the worst of all three in my opinion, but I didn't care because of the power the vacuum had. It was nice that it was able to clean so close to the walls and get into small corners. However, after having it for three months I started notice it was not performing as well. The suction power was still there, but it would not clean entire rooms and miss big sections in rooms. After trouble shooting and getting in touch with support, I decided to return it. After all, if I am already having issues with it three months in what will a year look like and paying over a thousand dollars for a vacuum it should run flawlessly. I have nothing bad to say about the Brava M6 as I loved it and never had to worry about it however, I had to return both as they came in a packaged deal. 

In summary, and in my opinion, if you are looking for a home vacuum that requires little to no attention save your money. The technology is not there yet. It seems right now you have to either compromise on navigation for cleaning power or vice versa. I will say I feel robots need to get away from the round model as the S9 D shape is a game changer. It was nice to know that it was able to get as close to the wall as a normal vacuum. This may change as the rumored Roomba J9 comes out in a year or so. I just wish Roomba would get into the LIDAR business as its navigation is far superior than its camera navigation it has now and the Roomba I owned out cleaned the other models tenfold.  I hope this helps those of you who are looking into getting a robot vacuum. If you have an all-hard surface floor in your home, I would get a LIDAR bot as you don't need the power and it will most likely get the job done. If you have any carpet or rugs, I would save your money and wait until a more powerful, and better navigating robot hits the market. That is what am plaining on doing. I figure I will wait for a couple of years and see how the technology progresses."
"Any vacuums with lidar that work on black carpeting?I currently have a Wyze robot vac and it serves its purpose for the most part but I have several area rugs with black swirls that the robot seems to get ""trapped"" in.  I can't cover the cliff sensors because I have a few open staircases.  It constantly gets stuck as well on my black base bar stools.  At first I thought it was the incline, but I've found it frequently out of power almost flat at the base of the chairs.

"Deebot Ozmo T8 + Ozmo Pro Mopping System (400 USD) vs Roborock S7 (599 USD)Hi!

I recently sold my iRobot Roomba 960 and Braava jet m6, and then got the Deebot T8 and the Ozmo Pro Mopping System attachment for $400.

I have no problems with the performance of the cleaning system, but I am frustrated that with the Pro Mopping attachment, the app does not allow me to disable the mop (i.e. I have to remove the mop every time).

&#x200B;

The Roborock S7 has not been announced itself in my country, but I found out that I can get it for $599.

I can still return the Deebot T8 and the Pro mopping attachment thanks to Amazon, but I am not sure if I should return them and buy the Roborock S7.

&#x200B;

Please let me know your recommendations."
"Ecovacs deebot N8 VS Roborock S5 max?Hi all

I was after some advice, I've got mainly laminate flooring and some carpet, wanted a robot that can vacuum and mop.

According to the vacuum wars YouTube channel the N8 wins on performance but I've read worrying things about the ecovacs reliability record.

Is there general consensus on here on the best one to go for or any other brands or models to consider?
Want something that just works with minimal fuss and will be reliable.
 I'm in the UK so it's harder to get hold of Roborock but can probably get it on eBay :)

Advice appreciated!"
"New 360 owner to help others.I'm posting this for others as a source of information for this brand/model. I recently purchased the 360 S7 Pro from Amazon. I previously had the Neato D4 which I returned due to its lack of features I was looking for in a robot vac.

As I researched what to buy before and after the D4 I found myself having trouble finding reliable sources of reviews or in the 360's case just reviews. After finding one S7 Pro review on YouTube (that seemed like a non paid spot) and a bunch S9 reviews, I decided to pull the trigger. This was decided mostly based on specs/features to price. At the time of my purchase it was $290 after $100 discount. For that I got all the app features of a modern bot vac, multi floor maps, no go zones for vac and mop, clean rooms in w/e order I want (this was a BIG factor to me), and the vac itself was 2650pa suction.

Performance wise 360 says it's equivalent to the Roborock S5 Max. Idk if that helps you but I never owned a RR, though I read a lot of reviews saying it's carpet performance is ehh. The S7 Pro does quite well on our low pile carpets. Actually it seems to pick up more then the Neato which is surprising since the Neato brush is almost twice as big. I guess that PA does come in handy. It cleans all surfaces very good, though I think I would prefer RR rubber side brush then the bristles. I'm debating a way to use those on the 360. Nothing a dremal couldn't handle.

The navigation has been 100% spot on. Especially compared to the Neato and its lost in a circle actions. If I tell it to do the Living Room at Max power 2x then the playroom at powerful power 2x then the hallway at normal suction 1x it does exactly that avoiding all possible obstacles. At 100% suction power it can clean each room twice before it needs to recharge. When you clean the room twice it will go north /south on the 1st run, then east /west on the 2nd. I find this is probably the most efficient way to clean. Before each pass it cleans the borders. 

The dust bin is avg size, I would prefer a larger bin but at this price range the size seems standard. Both the D4 and S7 Pro get over our kitchen threshold which measures .7in. Though the Neato seemed to have less trouble. Our kids are still young enough where gates are needed, neither vac made it over them. Which still requires me to remove the gate or pick up the vac. Still making the idea of a robot vacuum not fully realized in our household.. 

As of this posting the RR S4Max is down to $320, If I wanted I can return the 360 and buy that. I've decided that I'm looking at a downgrade across the board if I do. I'd only be getting a well known brand over a lesser one.

Both are Chinese made, along with the Deebot and basically every brand on Amazon minus Irobot and Neato (Neato was American but was bought by a German company). I put my faith in the 360 and so far its paid off greatly! 

I will update this post if I see a need.

For reference we have 2 dogs and 2 kids."
"Ecovacs T8 vs Roborock S5 Max as explained by Chinese reviewersI know there's a lot of english videos comparing these, but I thought it would be interesting to check out what reviewers in China think, since these were made there and are fairly popular. (Oh also, forgot to mention, while the Chinese Roborock T7 is very similar to S5 Max, the key differences is that T7 has more advanced route calculation methods, 2 more cliff sensors, pressure sensor on the LIDAR part. Also it has different wall sensors apparently)

"Shark RV1001AE constantly spinning brushes...I have one of the earlier auto empty sharks that appears to be possessed by various demons. After less than a year of use, one of the wheel motors gave out, so I cannibalized a similar part off ebay and it's been humming along for a few months.

As of the past week, the left side brush spins constantly and at full speed. As in, even when sitting on the dock. Even if it has had its cleaning session canceled. When it runs a full ""mission"" the brush will stop spinning while the vacuum is charging, but as soon as the vacuum is at full charge the brush cuts on again even though its just sitting on the base.

I tried resetting the vacuum in the app. The behavior returned at the end of the first cleaning mission.

While this isn't really hurting anything, I have to listen to it if I'm in the same room, and it obviously isn't good long term for whatever motor drives it. I would contact shark but I'm sure for one that their troubleshooting is probably worthless, and for two that they arent about to warranty a two year old refurb I have already performed open heart surgery on.

Currently I just manually turn the vacuum off by the power switch when not in use, but I would like to actually fix it. It's actually a pretty good vacuum when it comes to sucking, and does better with dog hair in carpet than my roomba i7+, so I'd like to keep it in action. Any ideas as to the cause?"
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ecyszkgf381.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c3622533c2030046dbef7725b811ae4c8140468

 

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"New RoboVac owner.I recently posted a question here about what vacs to buy for a certain price. I was going back and forth between the Neato D4 and 360 S5/S7 Pro and a few others. I ended up going with the Neato, and in terms of pickup it seems to be fantastic! But I've never owned a bot before, so who knows lol.. My issue is, I like the performance but Neatos app seems to be severely weak in functionality. Basically turn on vac, turn off and no go lines. That's it.

I was looking to get more options and cleaning ability, ie go clean living room at 50% and that's all. And now my wife tells she might want a robo mop option also 👀👀.

Idk what to do, I have 4 weeks to return the D4, and I am kinda disappointed in it though as a pure vac it seems to do its job perfectly fine. What you guys think? Return and go a different direction? Keep the D4? Everything I read, all these older Neatos are basically DOA now and will NOT get any updates, upgrades etc. Neato has moved on to next round of vacs. So in also stuck with a dead end upgrade path 😣."
"Reproducing the CFM rating given by producers/reviewers.Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I recently ended in a position that gave me access to several premium brands of robot vacuums. So me and some nerdy friends decided to check out the performance of some of these kind. Just mostly out of curiosity. And to see how accurate the numbers were given by people who review these products or producers.

&#x200B;

This is kind of what brought me here, as were kind of stumped by a finding that were not fully able to explain. As the title has hinted, this is regarding the CFM rating given by producers/ reviewers you can find online.

&#x200B;

We reproduced the test as seen in this video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2xpwdZh0KQ&t=400s&ab\_channel=VacuumWars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2xpwdZh0KQ&t=400s&ab_channel=VacuumWars) With an anemometer and a similar box + setup. But to our surprise, the numbers.... they are not even close to what the producer or the reviewer is claiming. In the best case we got a velocity measurement between 2 to 3 m/s (not feet, but even with conversion this make no sense). With the formula of CFM being just a simple area (the mouth of robot vacuum) x the velocity. You wouldn't even get anything to something as high as the numbers claimed by this reviewer or the factory. For the record, the average square meter of mouth of the vacuum is around 0.05m\^2. We tried even measuring the velocity at the mouth (expecting a higher value obviously), with little difference.

&#x200B;

A little theory crafting=> To get a value of 17 CFM you'd need a velocity of 350 m/s or 1148 f/s. That is if we take the area of suction average of 0.05m\^2.  I mean this can't be right?

&#x200B;

I felt this would be the best place to ask this question as... well I am sure you guys would find the important too. But I am asking if were doing something wrong? Or is there a big conspiracy going on and are both reviewers and the factory making of numbers?"
"Buying Advice for a Newbie(Based in the UK for the sake of recommendations, prices etc)

Having spoken with a family member who owns one, they recommended the [Cordey 750](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coredy-Vacuuming-Sweeping-Controls-Self-Charging/dp/B082W3RXQR/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=Coredy%20r750&qid=1625240622&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSjMyVFQ3MUREV1NYJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODMyMjQzMklKT0dJRjgyNDk3QSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDE1OTUzMklBTTBFWkNNVVVNMSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3Bob25lX3NlYXJjaF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&fbclid=IwAR3b9iJCcNM5QUXWNZhcoVQOYgM8DMu9UclOq4NDTMAD8ItNDTiC36G5Bqo)  that they purchased on Amazon Prime Day. Has the ability to swap attachments for Mopping, which according to her would work, as long as I close the Bedroom and Living Room doors. It has boundry strips that I can use on the step to prevent it from falling off the step. And a decent price point at £230 round about.

Is this a generally good recommendation based on my needs? Are there other options that might provide more benefits or better performance? Is the brand generally trusted? Looking for any and all advice on the matter to help a first time buyer commit to a model with confidence."
"N8+ or S5max? Both on sale for today!N8 plus is 420 at.BB and the s5max is 380 on Amazon.

I want something reliable.

I just returned my brand new ihome autovac nova which I loved but lasted exactly 3 cleanings and 36 hours before something stopped working and now the robot can't even go on a straight line....

I have 1200sqft apartment with 2 bedrooms, 3 carpets, and mostly hardwood. 1 dog. Sand is unlikely to be an issue.

I really like the appeal of a auto empty bin but I'm not sure if it's worth it if the n8 performs a lot worst or is just going to break down."
"Purchase dilemma - Roborock S5 Max or S6 MaxV?Hi guys!  
I moved from a flat to a 4 story house recently and the vacuuming and mopping became a hassle.  
We also adopted 2 kittens some time ago.  


Never had a robot vacuum, but thought it would be the perfect solution when I discovered that there are vacuum+mop robot combos out there now.  


Did some research and with my budget I was thinking about the Evovacs T8 AIVI, the Roborock S5 Max and S6 MaxV. The camera/AI features sound neat and many youtube reviews seem to agree, but:  
\- in my country (Poland), there's no official Evovacs presence, which means that the T8 AIVI costs about 30% higher than the S6 MaxV, which is above my budget and kinda expensive in comparison to other sales regions  
\- because of the above, I already thought that I made the choice, but I started discovering the threads about people being disappointed with S6 MaxV carpet performance.  


We have wooden and tile floors that cover like 80% of all floors, but we do have some carpets (one of them being a shaggy-type) possibly with more carpets coming in soon so I wouldn't want to compromise with buying a premium robot vac-mop which would give poor performance.  


I don't want to wait till Roborock introduces a new improved generation of bots, so ATM should I just buy the S5 Max or are there some other choices that I should consider at this point?"
I was wondering if anyone has ECOVAC OZMO PRO MOPPING SYSTEM?If you do how does it perform vs the standard mop? I am loving the T8 right now. Much better than the s9 and my family no long complains on how loud the robot is.
How is 360 S9 robot vaccum?How is it's performance and can we get it's spare parts here in Canada?
"Needing advice for newbieI need a robot vacuum for a 3 bedroom apt. 1500 Sq ft with laminate living room/kitchen floors but carpet in the bedrooms. I don't need it to clean the rooms although it would be nice.

The main goal is to keep the kids areas cleaner. I know I'll need to sweep and mop regularly, but I need something to keep things tidy in between those days. 

Any suggestions for a decent robo boi with great flat floor performance and maybe some good carpet power? Trying not to spend over $300-$400. My wife isn't on board with the idea. I think if I get something affordable AND helpful first, she might be open to spending a little more later down the line."
"Samsung R7070: more effective to run at medium or high suction?Hi all,

I’ve got a Samsung R7070 vacuum. I find that it doesn’t often pick up even light dirt (like a piece of fuzz that I can easily pick up with my fingers). What’s better: higher suction but less run time (presumably fewer passes with the brush) or medium suction (more passes)? Any other troubleshooting tips? I’ve cleaned the foam filter under water and checked the air flow path.

Edit for future readers: I’ve switched to medium suction and that has improved performance."
"S9+ Alternatives?Recently purchased an S9+, my first robo vacuum. When it works, it’s great. Really like the self emptying bin and cleaning power. 

The issue is that I’m constantly getting Error 31. Given the prevalence of the error, I’m not sure that a new replacement will perform much better. 

Are there any good alternatives at the “premium” level? Ideally would have self emptying capability, strong cleaning and navigational features (have a pet that sheds), and is reliable. 

Some of the new 2021 CES models look promising but are also untested and I’m not sure when they’re coming out. 

Any good alternatives?"
"Another Decision Question. Roborock editionSo y'all basically got me on Roborock. Now the decision is between the Roborock S7 or the S6 MaxV. Both are within $50 of each other on amazon.
Do the AI cameras on the 6 make it the better buy, or the better mopping on the S7? Any performance differences?"
"Roborock S5 Max v/s Ecovacs Ozmo 950 and Ecovacs T8 AIVI (Especially mopping)After reading several reviews I’m convinced that S5 Max comes with a better UI/app experience. But, there aren’t many reviews comparing the mopping performance of these 3 robots.  
I don’t mind spending an additional $100 for the Oscillating Pro mop if it truly does better than the S5 Max.

Thoughts ? Has anyone bought both and compared ?"
"Recommendations on a mop & vacuumHi 

I've been reading up on these robots for the past few days and I am extremely torn so hoping to hear someone else's opinion. My wife and I just got a puppy, which has led her to a lot of vacuuming and mopping which id like to avoid her having to do. We have the same floor throughout the entire house, there are no saddles, its all a wood tile. First ill break down what I view as positive features:

- strong suction vacuum
- avoiding obstacles (specifically poop)
- self emptying bin
- mopping that actually somewhat cleans so we don't need to use a real mop too often
- a large enough water tank to hit the entire house on one run (1650 sq ft)
- ties into Google assistant

The 2 products I've been in between are:

Option 1:
Roborock S6 MaxV

Or

Option 2:
iRobot S9+ with the Braava S6

For option 1, I view it as a better all around device, it definitely can avoid poop with its new camera array, it has plenty of power, water storage and its all built in to one device. The negatives are the bin will constantly need to be emptied which with a dog will probably be frequent and I am not sure what the mopping function is really worth.

For option 2: I view this as a device dedicated for one specific thing will perform that function at a higher rate. Although when comparing the roborock to the s9 there are mixed reviews in terms of which vacuum is more powerful. The vacuum does have the self emptying bin which will make this more seamless and the suction is still powerful. The rollers seem to work better with the hair which applies for both my wife and pup. The negatives are I am not confident that it can avoid poop, and I am not sure how much better the Braava S6 is. 

Would love some feedback here as pertaining to the situation I've laid out here. Obviously money is a factor but just trying to compare apples to apples right now. Thanks!

"Is this i7 (i8+) sound normal?Hi all, I'm just now on my second run with my i8+ (Costco exclusive version of i7+). I have been using a 980 for years, so that's what I'm used to.

I was expecting the i8 to be much quieter than my 980, which it is, but I'm just not sure it sounds ""right."" The motor sounds are very obvious, louder than the suction sounds. There is no clicking or banging (as I've seen some people experience), except the clicking I can hear on tile floors as I assume the rubber rollers are dropping periodically. It's also louder on hard floor than carpet, which I've read is expected because it now vents downwards.

I also have a Litter Robot litter box, and the i8 sounds very similar to the motor on the Litter Robot when it is cycling. I ran my 980 on eco-mode to see if its motor sounds the same, but the suction on that bot is so loud I couldn't really tell.

It appears to be cleaning well, as best I can tell, so no performance issues, just wanted to check with other owners to see if it should make a mostly motorized sound when it runs.

TIA!"
"What do you guys think about the Eufy RoboVac L70 Hybrid?I just placed an order for one on Amazon. I don't think I'll need the mopping part of it but the reason I picked it up (other than the price) is the laser path thingy and the suction power. I wanted to know from current owners though, how is it performing months later?"
Shark RV2011Anyone have experience with this model? I previously had the Shark IQ model from Costco but returned it. Didn't like that I needed to lay down border strips. This newer model has laser navigation and you can set no go zones in the app. Granted the Costco model had the self empty bin but I could do without that for better mapping and better navigation. Just wanted to herlat about performance experiences.
"Roomba e5 or Eufy 15C MAX?Hi,

I'm looking to buy my first robot vacuum. Currently debating between the Roomba e5 or Eufy 15C MAX.

The vacuum will be used on tile and hardwood floors. I also have a medium sized dog with short hair that sheds a lot.

The Eufy 15C MAX is cheaper, but I'm willing to pay a little bit more if the Roomba e5 performs better.

Which one would you recommend?

Thanks!

"Google home Commands, DeebotI can start ,pause, stop and dock my Deebot via Google home Commands.....but is there I way to ask it to perform Edge cleaning mode via voice command?"
"Best robot vacuum under 7.15 cm (2.81 inches) height?I am looking for the best vacuum in terms of performance and convenience under 7.15 cm (2.81 inches) height. Power suction, smart navigation, low maintenance and connectivity are some of the things I value. Wet mopping could be also useful. Must work with 220 volts (Europe).

For now my first option is Bagotte BG800 which claims to be 6.9cm / 2.7 inches tall. ECOVACS DEEBOT OZMO Slim10 is another option. The Deebot one is much slimmer than what I need, I think it has a low suction and much worst reviews on Amazon than the Bagotte one. I think is also less technologically developed than the Bagotte BG800. Unfortunately Bagotte BG800 lacks integration with HomeAssistant but that might be asking for too much. Bagotte BG800 is also very cheap for what it seems to provide although I am not looking for the vacuum to be cheap (I own several Roomba 980 which are more expensive but I can not use them on the room I want this slim vacuum for).

Any suggestions?

EDIT: I have confirmed that Bagotte BG800 is 6.9cm / 2.7 inches tall WITHOUT the wheels so it will not work in this case."

"Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni - early review & initial thoughtsAfter the disappointing iRobot Roomba J7+, I had intended to go all out and get myself a Roborock S8 Pro Ultra. Unfortunately, getting one in the UK proved challenging. Amazon Germany say they will ship to the UK, but this turned into a bit of a nightmare.

Anyway, while I was stuck in the hellish void that is not owning a robot vacuum cleaner, like some kind of caveman, Ecovacs went and released the T20 Omni. It ticks all my boxes, on paper at-least, and for a change Amazon UK had stock and £300 off. So I thought I would give it a shot. Ecovacs is not a brand I have ever really considered much, partly because removing the pads to clean carpet (no longer an issue with this model) would have been a deal breaker for me. I haven’t been able to find a YouTube video or website review that isn’t basically a paid advert (many say they get sent them for free but the review is ‘their words’. Sure, but no one want to upset the companies that give them stuff to generate content with, anyway…). Even the Amazon listing had no reviews at the time of purchase, so maybe I’m mad, but for what it’s worth, here is my entirely unbiased initial thoughts after a solid day of testing. Hope it helps others considering this robot vacuum cleaner. 

Early impressions mostly good, maybe getting towards very good, but not ‘smashed it out of ballpark’ amazing. Yet anyway. It’s a lot more customisable than Roomba in terms of cleaning settings, so I’m still getting my head around what works best for my house and family, so as I say, these are first impressions and take that as you will. 

For a start, my Roomba J7+ just couldn’t get my golden retrievers hair off my low pile living room rug, at the most it just bunched it up into clumps so I could pick them up myself. No mater how many passes, or what I tried, it just didn’t have the power. Initially I was disappointed with the T20’s performance on the same rug, but after tweaking the settings for deeper clean, more passes and higher suction etc, the rug is now almost as clean as it is after a manual vac with my Dyson. So I’m very pleased about that, if it failed that test it was going back and I would have to go back the the drawing board for sourcing Roborock S8. 

It’s still a bit annoying how long it needs to achieve an acceptable clean of the rug, but as long as I’m not doing it my self I guess I don’t really care, it can do it when I sleep or I’m out at work or hiking. And my large-ish (by UK standards) house is mostly tile and oak wood floors, with a couple of low pile rugs. 

However, what I will say is that this is absolutely not a vac for people with mostly carpet, or even a lot of rugs and pets. If that’s your house, then don’t even entertain the thought of the T20, this isn’t the vacuum you are looking for. The settings required to achieve a just-about-acceptable carpet clean would kill the battery in minutes or take literally forever, if at all. Basically all you need to know is it’s next to useless on carpet, unless you have a very small amount you can hammer it with. 

Vacuuming wood, tile and slate floors seems more then sufficient, but what vac isn’t (unless you have deep crevices, which I don’t so can’t comment). The spinning mop pads work well, I prefer this approach to the pads most just drag around. Seems to actually clean, not just wipe. It also lifts them a good amount on carpet, no issues with wet rugs, which it does a great job of accurately detecting. 

The vac itself has no water tank built in. I’m not yet sure if this is a pro or a con. I can see this approach has a number of possible upsides (less to go wrong, more room for larger vacuum motors and batteries etc, less weight to carry around). The downside it has to keep going back to the dock to wash and wet the mopping pads (user configurable to 5, 10 or 15 minute intervals). The travel time and cleaning time adds considerable length to the cleaning, as it did this about 4 or 5 times. This could be an issue for some people, and may outweigh the benefits, especially if you wanted to mop every day. I plan once a week, so I’ll chose a day when the whole family are out all day and time is not an issue. 

Build quality seems decent, not quite as good as the Roomba in that respect, certainly not what I think it should be for the money, but yeah it’s fine, whatever. The dock is big but not quite as bad as I was expecting. Water tanks etc seem well made and easy to access and fill. Pad cleaning and drying works as advertised, but I will need much longer with it for a better idea. 

For those that haven’t used the Ecovacs app - it pretty meh. Not quite as user friendly as iRobot’s, but it has a lot more settings so it’s fair compromise. Not as good as Roborocks from what I have seen. But it gets the job done. I like the Apple shortcuts support, so I can create some home automation’s like not running and giving a warning when a door sensor detects a door it need access though is closed, more control over schedules, starting when the last person leaves the house etc. 

The battery seems to take forever to charge. But maybe the J7+ was smaller so it seemed quicker. I’m also perhaps being impatient with my new toy. I think it’s adequate though, unless you are planning to do a large house, including mopping and multiple passes. 

It’s probably not really fair to say much more at this point, without some more long term use. Straight out the box it did miss quite a few spots. It also simply refused to go a few places that even the stupid J7+ would, which just basically just blundered about, smashing into stuff and cleaning under my dining room table for example was a complete lottery. All my mid century furniture with its many narrow legs probably doesn’t help, but I was expecting a LiDAR based system to be a bit better at getting through stool legs and such like. It also didn’t get close enough to the walls quite frequently, leaving quite a bit of debris. Maybe the mapping will improve and there are a lot of settings that I think might help with it’s navigation, so I’ll see what changes and tweak can be made before making any definitive assessments. 

So it could be a keeper with a bit of work, but as I say, I need a few days with it. However so far it’s looking promising."
"Problems with the newly bought Dreame F9 cleaning botI bought a new Dreame F9 cleaning bot last week. I haven't been able to make it work fully. Below are the problems faced.

1. The robot cleans a small area in a crazy pattern. It moves backward a lot hitting obstacles. And in some time, it says cleaning completed. Next time when the cleaning is restarted, it follows a different pattern in a different area (sometimes the same area also). I was hoping that this way it was building up the map. But the map doesn't seem to be accurate with respect to the position of the base station. Also, it's taking a lot of time to do this small area. So it does small areas with some overlap every time and says cleaning is completed.
2. There are 2 big problems with the bot.
   1. It never finds the base station. Even if the bot is just starting the cleaning, if I give a return to base command, it cannot find the base station. It goes all over the place and finally, voice prompt says to move the bot to the base station. 
   2. Every 5 minutes or so, the bot stops with a voice message ""obstacle detected, please reposition"". And the bot will be in an open area with no obstacles at all. And it's very frustrating because it happens almost every 5-10 minutes. If I just give the resume cleaning option in the app, it continues cleaning normally for the next 5-10 minutes.

Tried solutions:

1. Cleaned the base station and the bot (sensors).
2. Factory reset the bot and reinstalled the app.
3. Moved the base station to a lot of different positions which included a very open area also.
4. Tried in day and night conditions with different lighting.

None of this worked. Has anyone faced these kinds of problems with Dreame F9 or Xiaomi robot and how did you fix it?

Any pointers will be helpful. Thanks!"
"Large home vacuum recommendations?We're building a new home, and planning on robovac usage (not using one currently). I've been doing some research and haven't come across definitive answers based on home size. I would like vac + mop functionality with minimal maintenance, although I realize some maintenance is required. 

Relevant factors:

**Home size**: Roughly 3200 sq ft main floor, 1800 sq ft second floor. I would expect this means 2500 sq ft and 1500 sq ft of actual flooring to clean respectively (taking furniture and such into consideration).  
**Flooring**: tile/hardwood, no carpet  
**Budget**: Open   
**Other**: One large dog that sheds year round, medium-fine 1"" hair. Two kids that are somewhat messy, crumbs, minor spills.

From my reading, it seems like going with one robovacuum per floor would be easiest, but one (depending on model) should be able to cover both floors if i was open to carrying it up and down stairs.

Would any of the newer models out there have a problem cleaning 2500 sq ft?   
Would it require two, or am I well within the bounds of using a single robot?  
Would that entail a robot supporting recharge/resume functionality?  
What are the downsides if the dock is not located centrally?

Appreciate any input. I've been looking at the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, but open to other brands/models."
"Ecovacs Deebot ""Area"" mapping issuesI picked up an Ecovacs Deebot 950 yesterday.  My only prior experience with a robot vacuum was a weekend with a borrowed Roborock S6, which I really liked.  I wanted to try something different, and on paper, the Deebot is the better machine.  In practice, after only one day with the robot, I would say that they are very similar in many respects and overall, I am happy with it thus far.

&#x200B;

One area that I am frustrated by though, is the ""area"" mapping.  Since I was in a rush to play with my new toy and the battery needed a charge (5 hours by the way!), I was unable to do one complete run through of my house in Auto mode.  Instead, I used what little charge it had to map part of the house (by closing doors) and then after charging it a bit, I opened the doors and used virtual boundaries to direct it to the new areas.  This DID in fact add to the ""master"" map, but it seems to really confuse the algorithm that creates rooms (or areas as they are known in the Ecovacs app).  I had previously labelled some of the rooms, but the auto algorithm just blatted over those!

&#x200B;

Furthermore, the ""divide area"" functionality is either 100% broken, or incredibly fussy.  I have never got it to work - not once.

&#x200B;

I think what I need to do is let it map the entire house again from scratch.  This is a bit of a pain since it is not often that we are ALL out of the house for an extended period of time.  Also, I am concerned that if I ever do an ""Auto"" run and accidentally close a door, it will just blat over my labelled areas again.

&#x200B;

I'd be interested to hear some other thoughts / experiences."
"Rove L3510Is this a good vacuum?  Reviews on Walmart (almost fully 5-stars) contrast significantly with amazon (\~2.5 stars).  Hard to imagine the reviews on Walmart are not bought.

In principle this vacuum looks great, and is probably a rehash of other's technology.  Looking at this for $150 in place of the Wzye with LiDAR for the same price that is completely out of stock."
"Used Robot VacuumHello! I'm looking to buy a used robot vacuum cleaner. I leave on a quite big 1 bedroom apartment with only 2 thin carpets but a lot of cables, and the floor gets really messy (I have people over really often). I decided on getting a Roborock S7 MaxV, as I want something that would put me through as little struggle as possible. I know it's a really expensive for a 1 bedroom apartment but I've been saving some money and I want to get the best thing. But I would want to buy it second hand, not only to save money but also for some other reasons of principle. What should I pay attention to? Some of the ads say how many hours the robot has been used but I don't if the number is alright. Also, are there fake robot vacuums and if there are how can I spot one? I found a Roborock S7 Max V second hand for 400 euro/440, is that ok?"
"Shark IQ - Error code 26Hey all - I've just gotten a Shark IQ (may have been duped by the RobotWars video, not sure yet).

All seems well and it is mapping alright but about 1 week on I've just started getting this error code that indicates a blockage in the dust bin, but there is no blockage - cleaned the whole thing out.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Any thoughts?"
"Am I being unrealistic?We have a carpet in the front room and also have a labrador that sheds an extraordinary amount of fur. There are also two ladies in the home with long hair. Beyond the front room, the rest of the ground floor is hardwood.  All of this is on one floor - downstairs.

I am looking for a robot mopping vac that can take care of downstairs, because.. well.. life is too short. 

I've been looking at roborock and dreame.  I've watched tens of ytube videos and read many reviews. I get the feeling that the carpet will be a problem? Do any of the current robomopvacs actually genuinely cope with a home with both types of flooring?"
"Please replace filer error Dreame D9Hi guys,

My dreame D9 has been acting up lately.

 It will only run on silent mode. 

If I put it into any higher mode I will get the error message ""please replace filter"". 

I have already opened it and cleaned the sponge at the exhaust point aswell as any other potential risk for airflow. I replaced the filter and both brushes with genuine parts aswell as lubcricated the fan with some silicone spray. spins much more easy now. 

The error still persists. I can see it goes into full power for like 20 seconds where it vacuums but then it keeps getting me the error. 

I have reset the device aswell as the filters in the settings.

does anyone have an Idea what it could be?

I feel like my nidec fan still works proper after I lubricated it.

Im happy for any tips Ideas!!!"

Roidme Eva vs Robock S7Anyone have thoughts on the Roidme Eva? Its pretty cheap and has cleaning of the mop built in. Not sure if its just a prototype or something since its on Indiegogo only. There seems to be a bunch of paid for videos on YouTube but not much else genuine reviews on it online. How is it compared to the Roborock S7?
"Robot Vacuum that gets pet hair off Carpet? Recommendations needed! :) (2021/2022)**TL;DR: Please suggest some Robot vacuum that ticks as many of the boxes below as possible. (Especially being able to do a 9/10 job at picking up dog hair off carpet.) :)**  


Also, I'm in Australia if that would affect your recommendations. :)   
\_\_

Hey guys, Lab and a Husky owner here, and... I'm sure you can imagine how much daily housework that makes. :)

I was gifted an ancient old robot vacuum a few years ago, but it was useless on carpet/rugs.  
It wasn't actually a ""vacuum"" so much as it was a robotic broom with a spinning brush. And it needed a rescue at least once a day, from it's little spot under the fridge. Always the same bloody problem!

Still my home at the time was mostly hardwood and it sort of reduced how much work I needed to do between proper cleans.

Looks like they've come a long way since then. But are they now good enough for pet hair on carpet?

I currently live in a 2 story townhouse with hardwood/tile downstairs, and a big rug. But upstairs is all carpet, and the stairs are carpeted too (So they'll always be a manual vacuum).

**I'm hoping it can pretty much genuinely replace an actual vacuum, and hoping that it:**

1. Is **safe for dog paws** and tails if they get curious. (MUST).
2. Can **do a pretty good job on carpet/rugs. I mostly mean in getting up Pet Hair,**because it wouldn't be worth it to me if I still had to clean up much more than the last 5%-10% of it. But also, just in general, I'd like it to be a good vacuum. (In most cases, the carpet/rug would be pretty short pile and a regular vaccum can do a good job, but it can take a few passes).
3. Can **Mop hard surfaces.** (Not a deal breaker if not, but super cool if it can).
4. Is pretty **good at navigating it's environment.** (Maybe maps it in real time, and/or ""learns"" it for next time so that as long as I leave the dock in the same place, it knows where obstacles were last time, and how to get back home). Can get home, even if something sends it off course. Cleans in an efficient pattern, so it can clean more area.
5. Doesn't make more work for me than it's worth. I don't want to have to rescue it from stairs, or under furniture. (**If it gets stuck... 9/10 times it should be able to figure it out**).
6. **Can get into tight spaces** (under low couches, or has **suction to pick up dirt/dust from a corner).**
7. Is smart (or programable) enough to **know that it needs to do Carpet 2-3 times to be effective.**
8. Has **Good/Smart features** (Maybe an app, and smart home enabled?). Things I haven't even mentioned here or thought about, but still **easy to use.**
9. Has **Long(ish) Battery and/or Quick Charge.** Hopefully it can finish a couple of small to medium carpeted rooms before returning home. If it runs out of power before it can, would be cool if it knew it only half finished, and would go back there when it gets a chance.
10. **Is Quiet(ish)?** My old one was pretty quiet because it didn't ""suck"", so not sure if that's realistic or not. But ... would love if it could work around me while watching TV, and if it didn't bother the dogs. But if not, I'd like to be able to schedule it for when I'm not doing stuff (or manually start over wifi or something, it even if I'm away).

Hoping I didn't just describe a $10,000 future vacuum, because that mostly seems pretty standard stuff, right? :)

Obviously cheaper is better, but **if I need to cough up more to pick up dog hair of carpet and not spend an hour a day doing it manually, I will give up my first born.** :)

I would pay extra for that one thing... but probably wouldn't care to pay a HEAP more for some of the other things on my list. (I'd live if it got stuck a little too much, or needed to charge a bit more often to finish the house, or if I had to manually finish the corners of some rooms).

Let me know if I missed anything. And feel free to tell me if there's just not a product out there that can do this, or where I might have to compromise.

Thanks!"

"Roborock s7 water tank issuesHello. 

Having to create a new account to hopefully get some help from you knowledgeable fellows. 

I had until recently been very happy with my Roborock s7. 

I then discovered that the water tank was leaking and had developed cracks. Thinking I had possibly banged it... I bought another one. 1 month later the same cracks in the same spots that gradually get worse. Buy another tank and think I should be careful and run it and keep an eye. Less than 10 runs in and more cracks. Same places that get worse with every run. They look like stress fractures as well and slowly develop all over.

I have contacted Roborock for advice or guidance to no avail and I dont want to buy another to keep spending 16 euros a month on new water tanks. 

To clarify: 
1) latest tank definitely wasn't banged, nudged or dropped. 
2) The last tank had nothing but plain water inside of it. 
3) The first cracks are always around the port for the robot nozzle that feeds water to the drip feature. 
4) The water tanks were all genuine roborock tanks. 
5) I have a grated area in my flat that I think might be an issue, but I am unsure if it's the climbing of carpet to floor or something else that could cause this. And event then.... these cracks look extreme for that. 

Happy to provide pictures if people feel they need clarification, but perhaps someone already has the same experience or an idea. Looking around I seem to have a unique issue. 

Thank you in advance."
"Aftermarket filters?Hello all, I just bought a Neato D4 and was wondering if aftermarket filters are any good for this type of robot vacuum. I'm leaning toward the genuine filters, but a 6 pack of equivalent aftermarket filters for the same price as a 2 pack of genuine filters is tempting. Let me know what you think."
"Replacement battery for irobot i8+So my irobot battery on my i8 shorted out due to water damage. It won't charge at all anymore. The base still recognizes it is connected to a robot when it's on the base. However I cannot do anything because the robot is that dead. No reset, no lights. No one is home. 

The irobot site sells a new battery for $89. Same with Amazon for a authentic one. 

What I see a lot in reviews on Amazon is ""robot does not recognize the battery,"" or ""gives battery error."" 

Does anyone know of a off brand that actually works with the robot?

Edit: I think I found one at batteries plus bulbs. At least I would have a physical place to return it"
Replacement shark ai ultraI posted the other day about being granted a replacement by shark support because my robot bricked itself.  What broke was a rv2520aous. What I received was a rv2520azus. Seems I got a much newer model even though my original was only six months old.  They must be on to a newer redesign at this point.
Vac Mop 5ghzWhat brand of vac mops can connect to a 5 gigahertz Network? I purchased a Yeti that could only connect to a 2.5 GHz Network and I was unable to connect it to my home network. Please advise.

"Chinese robots concernReading headlines of products like Huawei being banned for national security purposes. I feel like we should be just as concerned about products like roborock and ecovacs. Am I crazy for thinking this? And the reviews put those two manufacturers over all the others. Roomba is US based but doesn’t seem to use LIDAR. 

Yea it’s a vacuum but it is still a Chinese robot that can watch, listen, maneuver around the house at night, map out your entire house, connect to your Wi-Fi network, see when your home or away, etc. Yes, you can say the same about the US robo vacs but if they’re banning Huawei I would assume roborock and ecovac would be just as much of a security threat.

"Can I fix it?My eufy l70 just dropped one of the charging sensors the other day. I purchased in May, but via Amazon renewed, so eufy says my 1yr warranty is shorted to 90 days and I’m SOL. I’m inclined to think this COULD be an easy fix, what do you think? Do vacuum repair shops even exist?"
"Bad luck or super common?I got a wyze robot vacuum for Christmas and was super excited. I got it all set up and then went to connect it to my wifi as I already have the wyze app and their security cameras. It refused to connect to the wifi, so I tried at least a dozen times, then the next day spent over an hour speaking with customer support doing everything they asked, it just wouldn't work. So I returned it and got the shark self emptying robot vacuum. It was a bit more expensive, but I like the shark brand and was hoping it would work better. I get it all set up, and it connects easily to the wifi. I go to use it after it charged and it keeps giving me error messages saying that it senses a cliff and to move it, but no matter where I move it it claims to be sensing a cliff, and it keeps saying error bin is not installed, even though it is fully clicked into place. Is this just bad luck, or why am I having such bad luck with these robot vacuums?"
"Roborock S7 privacy and mopping performanceHi, 

This post is more of a reference for anyone who's searching for information on the S7 Roborock and is concerned about internet privacy/security and its mopping performance

This is **not a comprehensive review** and will **only focus on two things:** 

1. Performance without being connected to the internet ever (for those that have XL tinfoil hats like myself) 
2. Mopping performance

&#x200B;

**1. Performance despite never being connected to the internet: Great.** 

The good: 

* Easily controlled with the push buttons on the top
* Still maps the area and then vacuums in a grid pattern
* Auto detects whether it's on carpet or hard floor and changes the vacuum speed and deploys the mop
* Still returns to base to charge etc.
* Spot clean function is good for area cleaning.

The bad: 

* No idea what strength of vacuum it's on and can't change. 
* Can't change the water level of the mop either
* To do the spot clean  I have to pick the S7 up, put it in the affected area, and press the 'spot clean' rather than just telling it through an app. 

**2.  Mopping performance: poor**

The good:

* Auto detects hard floors

The bad:

* Without pre-wetting the mop it's pretty pathetic (may be related to not changing the setting in the app) 
* It doesn't raise the mop enough to not make the carpets slightly damp
* It doesn't do an amazing job of cleaning

&#x200B;

Overall: vacuum without internet connection is good, mopping is shit.   
**TLDR: If I was to buy again I would buy something with only a vacuum (maybe a J7 Roomba?)**"
"Upgrade fail from Eufy 11s to G30. Switch to Roomba?I had an Eufy 11s for years that I was very pleased with. I had to replace it’s components (including battery) several times but it wasn’t a big deal because it was easy and parts readily available. It would start, run without complaint, and do a pretty good job. Every couple of months it would fail to make it to the base station, but no big deal. 

I upgraded to a G30 Edge because I liked the 11s so much. I have been less than impressed so far. The app is lackluster (and it doesn’t have a remote for basic use), it fails to get to the base station 50% of the time, I think the random cleaning of the 11s did a better job because the mapping sucks and the vacuum doesn’t recharge and continue as expected, its constantly complaining that I need to clean its sensors (which I then do), and my long hair tangles it weekly minimum. Stark difference in satisfaction between the two models. 

My question is do I stick with Eufy and go for an X8 or jump ship to Roomba? If so, which model?

1000 square feet of hardwood, a couple low rugs, house is kept very tidy and was previously robo-vacuum proofed by securing all cords etc. No pets, two clean adults, one with long hair. If it matters, any kind of Alexa type stuff is wasted on me. I use homekit (but not siri) for home automation. I’m capable of adding products via Home Assistant or Homebridge if supported. I’d be more than happy with a remote that has a start button though."
"The first time to try a robot vacuum. My hands are free nowMy AIRROBO T10+ is amazing. My house has all wooden/laminate flooring, no carpet. I’ve had the Vacuum now for 3 days.

On the initial run it mapped out our home and vacuumed at the same time (see pic attached - kind of looks like the millennial falcon - and yes, we have a round house). As you can see from the pic it avoided our couch (L shaped white space that it can’t go under) and other items sitting on the floor. It’s amazing to see it go around chair legs, bed posts and other things on the floor and map out a path for effective coverage of the whole house. It does remind me somewhat of R2D2 as it spins to go different directions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l50jvyz163b91.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1338d272abde3a7e61cc8ee950c6e15717a57a07

I highly recommend you “Reset the map” on the first run. Out of the box mine showed a partial map when I first turned it on and let it dock to charge. If you reset the map it will go out and redraw you floor plan to map out your whole house.

The vacuuming (mopping discussed later) on the T10+ works very well. As I’ve played around with the Suction Level, I settled on Strong, but it still works well even with the Quiet Level. Especially with only hard flooring. I run on Quiet mode in the mornings if the family is not awake yet. The higher the Suction Level the louder the vacuum is, but even on Max I would equate it to slightly less noise than our regular upright vacuum (which we no longer need to use).

&#x200B;

One of my dogs sheds and it picks that hair up easily. The rest of the dogs are hypo allergenic so they don’t shed. Still, it does well cleaning up the hair of the one shedder.

From a mopping perspective we have 5 dogs, so we get a lot of muck/slobber/muddy paw prints on the floors. That’s why we don’t have carpet ;) I haven’t had the chance to clean up any mud yet, but will try to post a video when that happens. For the mopping settings I’ve found I need to use the High water setting to get enough water on the floor to mop effectively. But it does a nice job of mopping.

&#x200B;

I use the reusable “cloth” mop pad and simply rinse it after each use and let it dry. I have not tried the disposable pads included in the box yet. For my house I have to replace the water one time during a whole house mopping. I forget how big the water tank is, but it’s super easy to fill and pause the Vacuum during the process.

As you can see from another pic it shows my house has 78 square meters of floor space (upstairs level) that needs cleaning and takes it about 90 minutes to do so. The Vacuum doesn’t need to recharge at all during a cleaning cycle.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ukgxgdt263b91.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c14843c773cb404d12d648d2fbde94d577242c82

I have used it a few times to select a single room to clean. That’s a really nice feature.

The circular spots on my house map are where chairs, table legs and bed posts are. The lines you see on the floor plan is the route and vacuum took to clean.

I’ve been careful to secure cords out of the way on the floor so the unit does not get caught up on those. It does try to go straight over them if they not close to a wall. It’s very persistent. I even have a couple of spots where I have floor level transitions of about 1/2 inch and it climbs over those with ease (see video).

I love how with each vacuuming or mopping session the vacuum surveys the home or rooms you are going to clean each time. It does a perimeter check first to set the boundaries for where it will clean. Sometimes I have a dog bed or two laying somewhere and it can avoid it when there, and clean that same spot when it is not there.

&#x200B;

I’ve used the remote control a couple of times just to test it out and it is very nice. At one point I used it to have the mop go back and forth on some dried dog slobber and it took a few runs to clean that up. The remote is very easy to use, but I like to just tell it to clean and run on it’s own.

&#x200B;

I have not used the Scheduling features yet, but love that it had those as well. It’s also amazing how every time it goes back to the base it automatically empties the cleaned up contents into the main unit bag. I’ll try to remember to update how long I use it before I have to replace the bag.

&#x200B;

I know there are additional features I have not use yet and not discussed here, but I really love this vacuum and would highly recommend it."
"Vacuum recs for no Wi-Fi/little tech savvyHi y’all! I’m helping my older-ish parents look for a vacuum. They don’t have Wi-Fi where they live out in the sticks. My mom is okay with a little technology, but I think the more simple the more likely they would use it. I have Roborock S7 and love it, but I think that is too expensive and has too many features that can’t/won’t use. Any recommendations? 

I’m struggling because most things I search it talks about turning off the Wi-Fi for security. That’s not the issue."
"Recommendation for carpet cleaning robot vacuum?Hey guys, I hope this is the right sub for my questions. I'd like some recommendations for a good carpet cleaning robot. Here are some of my requirements and needs.

So I have [these carpets](https://imgur.com/a/TloU2cA) in my home, and the floors are mostly covered with this kind of carpet. I have very little ""naked"" floor, and I do not plan on buying deeper carpets, so it will be mostly of this kind.  
That's why I don't really care much about hard floor vacuum performance.  
I also don't have pets, don't walk with shoes on inside, and I mostly need good performance for picking up dust/dead skin from the carpets and the hard floors here and there. I live in the city, so the dust is constant and plentiful.

About mopping, I haven't decided if I need it. Maybe it would be nice if it could mop the hard floors here and there, but I never really stain them with something. If it would help with the dust cleaning, then let's have it.

The Roombas look good for my needs, but to me they seem like they are falling behind on some of the technologies and innovations, and I'd really love to have the newest technologies. For example I'd like to have the Roborock's feature of being able to view the camera feed at all times, and even navigate the robot yourself. It's almost like a security system.

P.S. Bonus points if the robot is taller, rather than wider, as it would be easier for it to go under some of the kitchen chairs and in some corners."
"Robot vacuum with offline nav capabilitiesHello, i am looking for an robot vacuum, which would have the best navigation capabilities in offline mode. I would like the vacuum to be able to clean multiple rooms with good accuracy. My concerns are on the privacy and security side of things. 

I have heard of some open source self hosted services which can be used in combination with rooting. I am open to all suggestions."
"Looking for a bot to adoptHi everyone,

Been looking before posting and didn't see anything related to this.

We  have a good duo of Roombas at work and they do a great job (vet clinic,  7 women, I let you imagine the amount of hair and dust they have to  deal with). Really pumped up by Bob & Ike (our roombas) and their  performance,  I'm looking forward into buying a vaccum robot friend to  help me keep the house clean.

Only  problem so far : I have a big ass sofa on relatively short feet : 8,5cm  (3,35in). I would have loved to adopt a Roomba, but they are all around  9,5cm (3,74in).  I've seen some models that are ""ultra slim"" with 5,5  to 8cm (2,17 - 3,14 inches), but often some obscure brands on Amazon  (and i'm not so open with the idea of my data being stored in an unknown  company's servers).

They also  tend to all have a wet cleaning feature (which I really don't need imo),  not sure if it's bullshit, if it only takes out dust, or if it really  cleans the floor well. What's your opinion on this ? If it works, any  pet-friendly detergent I can put in it ?

So my dream bot would be :

\- With an app **and secured/trusted servers** / Without an app but with a remote (no random-only mode, I don't want my bot to act like an old blind & deaf Dachshund).- From a trusted/reliable brand- 8cm (3,14in) tall or under (the hardest part)- With central rotative extractor (one or two brushes), as I don't really trust the simple vaccuming hole- Able to handle pet hairs (3 short haired cats)- (Optional)  with two lateral brushes- (Optional) with a square front end for corners

I know I'm asking a lot, but what would you recommend me with those criteria ?

(Done a lot for research too and only found the Deebot Ozmo Slim10 to answer to my wishes but at 850€ it's WAY above my budget)

Thanks to everyone who read this, best wishes to everyone for the upcoming year."
"Any with only local network access?Just got a Roborock s4 max but after discovering its security issues, privacy policies, and network traffic usage I've decided to return it.

If not, are there any recommendations for one that has decent navigation without any wifi capabilities?

"Charging base on carpet?Hey there everybody!

&#x200B;

I have a roborock s50 cleaning my home and there was only one spot where I could put the charging base, but it's in a very annoying place and yesterday I almost kicked it accidentally. There is only one more spot I could put it, but it is on a carpet. Is it ok to put the base on a carpet if I make sure that the base is secured in place and it is correctly levelled?"
"Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni - early review & initial thoughtsAfter the disappointing iRobot Roomba J7+, I had intended to go all out and get myself a Roborock S8 Pro Ultra. Unfortunately, getting one in the UK proved challenging. Amazon Germany say they will ship to the UK, but this turned into a bit of a nightmare.

Anyway, while I was stuck in the hellish void that is not owning a robot vacuum cleaner, like some kind of caveman, Ecovacs went and released the T20 Omni. It ticks all my boxes, on paper at-least, and for a change Amazon UK had stock and £300 off. So I thought I would give it a shot. Ecovacs is not a brand I have ever really considered much, partly because removing the pads to clean carpet (no longer an issue with this model) would have been a deal breaker for me. I haven’t been able to find a YouTube video or website review that isn’t basically a paid advert (many say they get sent them for free but the review is ‘their words’. Sure, but no one want to upset the companies that give them stuff to generate content with, anyway…). Even the Amazon listing had no reviews at the time of purchase, so maybe I’m mad, but for what it’s worth, here is my entirely unbiased initial thoughts after a solid day of testing. Hope it helps others considering this robot vacuum cleaner. 

Early impressions mostly good, maybe getting towards very good, but not ‘smashed it out of ballpark’ amazing. Yet anyway. It’s a lot more customisable than Roomba in terms of cleaning settings, so I’m still getting my head around what works best for my house and family, so as I say, these are first impressions and take that as you will. 

For a start, my Roomba J7+ just couldn’t get my golden retrievers hair off my low pile living room rug, at the most it just bunched it up into clumps so I could pick them up myself. No mater how many passes, or what I tried, it just didn’t have the power. Initially I was disappointed with the T20’s performance on the same rug, but after tweaking the settings for deeper clean, more passes and higher suction etc, the rug is now almost as clean as it is after a manual vac with my Dyson. So I’m very pleased about that, if it failed that test it was going back and I would have to go back the the drawing board for sourcing Roborock S8. 

It’s still a bit annoying how long it needs to achieve an acceptable clean of the rug, but as long as I’m not doing it my self I guess I don’t really care, it can do it when I sleep or I’m out at work or hiking. And my large-ish (by UK standards) house is mostly tile and oak wood floors, with a couple of low pile rugs. 

However, what I will say is that this is absolutely not a vac for people with mostly carpet, or even a lot of rugs and pets. If that’s your house, then don’t even entertain the thought of the T20, this isn’t the vacuum you are looking for. The settings required to achieve a just-about-acceptable carpet clean would kill the battery in minutes or take literally forever, if at all. Basically all you need to know is it’s next to useless on carpet, unless you have a very small amount you can hammer it with. 

Vacuuming wood, tile and slate floors seems more then sufficient, but what vac isn’t (unless you have deep crevices, which I don’t so can’t comment). The spinning mop pads work well, I prefer this approach to the pads most just drag around. Seems to actually clean, not just wipe. It also lifts them a good amount on carpet, no issues with wet rugs, which it does a great job of accurately detecting. 

The vac itself has no water tank built in. I’m not yet sure if this is a pro or a con. I can see this approach has a number of possible upsides (less to go wrong, more room for larger vacuum motors and batteries etc, less weight to carry around). The downside it has to keep going back to the dock to wash and wet the mopping pads (user configurable to 5, 10 or 15 minute intervals). The travel time and cleaning time adds considerable length to the cleaning, as it did this about 4 or 5 times. This could be an issue for some people, and may outweigh the benefits, especially if you wanted to mop every day. I plan once a week, so I’ll chose a day when the whole family are out all day and time is not an issue. 

Build quality seems decent, not quite as good as the Roomba in that respect, certainly not what I think it should be for the money, but yeah it’s fine, whatever. The dock is big but not quite as bad as I was expecting. Water tanks etc seem well made and easy to access and fill. Pad cleaning and drying works as advertised, but I will need much longer with it for a better idea. 

For those that haven’t used the Ecovacs app - it pretty meh. Not quite as user friendly as iRobot’s, but it has a lot more settings so it’s fair compromise. Not as good as Roborocks from what I have seen. But it gets the job done. I like the Apple shortcuts support, so I can create some home automation’s like not running and giving a warning when a door sensor detects a door it need access though is closed, more control over schedules, starting when the last person leaves the house etc. 

The battery seems to take forever to charge. But maybe the J7+ was smaller so it seemed quicker. I’m also perhaps being impatient with my new toy. I think it’s adequate though, unless you are planning to do a large house, including mopping and multiple passes. 

It’s probably not really fair to say much more at this point, without some more long term use. Straight out the box it did miss quite a few spots. It also simply refused to go a few places that even the stupid J7+ would, which just basically just blundered about, smashing into stuff and cleaning under my dining room table for example was a complete lottery. All my mid century furniture with its many narrow legs probably doesn’t help, but I was expecting a LiDAR based system to be a bit better at getting through stool legs and such like. It also didn’t get close enough to the walls quite frequently, leaving quite a bit of debris. Maybe the mapping will improve and there are a lot of settings that I think might help with it’s navigation, so I’ll see what changes and tweak can be made before making any definitive assessments. 

So it could be a keeper with a bit of work, but as I say, I need a few days with it. However so far it’s looking promising."
"Is the Roborock S7 MaxV Plus no longer sold/available in the US?After doing a fair bit of research, I prefer to get a robot vacuum with an auto empty dock, no go zones and the like the mopping is so-so (I don't plan on using it) but it ticks off so many other requests that I am having a devil of a time finding one. 

The official site is trying to push the Ultra, and Amazon and Target doesn't have it either (online)."
"Yo, Need Some Intel: Scoop on Buying a Second-Hand Robot Cleaner (Roborock or Others) - What Should I Keep My Eyes Peeled For?What’s poppin’, fam?

So, I’m on the hunt for a second-hand robot cleaner, specifically a Roborock or any other dope brand/model. I’ve been doing my homework and realized these bad boys can cost a pretty penny when bought brand spankin’ new. So, I figured I’d tap into the second-hand market and see what’s up.

But here’s the deal, I ain’t tryna get played. I wanna make sure I’m gettin’ a solid deal and a robot cleaner that’s gonna hold it down. That’s why I’m hittin’ up the Reddit fam for some guidance and wisdom.

If any of y’all got the lowdown on buying a second-hand robot cleaner, especially a Roborock or somethin’ similar, I’d appreciate your 411. What should I be lookin’ out for when snatchin’ up a used robot cleaner? Any specific features or specs I need to be keepin’ an eye on? And how do I know if the joint is legit and in good condition?

Here are a few questions I got brewin’, but feel free to drop any other tips or hacks:

	1.	What’s a fair price range for a second-hand robot cleaner like the Roborock? Should I be worried if the price seems too good to be true?
	2.	How crucial is it to know the age and usage history of the robot cleaner? Any common issues or maintenance drama I should watch out for with older models?
	3.	Are there any tests or checks I should be throwin’ down before sealin’ the deal? What signs of wear and tear or possible problems should I be scopin’ out?
	4.	Is it worth snaggin’ any kind of warranty or guarantee from the seller, considerin’ this is a second-hand buy? And how can I make sure I’m covered and not left hangin’?

I’m countin’ on y’all to drop some real knowledge bombs, share your own experiences, or dish out some solid recommendations. Help a homie out so I can make a smart move and score a reliable robot cleaner that won’t break the bank.

Much love and appreciation for all the help, my Reddit peeps! Stay fresh!"
"Shark RV1101 Will Not *Actually* ResetI’ve reset/power cycled everything - Shark, iPhone, AP, and UDMSE. 
I’ve opened the battery door on the Shark and unplugged it for about 15 min. 
I manually pressed the “Clean” button in the Shark and made it run until the battery died. 
I’ve removed my Shark from the app, then uninstalled/reinstalled the app. 
I’ve blocked/unblocked the MAC on my firewall
I’ve done all of this multiple times, for six hours yesterday. 

This started when I performed the (latest) factory reset on the app. Everything was “working” as in it was as crappy as usual, but even though Shark posts everywhere about how it continues to update and improve the map (LIIIES), that was not happening and it still, after 5 months of living in our new house, had not mapped the entire downstairs. 

The problem seems to be that the Shark retains my WiFi SSID/password no matter what. I don’t know how that’s physically possible if it has lost power, but as soon as I turn it on after a reset, the voice greeting is interrupted by the chime that means it’s connected to the internet and WiFi light comes on. The strange thing is that it doesn’t stay on, it blinks off and on. But not the fast blink you get when you hold the “Dock” and “Clean” buttons to initially connect - it’s a slow blink, on and off for ~5sec each. But when I look at it on my router, it shows the connection is stable with excellent signal. The problem is that I can’t remember whether or not it blinked like this when everything was working, but I am fairly confident the WiFi light was solid. 

If I proceed anyways the app says everything was successful, but I can’t control the robot with the app. Yet, if I press the physical “Clean” button, the app reflects that it’s cleaning, and all the normal options are available to me, but if I select one, let’s say I press “Pause”, the app shows that the robot is paused but the Shark ignores it and continues cleaning. If I kill the app and go back in, it shows cleaning again. Then, if I press the physical “Dock” button on the robot, the app shows it going to the dock. It shows the correct battery % and all that, so it seems there’s only one-way communication available - from the robot to the app, but not the other way around. 

I’m a network engineer and I am at a loss. The only thing I haven’t tried is changing the SSID password which might work, but I’ve also got 20 other devices on this 2.4GHz IoT network and I am not going to go around and re-connect everything just to get this POS working. 

I’ve seen one other similar post but not quite identical behavior. Is there a software bug or something right now? Does anyone know a secret way to wipe everything and start over? I’m about to take it apart and see if there’s a small battery on the motherboard for memory retention and remove that too but I don’t wanna spend another hour on this crap. 

I will never buy another Shark robot vac. This should be so simple, and they just cannot get it right. I could have cleaned my entire house 20 times over with the amount of time I’ve spent babysitting, troubleshooting, mapping, and resetting this thing. I’m about to throw it out the window."
"Review on Narwal FreoThis my first ever robot anything, and I'm so, so happy I bit the bullet and purchased!! We got it on a lightening deal from Amazon about a month ago, and have been running it about 1 to three times a week.

Our house is a fairly large 1 story, mostly tile with a bit of original wood floors in the hall area. We have two dogs with access to a dog door, and they are constantly tracking stuff in the house. They are also finicky about using said dog door (slight chance of rain?? Poopin in the house!)

Anyway, the first time I ran her (we named her Rosie 😁, I hope all the 90s kids on here get the reference) our floors were absolutely DISGUSTING. Like...ew. I did a whole house vacuum cycle first. It really did not bother me to check on her every so often and empty the vacuum canister, super simple in the app. She mapped out house extremely accurately and super fast. Did a great job vacuuming under our bed (better than I would have!)

Next I ran the Freo mode on just the living room (the most disgusting room) and she mopped that sucker THREE times! I had to refill the water and it took about 3 hours. The floor was SO clean though! I did one room a day in Freo mode because ours floors were so nasty and it was taking awhile.

Now we're in maintenance mode, so I do a visual check of the house for 💩 and have her vacuum and then mop, all on Strong mode. Takes about 3 hours start to finish. Then I do a thorough job of cleaning her out for the vacuuming areas, throwing the mop heads in the wash, emptying the dirty water and cleaning the tray. 

Cleaning the tray and the dirty water after EACH mopping is super important otherwise it will get nasty with gross bacteria. Don't ask me how I know 😬

The other important thing to watch for is cords, they are her nemesis. The first time she vacuumed our bedroom she went under my dresser (our TV sits on top) and ran over a thin speaker cord and it got tangled in her tire well and I ended up cutting the cord out. So now I'm super careful of triple checking the house for any cords before I start her.

She saves me so much time, super quiet and efficient. Love the Freo mode! I would highly recommend this unit to anyone with tile or wood floors. With proper maintenance I can see her lasting a very long time. I found extras of the brush heads, mop heads, and vacuum rollers on AliExpress, but not the soap. So, I'm willing to splurge for OEM soap on Amazon. The app is easy to use as well, and super functional with lots of customizable settings.

p.s. Did my dogs freak out the first time they saw her? Yes they did. I ended up following her around the house and throwing treats at the dogs to get them to stop barking at her, and now they literally don't even care about her!"
"This or that: Roborock Q5 for the better navigation and mapping, or Roomba J8 for the less-likely-to-tangle-with-hair brush rolls?I bought a Roborock Q5 and it arrived a week ago. I really like it so far, app is super intuitive and the navigation seems flawless. HOWEVER, I have two Ragdoll (long-haired) cats, and I have had to clean the fur that accumulates/tangles on the brush roll basically after every single run/every other run.

Given that cat hair is the reason I got the robot vacuum in the first place, I'm tempted by the idea of getting a Roomba J8 instead. According to the Roomba subreddit certain Costcos have it on sale right now for $550 (when I looked previously, it was $700 which is out of my budget). The dual brush roll system is supposed to be better at avoiding tangled pet hair. HOWEVER, I know I'd be giving up the LIDAR navigation, and I feel like I'd be bummed to lose that. Plus, I see mixed reviews on how well the j7/j8 can ACTUALLY prevent cat hair from building up on the brush rolls, and if I sacrificed navigation and ease of use, only to discover the j8 still involved having to clean the brush roll fairly often, I'd regret it.

Thoughts?"
"Roborock S7 or Dreametech D10 PlusI currently bought the Roborock S7 and I'm it's okay so far. I only need it for one floor as I live in a open concept house, with hardwood.

Currently I have a few problems with this vaccum. It's as if there is no obstacle avoidance. It bumps into everything fairly hard. Runs over wires. Pushes the docking station around. Runs into slippers and pushes them out of the way. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, but this doesnt feel like a premium vacuum bot. Also the mopping function, the mop doesn't get wet. Maybe I need to change settings.

Anyway, my question to you all is to know if the Dreamtech d10 Plus has much better performance? Or are they the same"
"What to choose? Please help a robot newbie!Tl Dr - what is a good robot vacuum/mop hybrid, that:
is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"
"Need help troubleshooting my Eufy 11sMy Eufy 11S recently started moving way more quickly and erratically, and it will also stop after running for about ten seconds. It does one beep with a non-flashing light, which, according to the manual, means that one of the wheels is stuck. I don't see any major obstructions around the wheels; I  also unscrewed the plates around the wheels and brushed out any dust. This made zero difference. 

Other things I've done:

* Cleaned out hair that was wrapped around the swivel wheel
* Cleaned the rolling brush
* Wiped the sensors with a dry cloth
* Beat the dust out of the filters (which are still fairly new)

Anything I'm missing? I've read some reviews that these models aren't built to last (I've had mine for about 16 months), but I'm really hoping there's something I can do to fix mine."
"PSA on Neato Vacuums. Just Don’t! I bought a  D8 from bed bath and beyond, $200. It came brand new unopened, when i first went to clean the brushes it had the warranty sticker pre broken for me. 

It was working ok up until recently now it just gets stuck in loop where it drives a foot or two forward, starts up everything, ramps it down, and just repeats that. The app does nothing until you force reboot it. 

I’ve had robot vacuums before, i had the Electrolux Trilobite and that was miles better than this, even my S9+ is better. How did Neato mess up this badly???


PSA FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY A NEATO VACUUM. DONT! A crappy bumper robot for $80 will out perform these wastes of money. They’re so bad it feels like a scam. It’s in a wide open space and it does this."
"Looking for a fairly basic vacuum that can handle a rug and hard floors. Advice?Hey all,  

Looking for a robot vacuum for downstairs only. Space is prob approx 750 sq ft.  

**Flooring:** Primarily laminate planks - but they're poorly installed (rental) and can sometimes get gaps that I have to push back closed. There's also 1 shag rug with medium/high pile with a non-slip mat underneath.  

**Features:** No mopping necessary. No self-emptying necessary. I would like if it could be scheduled, but if I have to start it when leaving for work in the morning, I can do that. I do want it to self-return for charging though.  

**Budget:** $350, but a bit flexible  

I'm just getting a little overwhelmed with all these different features I've been seeing and really just want one that can get on/off the rug with little to no issue. Feel free to ask questions if there's other important information I've left off.  

Please and thanks!"
"Need a robot Vac recommendations!I have a fairly unique situation, and I’m hoping someone here could help me! I’m trying to find a good robot vacuum, preferably under $300, with stupidly specific requirements:

1. The area it will be cleaning has no wifi, so a robot that can function without any cloud connection is needed.

2. The area is about 90% high pile carpet, so one that can handle this. For reference, my Wyze robot vac gets stuck when moving forward and could only go backwards, the front wheel was too short. I bought a Shark RV2002 from Walmart and that one is able to move forward but it kinda makes a snake path instead of straight rows. This problem probably isn’t fixable..

3. The area I need cleaned is fairly large, about 60x30 feet all open area. I would need a vacuum that could either cover that much area on one charge or is able to return to base then finish vacuuming. I called Shark and they said the RV2002 (and maybe all of their vacuums?) can only continue vacuuming if they’re connected to wifi, otherwise they just give up after returning home.

I’m like 90% sure this isn’t a solvable issue, but hopefully I’m wrong. Thanks in advance for anyone willing to help!"
"Recommendation - Too much pet hair!Can you guys please give me some recommendations, I have a fairly simple requirement list:

- Primary use will be to clean pet hair throughout the house 
- Entire house is one level, and all timber flooring
- Want to run scheduled when I’m away from home, although there will be a pet inside
- Self emptying preferred
- Will need to navigate in around the kitchen table and chair legs

I’ll still be manually vacuuming every second day, so won’t be fully reliant on the robovac. 

Currently looking at a refurbished Roomba i7+, but I think it could be too over the top / overpriced for my needs."
"Bissell A3 is almost 1/2 off, I bought one here are my thoughts.As of right now the ready clean mop head changing system is just $350.The TLDR is; I am extremely impressed and, this will replace my Roomba M6 .

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"
"Cheap generic vacuumsHi there,

I probably know the answer to this, but: 

- How bad are the generic cheap ""dumb"" vacuums?

I've seen a ""pyle pure clean"" - vaccum shaped object - for sale cheap locally

I recon even that will do my 500sq ft hard floor downstairs?

Thanks to another bargain local find, I have a roomba 700 series mercilessly collecting the fluff in my (carpeted) upstairs"
"Ihome NovaI don't see the Ihome Nova listed anywhere here, so throwing my impression of it into the lists.  I had an earlier, top of the line, very expensive robotic vacuum, and gave it away after about a yr. due to poor performance.  The Ihome Nova is a top of the line robotic vacuum with a very reasonable price.  It does an excellent job, where it can reach.  I have a few pieces of furniture it can't get under, but no big deal, I get to it about once a week.  The Ihome Nova is set to vacuum early morning each day and I never have to worry about my floors.  If you have deep grouted tile, it does a fair job but is great on hardwood floors.  I have two large german shepherds who are in a year-round shed mode.  Since getting this vacuum, I can enjoy clean floors and my dogs.  It also has a wet-mopping mode; I haven't used it yet.  It is so easy to mop the floors when the hard work of getting the debris up is already done. So 5/5 stars in my opinion."
"Shark AI Ultra wit Lidar has terrible object avoidanceIt keeps trying to climb these stool pedestals and gets stuck. Honestly not sure how it can’t see them with LIDAR because the pedestals are fairly large. 

On top of that, the app is terrible and creating rooms is buggy.

Definitely do not recommend this robot."
"Can I have my robot vacuum work at night while we're asleep but not come in our room and wake us up?Sorry if this is a bit of a random question, but I'm new to robot vacuums and I just wondered if I might be able to set up a system whereby the vacuum works at night while we are asleep, but when it's on the night schedule it won't come in our bedroom and wake us up… But then at other times when it's running on a regular daytime schedule, it will be allowed in the room?

Does that make sense? I guess what I'm probably asking is, do most modern robot vacuums that allow scheduling also allow you to have multiple schedules each with their own no-go zones?"
"Advice for uneven wooden floorsHello all, I'm considering a robot vacuum purchase for my new apartment. It's a fairly large and open space, but is built into an old mill with wooden floors. The boards re not all level or flush, and there are slopes in some spots.

I'd prefer not to buy a Roomba post Amazon acquisition, but if it's the best option I'll consider it. I've also been using full size and cordless Shark vacuums for a few years and like them, but I'm not married to any particular brand.

Open to any advice or suggestions!"
Anybody else having issues With Shark and Mesh wifi network?Without fail the Shark vacuums that were recently  purchased shuts down my Linksys Wifi network. I have factory rest them multiple times and it still occurs. These are the only devices on my network that causes this issue. Needless to say the units are boxed up for return. To give shark a fair chance I will contact them for any support that they may be willing to provide. For reference the two models that I have are the RV2520 and the RV2001.
"Best Vac for pet hair under 1k CADI am looking suggestions as to which robot vacuum is recommended for my situation.  I see a lot of posts asking similar questions but they all seem to factor in the ability to mop and clutter avoidance which are not really factors for me.

Some of the features I mention below may or may not be standard, or I may be calling by the wrong thing. I have never owned a robot vac before, so forgive my ignorance.

**Usage / Considerations**

* Mainly used on hardwood floors/tile, plus 2 low pile area rugs.
* Main thing being vacuumed will be pet hair.
   * 1 Medium Sized Dog - Short Hair - Pit/Boxer Cross - doesn't shed too too much
   * 1 Medium Sized Dog, Medium Double Coat - Heinz 57 mutt, sheds like a husky.
   * 1 Mid Sized Cat - Long Hair - Sheds like a beast
* Light Dirt - generally brought in by dog paws and the pit/boxer cross rolling around in it and coming inside.

**Features I desire**

* Price under 1K CAD if possible
* Auto Docking/Self Empty
* Being able to set ""no go"" zones
* Sensor for stairs - Stairs are generally blocked, but I have a teenager who likes to not close things.
* Pattern cleaning (not random all over the place waste of battery/time) I believe this is a mapping feature?
* I do not want to have to constantly detangle/unplug due to pet hair. I have no issues with routine maintenance, but I seen posts talking about having to do it after every cycle for some cheap models.

**Features that do not matter to me**

* Mop function - If it has it, cool. If not, I'm not concerned.
* Noise level - I have a loud teenager, and loud dogs. Noise is irrelevant.
* Clutter Avoidance (nothing on my floors I'm concerned about)

I have spent the last few days reviewing lots of websites, videos, reddit posts, etc. They all seem to encompass everything with focus on the Mopping feature, so none really stand out for my wants. Vacuum Wars channel did help a fair bit, but again, more focus on features I'm not concerned with.

I'd rather not overspend for features I don't need/want. That being said, I am sure there are lots of features I left out, that may or may not be important factors.

Thanks in Advance, and I hope I will be able to get the answers I seek."
"Seeking recommendation for vacJust moved into a 2/1 with about 730 feet of space, nothing major. We are going to put down a fair amount of rugs, mostly low pile but probably one high pile area rug. No pets yet but we may get a cat.


I’d prefer to keep it around or under $150 but I can go to $300 if it’s worth it.


Other wishes:
* I try to buy manufacturer refurbished vs new to reduce e waste, I know irobot, eufy, and roboroc all sell refurbished on eBay 
* prefer not self emptying because I don’t want to be stuck buying their proprietary bags
* open to a mop but not required


Thanks in advance!"
"For all hardwood floors and ease of use, X1 Omni vs Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra?Hey everyone, I've done a fair amount of research so far on both of these vacuums and the general consensus I get is:

Omni:

- Better for mopping(and less work since it dries the mopping pads for you unlike the roborock?)

- Not as nice for homes with carpet(not relevant to me)

- App/support is much worse than Roborock

Is this fairly accurate and do you believe I'd be happy with either models? 

The Omni having a worse app does sound concerning, but honestly, how bad is it?
Is it truly terrible like some people have stated or is it just a bit worse/less polished than Roborocks? 
Does it still have most of the same features?


The fact that the Omni can dry the mopping pads for you seems to be a major advantage there that isn't talked about too much from what I've read.


I can pick up an Omni today at Bestbuy but would have to wait weeks for the Roborock to get here, so that's another minor bonus"
"Most cost effective vacuum and mop combo.My house is single level, 1500 sq feet. All tile or laminate. I have a dog and a cat which both shed a good amount (I have to vacuum like twice a week or I see balls of hair rolling around) and a fairly dusty backyard because I live in AZ. I want something that’s an established brand so I won’t have to worry about poor customer support or the company flopping. Lastly I want something that’s as self sustainable as possible (auto-dock and empty, doesn’t have to be reset and remapped too often, reusable mopping pad, parts/batteries don’t need to be replaced too often) was thinking about waiting for prime day and pulling the trigger but also want to know if now is a good time to buy or if there’s something coming out that’s worth waiting for/will drop the prices of good things that are already out. I’ve heard about using slick deals as well and wondering if anyones had luck. Price isn’t the issue just want it to be cost effective."
"Just moved home to take care of Mom - looking for a robo vac!My wife and I just moved in with my 92 year old mother to take care of her. She has always been a stickler for house work and that hasn't changed, so I have been thinking about buying a robot vacuum cleaner... so I don't have to do it any more. :-)

I have some fairly specific needs and questions. If anyone has time to answer any of these, or make a recommendation, that would be awesome!

* I LOVE robots and ""gadgets"". Looking for something a bit... techy? (Roborock's Lidar navigation sounds cool!) Being able to return to the charger is a must. The self emptying bags are neat, too, but not a requirement. I'm also intrigued by the cameras.
* Mom's house is probably 2500 square feet, main floor and furnished basement. (So it might be nice to have a robot that can support multiple floors?)
* We don't currently have any pets
* Most of the house is carpeted (low pile) but the kitchen is tile
* The wife is very skeptical about the whole thing, so my budget is probably around $500

**QUESTIONS:**

1. My Mom's vision is pretty good but my wife is worried that the robot might trip her. I said that we could probably have it run at night. Has this been an issue for anyone?
2. If we don't get a robot with a self emptying bag, do you need to clean/empty the robot after each clean?
3. I've heard that some robots destroy tassels on area rugs. Are some models worse about this than others? Here's a pic:

[I put down 2 quarters and a penny for scale](https://preview.redd.it/pkzo61t60iw81.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12b2e6c8f0800a827178925ab849ce1eb95bfbf7)

Here are a couple of the robots I'm currently looking at:

**Roborock S6 MaxV**

I like that it supports multiple floors, has Lidar navigation, includes a great app with lots of features, and has a camera to help avoid cords and things on the floor.

**Shark IQ Robot Self-Empty XL R101AE**

I just started looking into this robot due to it's self emptying bin. Not sure if it supports multiple floors. I don't think it has a camera.

**UPDATE: Roomba J7+**

Based on feedback I have just started looking at the Roomba J7+. I like that it seems to work better on low pile carpets, but the main appeal is the self-emptying feature. Really like the sound of that. :-)"
"robot vacuum recommendationsHello all, fairly new to robot vacuums here, however I do believe I have the basics down. I currently have a lydsto R1 which took a s**t after 45 days, 15 day after the 30 day return window with Amazon.  It refuses to stay docked, it docks itself then leaves and repeats 3 times then says that it can't connect to the dock to charge and to check the connection. I have cleaned the vacuum, reset it, remapped it, updated it, unplugged the dock for 2 hours, etc. Nothing seems to work, and of course the manufacturer is giving me the run around so that's out of the question and the seller is no where to be found. Thankfully, after multiple attempts to speak with Amazon i have been able to get to someone who granted me a full refund for the vacuum. It sucks because it has a lot of cool features; docking station with a dust bin, lidar, moping, 5200mah battery, 2700pa, and for $300! 

With that being said, I will get another vacuum and am willing to pay more for something reliable and of quality with good customer service. 

Must haves are a lidar system or vslam, simply put, something that efficiently mops in good patterns. And something with a dust bin and mops ideally. I'm a single dude, no kids, no pets, living in an apartment with 1 bedroom, mostly hardwood floors except for the bedroom which has carpet. 

I'm torn between roborock s7 maxv ultra or the roomba s9+ but damn that price tag! I could go on a mini vacation for that kind of money! If anyone has a recommendation I'm all ears."
"Open Source Robot Vacuums That Are Good For Daily Use?I'm leaving reddit and I hope to escape from social-media walled gardens upon the wings of [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub).  I will consider moving to a server running [Kbin](https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/wiki), which - from the user's point of view - is an interface to [""federated"" social media](https://github.com/shleeable/Big-List-of-ActivityPub).

“Federation” describes a way in which servers communicate with one and other. The best-known example is that of e-mail:  one can have an email account on an AOL server, and communicate with a user whose account is on a Gmail server. Some servers that are thought to push out spam are blocked or have their mail sent to ‘spam’ folders, but they nevertheless can all communicate.  Gmail, Yahoo, Protonmail, AOL and so-forth all have different programs with which the user (us!) interacts, and they might present that email information in slightly different ways (displaying email chains as ‘conversations’ for example).  In the same way, social-media servers that communicate with one and other using ActivityPub have different programs with which the user interacts.

Some programs that service-providers can run on their server look a little like Reddit, and might let you mark the data you share with markers (metadata) that lets people display and interact with the data in a similar way (Eg.: Kbin or Lemmy), some look more like Twitter and mark the data you share in ways similar to Twitter (Eg.: Mastodon), and there’s even one that’s trying to help users share video in a way that makes one think of YouTube (Eg.: Peertube). Fundamentally, these all permit interaction with one and other through activitypub.

One can even host one’s own server (Eg.: Nextcloud, a program that runs on a server to function as one’s own cloud, lets the person who runs it install an ‘app’ that one can federate with any other ActivityPub servers open to intercommunication).

Many programs that use ActivityPub for federated interaction are written by folks who realise that things published on servers – even private messages – often get shared beyond the realm in which the author expected (hopefully for the joy and glory of the author, but sometimes not).  I think because of this, messages sent from a user on one server to a user on another are sent in-the-clear; they aren’t encrypted in any way, they’re just a post like any other, except being marked for the attention of someone specific rather than for the attention of all, and it’s up to us as the users to think carefully about the words we push to others.

There is a sterling list of alternatives to Reddit on [r/RedditAlternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/comments/1467a5s/find_alternatives_for_ourselves_megathread_third/).

How did I think it best to go about this?
- I [downloaded all the posts on reddit I'd ""saved""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/887lo3/just_thought_id_share_my_strategy_for_downloading/).
- I used ""[Power Delete Suite](https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite/#installation)"" and rather than just delete all my posts, have replaced them with text.  Everything published online ought to be regarded as likely permanent, and Reddit especially, as [people](https://www.reddit.com/r/datahoarders) like to take [snapshots](https://socialgrep.com/datasets) of [as much data as possible](https://www.vice.com/en/article/gy3az9/this-data-hoarder-is-downloading-the-metadata-of-roughly-10-billion-youtube-videos) that’s published  ""in the clear"" (I.E.: anything that isn’t publically accessable).  Some folks have described problems with ""deleted"" posts mysteriously *re*-appearing after they deleted their accounts…   Regardless of the cause, I hope I might reduce that risk a little by editing those posts.  R/datahoarders might have tips on alternative methods still functioning after the API-use price is introduced (~$20m at the time of writing according to a dev that made an app to help the blind use reddit; they have sadly had to stop developing their app).
- There's a guide to downloading all the data Reddit have collected directly from your inputs [here](https://12ft.io/https://danielrosehill.medium.com/how-to-backup-your-data-from-reddit-f12934fabbfe) but note that Reddit may take a month to process that request.
- Remember most of one’s interaction with the internet is reading.  Subreddits [all have RSS feeds](https://www.howtogeek.com/320264/how-to-get-an-rss-feed-for-any-subreddit/), and can easily be accessed by an [RSS reader app](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=RSS+reader&lang=en).  [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) is a great way to get android apps that people have made openly so anyone willing to learn can understand how they process your inputs and data, and that others have freely distributed, for the glory of free speech.  Sorry for sounding like a hippy there; I know, I know, it’s a slippery slope to bicycle lanes and communism!  A modicum of private thought, and free speech is a very fine thing, though.
- I encourage people to share the text of this post if they find it useful, in order to give others a way to think about how they make and put data on the internet in social media.

To be sure, Reddit still holds, or has doubtless sold on (and thus can never delete), hoofing amounts of data.  I shan’t hold a public opinion on a business seeking profit; over time as the art of gathering and selling data has been refined, I’ve tried to read what little about it is within my understanding.  If my small tokens of communication, my upvotes and downvotes, the time I spend looking at things, and what things I look at, what things I shy away from, and how I type and compose my thoughts, are the grains of sand that make up the beach from which they intend to profit, it’s up to me to decide where I place those grains of sand in the future.  In the immediate timeframe I will use a mathematics-oriented mastodon server (I’ll let you hunt it out if you’re curious!) because maths is fairly apolitical, useful to learn about, and a good, communicable, basis for understanding things.  Go in peace, siblings of the internet, and if in doubt, consider “What Would Tim Berners-Lee Do?”.

P.S.: I’m not sure what I can link to that might be useful to most readers, but there’s a lovely Indian lecture on sharing wisdom with one and other [here](https://youtu.be/UiJmITcZTQY), and because financial awareness is important to most people, and because I’ll only be watching r/bogleheads from afar, here’s a link to Bogle’s [Little Book Of Common Sense Investing](https://archive.org/details/littlebookofcomm00bogl) - he started the Vanguard fund, and r/bogleheads explains his investing philosophy, which is very simple and elegant.  If anyone’s looking for a good charity to which to make a tax-deductable donation, I hope you might find the [internet archive](https://archive.org) is a noble and worthy candidate.

"iRobot j7+ review video + write up [OC]Hey everyone, we're a little late on this one, but we've finally released our review of the J7+. Check it out on Youtube here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFuuRpJQaic&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFuuRpJQaic&)

There are a few things of interest about this robot to me, in particular.

\- I believe that they're relying more and more on the optical floor tracking sensor - the one used on the i3, more than the front facing camera.  As a result, it's a little more clumsy to watch than other options and takes a few full cycles to create its map.

\- Once again, iRobot haven't increased the suction power so it's now quite far behind some competitors.  They haven't published a suction figure, but I believe it's around 1800pa.  Despite this, it's probably still the best or thereabouts on carpet due to the signature dual-roller set-up.  The dual rollers don't make quite as much difference on hard floors or with bigger items like leaves, but the suction is still sufficient.

\- The vSLAM camera is now mounted on the front of the robot and looks forward, rather than at the ceiling.  As a result, the J7 is the first iRobot to have object detection for things lying on the ground.  It was pretty good - it missed all our dog poo tests and while it caught some cables, it didn't actually get stuck.  Only criticism is that in some cases it was slightly too sensitive and avoided some spots it shouldn't have, but that won't really matter if you're using it regularly and is a fairly common issue with object detection.

\- The new design and base is very cool.  The base is a lot smaller than any of its competitors and is a much better use of space.

Feel free to ask any questions... I'd love if you asked them on Youtube rather than here to help the algorithm ;) I only check the comments here every few days but I'll try answer any questions.

Currently working on our S7 MaxV Ultra review... expect that within the next week or so."
"So just a general discussion IRobot's dual brush patent ends in May 2023So I've been recently on a robot vacuum kick and been doing a lot of research about them. I realized roomba's dualbrush design is extremly good and I thought it was a shame its patented. 

Well good news the patent expires pretty soon. Supposedly May 2023 so we might be seeing a lot more innovation and efficiency from other brands from here on out."
"Narwal T10 problemsSince buying the Narwal T10 last year, I've been increasingly frustrated with it.

More specifically:
1. device goes offline randomly and needs to be reset, even though my wifi is good
2. device manages to gets itself stuck around barcelona chair legs
3. requires remapping when moving to a different floor, instead of storing multiple maps
4. iOS has not been updated for 8 months, seems like an abandoned product
5. requires manually changing the attachments to switch between mop/vacuum mode. To be fair, I knew this before buying but underestimated how annoying this would be.

For the price ($900) I personally would not recommend it at all."
"Best robot vacuum and mop with self empty for hardwood floors and pet hairHello Robot Vacuum and Mop Gurus,

I am looking to buy our first robot vacuum and mop for our 2 level approximately 2000 sq foot house- we are looking to move to about a 3000-3300 square foot house(when we are able to find one in this crazy housing market) so would want to get a vac and mop that is able to handle at least that amount of space- mostly hardwood floor and tile in bathrooms and kitchen with some area rugs. We have a 7 month old Labrador retriever puppy so need the vacuum
to be able to clean pet hair. 

I have read ratings and reviews  on several
Websites - tomsguide, pcmag, rtings, wirecutter, realsimple, usatoday, goodhousekeeping, nymag, vacuum wars on youtube, etc. and they all recommend different products with some overlap. I did review a few posts on this and other reddit forums as well but would like to know what the end users like now. I am still very confused and would really appreciate your input based on your personal experiences and knowledge. Is it true that some sites are driven to push certain products more by sponsorships from their manufacturers than by actual product performance?

I went ahead and ordered the roborock s7(for $450 from amazon) the roborock e4( for $220 from amazon) - both without the auto empty bin - and the deebot t8 aivi with the auto empty bin  (for $599 from Costco) so I wouldn’t miss out on the holiday sales- though I am still not sure which one of these would best suit my purpose. I got the e4 based on the review on rtings.com, the t8 aivi based on vacuum wars and pcmag and the s7 based on pcmag’s review - probably listed elsewhere as well. 

Please recommend the best/a fairly good and reliable combined robot vacuum and mop with an auto empty bin that is available in the market today. I am located in the US and am able to return all of the 3 vacuums that I bought if theres a different one that you believe performs better. I am willing to spend upto $600 max  $750 if it really makes sense in terms of what the product delivers as compared to a cheaper one out there. 

Is the technology still evolving or are there products out there which consistently clean well and require minimal maintenance and upkeep? Based on what i have read, I don’t believe  any robot vacuum is able to completely replace a regular corded vacuum entirely but is definitely helpful as a secondary cleaning tool with a regular vac being needed to be used every couple of weeks or so- is that your experience as well?

Thank you so much and have a nice weekend."
"Shark IQ XL self emptyingHi everyone! I'm looking for some answers about my new robot. 

I have been wanting one for quite some time, I have a great Pyrenees who sheds his body weight and I just can't keep up with the floors. I researched a ton and found my preference was the shark due to it being bagless and overall the reviews seemed pretty good. I've only had it for a day ish, so I know it needs time to learn my house etc.. 

It does a good job scooping out the tumble fluffs from corners which is great but the brushes fling around larger objects on my hardwood - e.g. a cheerio. Is this fairly common?

It didn't really do a great job on my shag rug which isn't too disappointing because pretty much nothing works well on it. Are my expectations set too high? Is this more of a maintenance vacuum rather than a full clean type thing? 

I haven't found the best spot to put the base yet - does the self emptying still scare the crap out of you? Haha the first time this happened I screamed and my dog went running as fast as he could. 

Thanks!"
"Should I buy the Dyson V11 or a Robotic Vacuum to get out of chores?I live in a 1200 Sq. Ft (110 sq. m) single floor apartment in India. All rooms are tiled and don't have carpets.

I have a budget of 50K-70K INR (~670-950 USD) for purchasing a new vacuum. My home gets a fair amount of dust from outside and I'm finding it really hard to keep it clean. My depression also doesn't help with doing my chores regularly. I'm finding it hard to motivate myself to clean my apartment (or at least my room) during the weekends.

I have heard quite good reviews about the Dyson cordless vacuums via Twitter. I'm especially draw to Dyson because several folks said they find it much easier to do 5-10 minutes of vacuuming every day because of how cordless vacuums need much less ""mental"" effort to get started. I can somewhat relate to this as I also own a mid-level corded vacuum and I find myself being put off by the thought of vacuuming because of the ceremony involved - the corded vacuum needs careful maneuvering around the house, the wire gets tangled on the various object lying around etc).

This has made me think about getting a Dyson V11 Absolute Pro which retails around 50K INR (690 USD).

However, I am not sure if I'm better of purchasing a robot vacuum since my main goal is to avoid the mental pressure of not doing my chores and procrastinating frequently.

I'm conflicted between the two choices and need some input. Here is what I see as the pros and cons:

1. Dyson seems to be an established name in India, at least compared to Robot Vacuum brands. EcoVacs and iRobot are the only two premium brands I could find on Amazon and both of them seem to have only a couple of service centers for whole of India (and not the city I live in).

2. As I said, I've seen many people on twitter posting positively about how Dyson has helped them make regular vacuuming fun. For Robot Vacuums, I can only find reviews via Amazon and they are either very positive or very negative and **majority of complaints seems to be about poor customer service when things break within few months of purchasing**. To be fair, I've also found bad reviews for Dyson, but very few are about customer service and lack of replacements.

3. EcoVacs and other brands of robot vacuums come with a 'mopping' feature which seems attractive to me. Not sure if this is just a gimmick though.

4. Robot Vacuums seem to need the auto-empty base to be worth investing as the solution to 'eliminate chores' . This pushes the cost to the higher end of my budget. The Dyson, while still at the lower end of the budget, will not eliminate the ""chore aspect"" completely.

5. Dyson seems to support handheld mode for cleaning surfaces like tables, bookshelves etc. Robot Vacuums won't work here.

Given the above issues with poor customer service in India, I'm not sure if it is worth investing in a robot vacuum at this point. I'm looking for something that will serve me for at least 2-3 years without too much maintenance cost. At the same time, I want to make sure this investment will help me break my depression cycle by keeping my home clean with minimal effort.

Should I bite the bullet and buy a robot vacuum? or should I just get a Dyson? Let me know your thoughts :)

Thanks in advance!"
"Looking for recommendation for robot vacuum to deal with extreme amounts of pet hair.We have a [newfoundland](https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Newfoundland-standing-outdoors.jpg).  Needless to say, we have a fairly extreme amount of pet hair to deal with in our home.  

We previously had a Roborock S4 vacuum.  I really liked the navigation, mapping software, and how it cleaned, but it just wasn't able to handle the pet hair well.  I was having to clean the brush daily and replace the brush every couple weeks due to how much hair was getting wound around it while cleaning.

We got a Roomba i8+ after that and with the rubber rollers it does a better job of dealing with the dog hair.  I only need to clean it out 1-2 times per week and replace the rollers maybe every 2-3 months.  The auto-emptying dock is also really nice so I don't have to empty the bin constantly.  My problem is that the navigation and mapping software are terrible compared to Roborock.  It takes the roomba 50% longer to clean our house and it constantly misses spots.  I'm also unhappy with how it's built since one of the wheels just fell off the hub so now all it does is spin in circles.

Anyone have recommendations for a robot vacuum that's built well, has good mapping/navigation, and can deal with extreme amounts of pet hair without constantly needing cleaned out and/or brushes replaced?"
"Purchasing AdviceHi there,

 

Hoping for some purchasing advice. I’m looking to purchase a robot vacuum and mop. While I don’t want to waste money, I don’t mind spending a bit extra to get what I want. I’m hoping to keep the price around $1,400 USD (or less!).

 

Things I’m looking for / use case:

- Self-emptying base for vacuuming

- Gentle around furniture (as little “driving full force into my dining room table legs” as possible)

- Good at cleaning around edges / baseboards

- Able to set keep out areas

- Avoid cords (otherwise the floors are fairly free of any obstacles)

- For mopping, something that can have the cleaning solution in the tank / device

- Good level of customer service for problems

- Able to order replacement parts (specifically that ship to Canada)

 

Use case:

- No pets / pet fur

- Mostly will be cleaning dust/crumbs/etc.

- Laminate floor with two area rugs (5’ by 7’ each) in one room

 

Things that don’t matter:

- Whether it’s a single device, or two devices (one to vacuum, one to mop), it doesn’t matter. If two devices, the same brand would be nice, but I’m not opposed to them being different brands.

 

I believe this should cover the majority of the relevant details. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

 

Thanks,

 

Tyler"
"3rd day of my Eufy Robovac and I’m already emotionally attached to it. The story so far:At first I programmed its schedule for 4 times a week. I saw its next swallow routine was in 2 days. But damn I felt lonely without it running, so I just reprogrammed its schedule for once everyday. Emptied its tank before letting it go on its merry way. Will make sure to empty it fairly often.

It’s scheduled for 10pm cause usually I won’t be out during those hours, and it’s inevitable it will get stuck on my chair’s base, so since I’m home by then, I can get it unstuck fast. Yesterday it got stuck twice on the same chair’s right leg, and today it did it again, same leg, same chair. I facepalmed heavily. Goddamn it Spleens.

I feel like it judges me since it will follow me to clean up the area I will spend my time around. I live in a studio apartment so sometimes I will get on my murphy bed and just lay there, it will start focusing on picking up dust and pebbles around and under the bed, then I get up for a drink in the kitchen, it will start following me there to pick up whatever it thinks I will leave. I feel shamed by it. But I love that darling robot so much already.

I feel like Spleens knows I just got home not long before it began running, so first thing it did was go to the entrance of the apartment and start swallowing the pebbles my boots left, very handy.

Through the app I named it Spleens, it cleans.

Apparently the 25C is not the type to map the house, but damn, it feels like it really does know where it goes, because it very often will attack the same damn chair’s right leg, what a goof.

Tell us your fun robot vacuum stories, and even share us the name you gave yours!"
"Is Amazon insurance worth it on robot vacuums? (I just bought it, thinking of cancelling)As you'll see in my other post, I bought an Ecovacs Ozmo 920 at the tail end of Cyber Monday.

I even bought the bloody 3-year insurance for it from amazon (£30), as I hear a fair bit about robot vacuums almost never lasting to the 3 year mark.

Query: If I keep the Ozmo, is it worth keeping the Amazon 3-year insurance? I can cancel it within a couple of weeks. 

Usually I think bundled insurance is a waste of money, but this might just be an exception? 

I'm good at keeping documentation nowadays and confident I'd be able to find the paperwork if the thing pukes its guts on my floor in 2 years time."
"Comparing lower budget options: is LIDAR worth it? Or a mop option?Hello, I've recently fallen down the rabbit hole of robot vacuum videos and reviews. I had no idea there were so many options and functions nowadays. I'd really like to get one, but I'm having trouble deciding which one and hoping you all could help with any personal experiences or comparisons you could give.

A little background: we have a smaller, moderately cluttered house with hardwood/tile floors and a couple rugs. We have two large, messy dogs who love to track dirt inside, and a 10 month old baby who drops food when she eats, and of course random crumbs and dirt from daily life. We both work full time and between that, taking care of the baby, dishes, laundry, and cooking, we really don't have time to sweep and mop as much as we should. I'd say ideally our house should be swept, vacuumed, and mopped every day.

I've been looking at robot vacuum options and so far these are the main points I'm not sure about:

I don't know whether to look at a dedicated vacuum or a vacuum/mop combo. At first I was looking at the combos because why not? But after reading a lot of reviews it seems like most of them don't really mop very well, and it's more like dragging a wet swiffer pad across the floor without rubbing out dirt. So then I was thinking I could just get a robot vacuum and a robot mop separately. the iLife Shinebot looks awesome.

But I don't know if maybe the not-so-great mopping function is still good enough to be worth it on the combo options. Also, some options seem to vacuum and mop at the same time, while some options you have to switch out parts and do one at a time.

LIDAR looks awesome mainly because of more organized navigation, and the ability to create ""no go zones"" and designate cleaning areas in an app. This seems especially important if I get a mop combo because I don't want it mopping our rugs. But even without that, it would be nice to keep it away from our TV cords and dog bowls etc. But most LIDAR options are more expensive.

These are the vacuums I've been looking at and would love input:

* ILIFE V8S: $150 on Amazon for the next 3 hours. Vacuum/mop combo. No LIDAR. Good reviews. I believe this company just has a suction port without a brush which is good on hardwood but not carpet/rugs.  
* 360 C50: $160 with coupon. Vacuum/mop combo. No LIDAR. Seems very similar to the ILIFE V8S.  
* 360 S5: $200 with coupon. Vacuum only. Cheapest option I've found with LIDAR. Good reviews. No-go zones, mapping, etc. Not sure how it is with hair tangles. This is near the top of my list due to the LIDAR at this price point.  
* Roborock E4: $210 with coupon. Vacuum only. No LIDAR. Stellar reviews for this brand in general.  
* Wyze robot vacuum: $227. Vacuum only. Next cheapest option with LIDAR. 
* ILIFE A10: $230 on Amazon for the next 3 hours. Vacuum only. Also has LIDAR.  
* Roborock E4 with mop: $240 with coupon; additional mopping option for $30 more than the other one. Not sure if worth it.
* ILIFE A10 with mop: $270 with coupon. Same deal.

Any thoughts or experiences on these options? It seems like a lot of things are on sale right now and I really want to jump on it!"
"Recommend me a good robot vacI have had a Neat D80 for many hears, i’ve had my fair share of issues over the years but overall it was a decent vac. I’m ready to move on as i’m sure they have come a long way by now.

I am leaning towards a Roborock S6 Max or S7 but am really open for any suggestions.

Notes to help you help me.

- don’t care too much about moping feature as pretty much my whole house is wood (laminate) flooring that i am picky and would rather manually mop (using a ZEP product).
- I have a Husky (lots of fur) I will be running this basically every day
- I have a few rooms that are carpeted but see low traffic, but would like something good at carpet either way.
- Would be nice to have some sort of a sensor for dog 💩 (as far as i know only the S6 Max can do this with its cameras?)
- Not a deal killer but would like the option of a self empty station (Like the RR S7 offers now)
- budget (5-$650)


Open to options…thanks for advance"
"Vacuum to handle Pyrenees fur + clutterHello, I am looking for suggestions on a RoboVac.  I have 2 fairly significant obstacles for the vac to work around.

One: I have 2 dogs, a Great Pyrenees and a Golden Retriever.  For those not familiar the Great Pyrenees fur is very fine, long, and tends to collect in tufts. Our handheld vacuum (Shark Apex Duo Clean) has trouble with fur wrapping in roller,  so I assume only a select few RoboVacs will excel here.

Two: Clutter.  I have 2 young kids who like to leave toys in random areas throughout the home. Ideally we would pick these up before vacuum runs, but that's not practical.  So we're hoping for something with great obstacles avoidance to survive the gauntlet.


Does anyone have suggestions on Robos that will excell in both of these areas?  Initially I was leaning towards N8 Pro+ for the obstacles avoidance, but then learned it struggles with brush tangles. The Roborock S7+ is intriguing as well, but I worry about obstacle avoidance, and the price as it stands is a bit steep (unless it's truly worth it).

I appreciate any input.

Thanks!"
"Shark (RV101AE?) have most of the kinks resolved?I have been considering getting a robotic vac for awhile, I have an iLife that is pretty basic but at least gets dog hair w/o choking - thing is I want more :D

I came across the Shark self emptying vac, which seemed much more affordable to me, was supposed to be self emptying, and the base didnt require a vacuum bag (as a vac bag would fill up in just a day or two with all the dog hair we have).

The main thing I had in mind is self emptying and having it understand when it needs to be emptied which when i looked last year i think it was shark had a fairly common issue of not emptying when it should. I have never used mapping before so I am thinking its not a deal breaker if that is still being worked out.

So I was thinking of getting the RV1002AE (sorry mistyped in the title), the latest that self empties, bag-less dock, has a Self-Cleaning Brushroll, and Recharge & Resume - are those features more or less working well with this version and/or is there a model that does this better?

Thanks in advance!"
"Looking for Robot Vacuum recommendationsHi All,

I am looking for a good robot vacuum that doesn't burn a big hole in my pocket. A few details about my needs are -

**Home** \- 700 sq. ft. 1 Bedroom apartment in the US

**Flooring** \- Hardwood flooring in living room. Bedroom has a carpet

**Cleaning requirements** \- Mainly hair, dust, small food particles

**Price range -** $200-$300

What I am looking for -

1. Something that is fairly hands-off. I am not looking for anything too sophisticated as that would surely be expensive. But I am hoping that I don't have to intervene too much and get the robot out of difficult corners if they get stuck there
2. My hope is pretty simple. All rooms are rectangles and so is the furniture. The robot vacuum cleaner would need to go under the bed and under the couch though
3. The basic features obviously - Powerful vacuum, good capacity dust bag (I have absolutely no issues cleaning the dust bag)
4. My previous handheld vacuum required continuous cleaning of the brushes as hair and dust would get stuck there and cause them to jam. I don't know if thats avoidable but would be great to have
5. Some degree of integration with Alexa/Google so that I can voice control it. Not a deal breaker though

(4) and (5) aren't deal breakers so if I am getting a solid device for a good price which has all the basics then I am good with that.

Some options I found on Amazon. What are your thoughts? Thank you so much

Any other good devices that I did not consider?

"Shark IQ RV1001AE first impressionsWe just received our Shark vacuum.  After seeing a lot of horror stories we were pretty nervous, but for the first two days its been a good experience.  We went with the Shark for the bagless auto empty, self-cleaning brush roll, and was able to pick it up direct from Shark for \~$355 after tax.

We are coming from a Bobi Bobsweep which was absolute garbage.  It could not navigate thresholds from tile to wood, pushed hair around, and finally had a 80% battery degradation after a year.  I was surprised to see it is still being sold at Sams.

This does appear to be the updated model with the floor camera.  I ran it overnight with a few lights on and again this morning to let it build its map.

We have black legged furniture (stools, table/chairs, buffet) and while it does bump and rub, its very light taps.

It has been able to climb on our thick floor rugs in the kitchen and our dark color shag living room rug without triggering any cliff sensors or getting hung up.

The self cleaning brush roll seems to work ok.  There was a little hair spooled around the axle but less than the Bobi would collect, but we were impressed how much Basset/Pyrenees hair it had extracted.  We have floor vents that are fairly sharp metal, and I do see some tearing of the rubber brush, so that may not hold up very well.

This is our usual vacuum day and it looks on par with what our Dyson gets.  I'm sure the Dyson extracts more out of our living room rug so I plan to go over that with the upright.

Hope this helps folks have a realistic expectation of the Sharks.  It seems they have made some strides with the updated model and software/firmware.  We have 90 days to trial it but we're pretty happy right now especially for the price.  I really wanted a LIDAR bot but this seems to work OK and the mapping only took 2 runs.  The only thing I'd like to see is them adding multi-floor mapping."
"How hard is it to 'Reshell' a robo vac?I'm fairly inexperienced with robot vac tech so frogive me if this is a stupid question, but how hard coded are the dimensions of a robot vacuum? Can I buy one, gut the actual tech and transplant it into a different shapped hull without seriously affectting the collision detection? 

I've been looking at DIY kits but they seem to be largely geared at education style pieces without any serious functionality, so if anyone has any advice I welcome it."
"Ihome Autovac Nova vs Shark IQ?Looking into getting my first robot vacuum, planning on spending less than $500. Love the idea of self-emptying. The ihome looks great on paper and is on sale at Walmart right now for $269 and there are a lot of sharks on sale locally for similar or less money in new or like-new condition (probably first gen). I'll be using the robot to control dog hair on the main floor of my house, which is less than 1000 sqft and mostly hardwood and tile.

Anyone had experience with the ihome? The Shark seems very popular but I've seen some mixed reviews, with the most complaints centered around mapping and navigation. Adams Tech Reviews on YT has tested both and had positive things to say about the ihome (after they made a couple revisions), while he absolutely despises the shark, regardless of the version. Vacuum Wars had good things to say about both.

Another consideration is the app experience. I'm on Android. Most of the robot vacuum apps have pretty trash user ratings, while Sharks app is actually fairly positive.

Thoughts?"
"Will Shark IQ eventually work, or should I get something else?My partner and I decided to get a robot vacuum; and to start with we got a Deebot Ozmo 920. The thing worked great (mapping was great, it did a good job cleaning, and the app worked well) for a little over a week, then the little laser sensor quit. I reached out to their support and they said to ship it to them for repair, my partner found a bunch of reviews online saying it was a common problem so we just returned it.

So now I picked up a Shark IQ with the self emptying station, and so far it is very disappointing. It hasn't built a map in the app yet, and every time it runs, it goes over the same small area multiple times until the battery is almost dead, then seems to have a tough time finding its charging station. It runs into furniture fairly violently, tries to drive over the bases of chairs, and the onboard dustbin is full long before it returns to the charger on its own (if it ever finds it). The last 2 runs the dustbin was so clogged (dog hair) that it apparently couldn't self empty. Also it sounds like even if does build a map, I can't specify ""no go"" areas in the map like I could with the deebot (can anyone confirm this)?

The house isn't very large, and is mostly hardwood floor with a couple of rugs, but I do have 2 dogs so there's a fair amount of pet hair. If the mapping function would work and I could tell it to clean 1 room, then go empty itself, this Shark might work, but so far it seems like it just gets lost.

Has anyone gotten one of these to actually map, and if so does it then start working well? If you think I should get something else, any suggestions for something (preferably around or under $500)? I did like the 'direct suction' option on the Deebot as then it had no roller to get tangled up with dog fur). I'm still undecided on whether the mopping or self emptying features are worth the extra cost."
"Ecovacs T8 vs Roborock S5 Max as explained by Chinese reviewersI know there's a lot of english videos comparing these, but I thought it would be interesting to check out what reviewers in China think, since these were made there and are fairly popular. (Oh also, forgot to mention, while the Chinese Roborock T7 is very similar to S5 Max, the key differences is that T7 has more advanced route calculation methods, 2 more cliff sensors, pressure sensor on the LIDAR part. Also it has different wall sensors apparently)

"Loopy, but much improved rv1001aeJust for shits, I took my RV1001ae and put it down slightly hidden from the dock and told it to dock.

It spent the next 40 minutes going everywhere except straight ahead. It went up and down the hall, into a couple other rooms. It appeared, at times, to be following the wall. It hit every room at least twice except the room the dock is in. It seemed to be actively avoiding it as it would nose in, spin once, then leave.

It did, eventually, find the dock. Even though it took so long, I'm fairly impressed. I had hoped it would look around, find itself on the map and just dock, but at least it got back on it's own eventually through sheer dumb luck.

I was nervous as hell buying this thing due to some of the horror stories here, but it seems they've fixed a lot. My map was complete in one run. The thing is quiet enough that I let it vac my bedroom while I'm sleeping and rarely notice. I would love to be able to schedule full power vacuum runs, but have to settle for normal for now. Again, it's fast and quiet, I can do a full power run during the day if I feel it's warranted.

I've had a couple times the bin didn't fully empty, but I have dogs, and it was thick fur reinforcing itself I had to pick out. 99% of the time it's been flawless. I haven't had to clean the brushes once in over a hundred runs.

The main problem is the no-gos aren't working. I have my kitchen no-goed, but it still ends up in there, so back to magstrips. That and the stupid camera mapping. I used to run at 3am, but this thing needs light. LIDAR from now on, but it works well starting at dawn-ish.

The map works fairly well though. I can send the bot to any room and it will go, clean and return. However, if I choose multiple rooms (without doing the whole house) it can get confused and lost.

I do miss sections. With my D7 I had 3 sections within the living room likely to have midday problems so I could quickly just clean that spot. Haven't found a way with this yet, but it's fast and quiet so not a huge deal, I just do the room.

The maps need more granularity. I had a heck of a time making a 'room' for my hallway. I couldn't get the thing skinny enough and it lapped over into other rooms. Then suddenly it just worked. 

Also slightly miss spot cleaning but again, it's quiet and fast enough, it's only slightly missed.

So beats the hell out of the original Roomba (I had 3), the Bissell carpet/floor bot and the rv750. If it had LIDAR and a slightly larger bin it'd beat my D7, but it would likely cost much more.

The bin, at first, is a problem (had to stop and empty it every 5 minutes on first run), but if you run nightly as expected, it's less of an issue.

Not bad for the price."
"How much do robot vacuums insist on phoning home?I want to buy a robot vacuum. I've been looking at both **Roborock S6** and the **higher-end Roomba** models. I think these are best for our home in terms of their physical characteristics and vacuuming features.

However, for reasons I cannot share, it would be highly inappropriate if the robot vacuum I owned uploaded data about my home to the cloud. I can isolate it on its own wifi network to prevent it from learning too much about my computer network, but I also **do not want it to share e.g. the physical layout of my home with its manufacturer**. Is this something they would do? Can it be prevented?

**Edit for future readers:**

The Roomba robots are supposed to have better privacy options, so with a price difference of $450, the question becomes ""Are you willing to sell your floor plan to China for $450?""

As far as selling your information goes, that's a fairly good price for it, in today's market. But it's still a tough choice when money is tight-ish. Still have not made a final decision."
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ecyszkgf381.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c3622533c2030046dbef7725b811ae4c8140468

 

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Could someone recommend me a robot vacuum?Hi, I'm looking for a relatively cheap robot vacuum I could use in my house. Here's a few things about my house:

**Home** \- around 100 m2 (6 rooms)

**Flooring** \- Mostly carpets ranging from 2mm to 10mm. The kitchen has tiles and the bathroom has PVC flooring. The issue is: I have doorsteps ranging up to 25mm in some places (on the carpet close to the doorstep it's around 20mm).

**Cleaning requirements** \- A lot of hair (I have a long-haired dog), some food particles and crumbs (also dry dog food), tobacco, sometimes some sawdust and dirt.

What I'm looking for:

1. Obviously the basic stuff: powerful robot, fairly big dust bin, also it needs to be reliable.
2. A fairly cheap robot (up to $283, maybe even $300).
3. My furniture can fit a robot no bigger than 10,5 cm (about 11 cm between the furniture and the floor), so it cannot exceed that limit.

So I was considering these three robots:

\- **iRobot Roomba 697** (I've heard very good things about Roombas, but the random vacuuming pattern might be an issue),

\- **Neato D4 Connected** (it has a big brush which would be great for carpets, my doorsteps might cause a problem though; apparently only 15mm is recommended for Botvacs, can Botvacs climb onto higher obstacles than 15mm?),

\- **Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum Pro** (it's a little too expensive, the dustbin is the smallest out of these 3 \[0,5l\], but my home is already full of Xiaomi products).

Right now I'm thinking about getting the Neato Botvac D4 Connected (because of the big brush, LIDAR and big dustbin), but I've read mixed reviews about it. The iRobot Roomba 697 most likely wouldn't be as good in cleaning the carpet as the Neato and I've also read mixed reviews about it, but it's the cheapest.

Maybe there are some other robots that I didn't consider?

Btw: Are used robot vacuums worth it? Maybe I could buy a used one and save some money?

What do you think?"
"No mention of Kobold?[VR200](https://i.imgur.com/aftlHuc.jpg)

Hey all, I just stumbled upon this subreddit and had a look around, but could not find any mention of the Vorwerk Kobold range, I have a VR200, but I have heard of the newer model VR200.

We bought our kobld in 2016, and still use it heavily to this day. It's a fairly big place, hardwood floors and a few rugs around, no carpet. He have a fluffy cat and a long haired dog so lots of dust bunnies running around the place.

It does take all day with 3 to 4 charge cycles to clean the whole house. I would say 8 hours all up, getting to all rooms. I empty the dust container on each charge cycle. Also between cleaning episodes I will flip it over and open it up to take out the brush to clean, I can't believe where hair ends up 

When we first got it I didn't realise i had to clean the brush, so about a year later we had to send it back for repairs. The bearing bushes are a really soft plastic that melt with some friction. We have had to send it back about once a year for this sort of maintenance. Each time it has not cost us anything as they honoured it under warranty, though it's been over 12 months now and things are looking great 

When we bought it wifi was not yet enabled, but lately there have been software upgrades so that it can be controlled from an app, though unfortunately on my model there is no room mapping, only on the next model, the VR300 

Overall we are really happy with it, it does an amazing job on the floors with all the hair and dust, rarely gets stuck, and very entertaining to the baby.

Hope this adds something.
Happy robotics.

P.S. we named the vacuum Greta"
"Analysis-paralysis Before PurchaseOk, so my wife and I had a Roomba 650 for a couple years but sold it. It never seemed to do a great job, regularly got stuck under furniture, and overall was fairly ""dumb"". With no app, house mapping, etc we were unable to set custom routines or ask it to go clean a room. Furthermore we have been seeing the auto-empty features slowly get adopted, and think we want to get a new one. We (my wife) like the Roomba S9+, but I am really starting to toy with the idea of the Ozmo T8 or T8 AIVI. However I have a couple questions.

1) Does the ""D"" shape of the S9+ really clean the corners better than an ""O"" shaped vac?

2) Are the T8/T8+ and T8 AIVI not good, I noticed they weren't in the side bar?

3) Considering the T8+ is about $200 cheaper than the T8 AIVI and Auto-Empty station is it really that much worse? With 2 Dogs, being able to identify and move around dog toys, water bowls, not get stuck under furniture, etc. If the object identification is that much better on the AIVI then it would be worth it to me. 

4) Our floors are hardwood with low-pile area rugs, does the Roomba really clean that much better than the Ecovacs?

5) Are there any other options I should be considering? Or is there about to be any sort of vacuum robot revolution where next year's vacs will be significantly more capable than this year's?

6) Which option is less likely to rise up and murder us in our sleep when the AI becomes self-aware?"
"Evovac deleting accounts?Do people have issues with the evovac home app and it randomly deleting your account? 

Every now and then I can log into the app and connect to the robot. I can’t recover my password as it doesn’t recognise it. It will let me create a new account under the same email address as the previously used. 

What’s funny though is the robot will use the map created originally and the schedule I set up originally. But apparently that account doesn’t exist. 

I’m fairly new to robot vacs so wondering if this is some sort of bullshit I just need to put up with. Thanks,"
"DEEBOT T8+ Save a Custom Routine?I am frustrated with the Ecovacs Home app.  I have a fairly large open concept home.  After the mapping completed, I was not able to divide up areas easily.  My kitchen, great room, and breakfast area are all open areas.  I was able to separate the breakfast area from the kitchen.  I want to be able to run a custom clean just around the island of my kitchen and do not need to clean the complete kitchen and great room area.  I cannot find anywhere to save and add favorites for these type routines.  I have read in some of the other apps (Roomba, etc) that this is possible.  So far I like the T8+ and it’s cleaning power and length of time it can function, but the app is really horrible from an intuitive standpoint compared to other home automation apps I use."
"What about latest 360 and Tesvor bots?All latest 360 [models](https://www.amazon.com/stores/360+Smart+Life+Direct/page/FC881FA3-BC5E-442F-AF07-B401DAD78555?ref_=ast_bln), especially S5 (2020) and S7 Pro, seem like Roborock S4 and S5 Max clones, but with a little improved spec and for substantially less money. Same with [Tesvor S6](https://www.amazon.com/Tesvor-Navigation-Auto-Charging-Cleaner-Compatible/dp/B085TPFCW8/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=35AY8H4901F9J&dchild=1&keywords=tesvor+s6&qid=1600263248&sprefix=Tesvor+%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzOFBFTTY4UEo1V0g4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDg4MzgyNEdVTjJMTEtJTkFRJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzMjc4MzkxTkRNT1EyN1dKVjhWJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) which seems like Roborock S4 on steroids but at $250 price point with a coupon. Both 360 and Tesvor have mostly positive reviews on Amazon but there're  just too few of them and all of them fairly recent. Almost nothing on the web except of occasional raves about 360 S5. 

So nobody buys those? Or they immediately fall apart on delivery and all their specs are a lie? Are these companies just a joke ready to disappear into a thin air without support?"
"Help Needed! I have a theory that black baseboards are not compatible with robot vacuums.We have a fairly open floor plan and black baseboards.  In June we bought the ECOVACS Ozmo T8 AIVI and after 3 months it still could not keep a map or return to the dock.  The map would sometimes be great and halfway thru cleaning the entire map would shift to an angle?  The cleaning was great, but very frustrated with customer service.  Returned to BestBuy this past week and bought the Neato D7.  This robot cleans ok, very loud, and gets stuck way more than the ECOVACS.  The Neato also cannot find it’s dock, it even went right up and touched the dock, then drove away still searching.  So......I am wondering if the fact that we have black baseboards is confusing the bots because the charging docks are also black?  The Neato is not the model for us and will be returning as soon as I go back to BestBuy, what should I do?"
"Shark RV1001AE Wifi. Please HelpWe bought this on black friday was super excited as our old robot vac was a dumb one. Setup went fine the first day connected to wifi cleaned the house. Next day cleaned until it found some dog poo(was not happy with the dog). Cleaned on day  3 no issues. Day 4 lost wifi connection.

I did the turn it off and back on wouldn't reconnect so I added the both back into the app it found the wifi no problem and I could control it through the app again. Later that night it was disconnected again. I did the new bot again since that was the only way to get it to reconnect to wifi and again it was connected in the app for about 30 minutes then it drops off. I have gone through this the past 2 days now. Called shark they took some information and said it had to be escalated. I haven't heard back.

Wifi is 2.4GHz other devices have no issues staying connected. I have my 5GHz band as a separate SSID. A fair amount of recent reviews on google play show similar incidents recently with the wifi disconnects but no solutions.

Additional oddity, the robot is scheduled to run daily at 10am and when I look in the app it has a history for today. Says it started at 10:46 went to the dock at 11:29 cleaned 291 sq ft. However it still says can not connect to robot in the app??"
"Neato D7 vs Roomba 976 vs something else?Fialry new to Robot Vacuums, but not to IoT devices, so which one would you choose?

I originally looked at the eufy G30 until i realised it would have trouble mapping in the dark.

I'm after a hoover that has logical dynamic mapping, can work in the dark and is 'fairly' intelligent. We're a family of 4 with 2 kids under 3, so its a common sight to have the odd toy lying around. I'm after something that will cope with this, navigate around it and not get completely confused once that toy has moved the next time it comes out to clean.

I love how comprehensive the Neato vacs are from a software side, the ability to add virtual barriers in the app, and mark out zones is something i'm looking for. Its not practical to mark out magnetic strips or similar physical devices to block off areas of our home, put simply my eldest would move them, haha. I understand that the Neato is laser guidance only, so it can get abit lost if its base is moved or not where it remembers it was, causing it to want to remap, but im unsure how much of a problem this is in practice?

The Roomba seems to lack some of the neato software smarts - reserved for the even more expensive line of cleaners: but i think i read it has both laser and image guidance, but its hard to get much information on this?

Infact, i find almost every manufactures listing scarce of enough details to really see the differences in these cleaners.

I like the idea of being able to clean multiple floors by moving the vaccuum, but in practice i envisage it will only be used on our ground floor, which is predominantly wooden flooring and tiled flooring.

Google home and IFTTT integration is a must, and ideally would like HomeAssistant integration as i have one of these running in the house.

Any experience, suggestions or help on this would be greatly appreciated,

Cheers - Ben"
"Roborock Accessories QuestionI have a Roborock S-6 which does a great job. The problem I have is accessories. I can't find OEM parts from manufacturer and all third party I've seen have reviews saying that the filters fit poorly and that the main  brush-roller causes error messages that roller brush is jammed. Several say that they put the old brush back on & the unit cleans the house without problems. Has anyone found ""good"" accessory parts & if so from whom did you order them. My unit is fairly new but I didn't want to wait until parts are needed to order them & find out that they don't work properly. Thank you!!!"
"2 Year Tune-Up on Deebot N79sAfter 2 years of service, our Deebot N79s was basically not functional anymore.  We run it on average of probably 2-3 times per week on the top floor of our house (probably 600 sq feet of flat-loop carpet).

&#x200B;

Would regularly get Main Brush Malfunction errors even right after cleaning or replacing the brush, the 20-beeps errors indicating the battery was bad and most of all, when it was running, would make a mechanical knocking noise most of the time.

&#x200B;

I was annoyed that a product focused on convenience was becoming more and more inconvenient with all the babying it needed to keep running, so I was determined to give it a tune-up.

&#x200B;

Battery Replacement:

This was super easy.  $30 on Amazon and 2 Phillips screws had the 20-beep error gone for about 2 minutes worth of work.  I recycled the old battery.

&#x200B;

Recurring Main Brush Error:

Fixing this was 2-fold.  First, I figured the error is based on either temperature, or electrical load on the main brush motor.  First obvious fix was to clean and lubricate the motor and bearings.  This should probably be done fairly regularly, especially if there's a lot of pet hair around.  This helped, but didn't make it go away completely.  My other 'fix' was realizing that the suspension of the wheels was making it sit pretty low and also un-evenly... pushing the brush down into the carpet a little too far.  I fixed this by putting some screws in the casing that limit how far the wheels can travel.  One for each wheel let me level everything out and raise up the brush to keep it from bogging down so much.

I noticed after doing this that the result of keeping the brush-speed high, it picks up A LOT more in a single run than it ever did before.

&#x200B;

Knocking Noise:

I noticed this comes in a bit more as it's been running for a few minutes, so figured it was also related to heat building up somewhere.  Lots of people who have this noise say that it goes away after replacing their main brush, but this wasn't the case for me.  Once I'd taken apart the 'gearbox' to clean/lubricate the motor and realized it had a toothed drive belt, I figured that it HAD to be the belt slipping after getting warm.  Even after the above tweaking to reduce the load on the brush, I would still get the knocking noise halfway into a session.

Thankfully, they left some dimensions printed on the drive belt, but it was still a PITA to find a replacement.  For anyone who is looking, the belt was marked ""S2M134"" which means it has 134 Teeth and the 'pitch' (tooth spacing) is 2mm.  I measured the belt at 5mm wide.  Luckily these belts get used in 3D pritners and small robotics.  I found a Gates brand (big, name-brand for belts) 134-2MGT-06 replacement belt....134 teeth, 2mm pitch and 6mm wide.  This finally solved the noise issue!

&#x200B;

Just put everything back together and I think it's running better than new!  No errors, no weird mechanical noises and with the new battery it runs for a solid 40-50 minutes.  Very glad it's all working happily again, but I wanted to share, especially about the slipping belt.

Cheers!"
"House full of women!I’m kinda on the fence with purchasing one of these vacuums. With the wife and three daughters in the house, I’ve cleared more than my fair share of hair from tub/sink drains and vacuum rollers over the years. I love gadgets of convenience but I’m scared I’d spend more time dismantling one of these only to have to cut hair off the roller with a razor blade. How do these things hold up to long strands of human hair?"
"New Haier t370 Showing No Signs of LifeMy sisters bought my mother a Haier T370 for Christmas. They got a decent deal on it on eBay, which is possibly questionable in itself. It was new when it arrived and it worked fairly well for about 2 weeks. My mother is pretty old school and kept unplugging the base, which I don't think is the best way to use it. Lately it has stopped working. No noise, no lights. My sister had the power cord plugged directly into the side of the machine saying that the base won't work when the battery is dead, and I think it briefly came back, but now it's completely dead.

The buttons are all touch buttons, so I'm wondering if there is a reset button or another way to reset it. The manual is vague and unhelpful. I took the battery out and cleaned the contacts, and now we have it plugged in charging (hopefully) again. I'm hesitant to take the bottom off and I don't really think I would know what to look for if I did.

Any help would be much appreciated, there is very little information on this specific brand online and I'm certain it should have lasted more than two weeks.

Thank you!"
"Vacuum Bot recommendation student householdDear redditors,

can anyone recommend a budget friendly (<500€) vacuum bot? Maybe a model that has been working great in your own household.

We have a 65m^(2) appartment, no pets, girlfriend that tends to lose lots of long hair.

The following aspects are important:

\- reliable

(We thought about getting the Dreame L10s Pro for example but because of the mopping technology there seem to be lots of cases of mop or water tank malfunction, which doesn't make automation a lot of fun)

\- good vacuum performance

\- decent mopping would be neat, but I'd be ok if this is out of our price range

\- station is a nice to have but not necessary.

&#x200B;

Some of our candidates are w10 ,l10s pro, z10 all from dreame. But it doesn't have to be this specifiy brand.

Unfortunately right now the roborock s8 base model is cheaper than the s7 where i live, otherwise I'd go for a s7, but my girlfriend is not happy with the price tag.

&#x200B;

Thanks a ton in advance."
"Got a few candidates for a robot, could you please help me pick one of them?Hi, could you please help me pick a robot? It's supposed to be a gift for my father. 

1. PROSCENIC M6 PRO, price ~ 730 PLN

2. Xiaomi Viomi V2 PRO, price ~ 1080 PLN

3. ILIFE L100, price ~ 1180 PLN

If you have other options I'm all ears, but my budget is limited to about 1000 Polish zloty (~240 American $)."
"Someone here to help wtih my decision?Hi it’s my first time buying a robot vacuum and I’ve been really doing a lot thinking to choose the right one for me.
First of all I live in a 3 bedroom apartment of around 60 square meter (or 650 square feet I guess) with a friend of mine and we both each have our own cat (one is a ragdoll🥲), we have a middle sized carpet in the living room and everywhere else is wood floor.
And we don’t have that many furniture but we have some pet stuff on the floor quite everywhere. Also I’m kinda tired with vacuuming all the kitty litter and fur lying all over the floor while I have to study for a long time during the weekdays.
In this situation I narrowed the candidates down to four ones and I hope anyone could pick the right one for me or maybe rank them. Thanks in advance🙂

1) Shark AI ultra self-empty (Av2511 something model)
This one is currently $300 on Amazon 
And it has all the cutting-edge(?) functions like Lidar mapping, auto emptying, and I heard its basic functions are as nice as others
Alhough I see bad reviews of Shark brand and its apps quite often, I think this one has everything that I need and has the best price.
Finally I also like that it doesnt have a dust bag

2) Dreame Z10 Pro
It has all the functions the first one has and even better, I saw that its obstacle avoiding ability is quite good. But quite more expensive ($480?) and considering customs and shipping costs🤯 since I live outside the US… And although I really like that it has mopping function but I don’t think I’m gonna use it that much… finally I saw some reviews that its basic picking up function could have been better.

3) irobot J7+
Many reviewers compliment this product and I saw that it has very nice obstacle avoiding technology. And I heard irobot’s two brushes thing is quite good at carpet cleaning and hair tangling. It is good in overall and cheaper than other high-end robot vacuums. Yet it’s way over my budget.

4) Eufy L70
It had that Lidar thing and basic functions also seemed to be nice enough. Its only drawback is missing autocleaning function I guess.. Though it also has mop function(which again I don’t really know how often I will use..) and I think cheapest of all these four

So which one of these four do you guys recommend? I’m about to buy Shark one but I would like to consider many things before buying. Thanks for reading a long post!"
"Open Source Robot Vacuums That Are Good For Daily Use?I'm leaving reddit and I hope to escape from social-media walled gardens upon the wings of [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub).  I will consider moving to a server running [Kbin](https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/wiki), which - from the user's point of view - is an interface to [""federated"" social media](https://github.com/shleeable/Big-List-of-ActivityPub).

“Federation” describes a way in which servers communicate with one and other. The best-known example is that of e-mail:  one can have an email account on an AOL server, and communicate with a user whose account is on a Gmail server. Some servers that are thought to push out spam are blocked or have their mail sent to ‘spam’ folders, but they nevertheless can all communicate.  Gmail, Yahoo, Protonmail, AOL and so-forth all have different programs with which the user (us!) interacts, and they might present that email information in slightly different ways (displaying email chains as ‘conversations’ for example).  In the same way, social-media servers that communicate with one and other using ActivityPub have different programs with which the user interacts.

Some programs that service-providers can run on their server look a little like Reddit, and might let you mark the data you share with markers (metadata) that lets people display and interact with the data in a similar way (Eg.: Kbin or Lemmy), some look more like Twitter and mark the data you share in ways similar to Twitter (Eg.: Mastodon), and there’s even one that’s trying to help users share video in a way that makes one think of YouTube (Eg.: Peertube). Fundamentally, these all permit interaction with one and other through activitypub.

One can even host one’s own server (Eg.: Nextcloud, a program that runs on a server to function as one’s own cloud, lets the person who runs it install an ‘app’ that one can federate with any other ActivityPub servers open to intercommunication).

Many programs that use ActivityPub for federated interaction are written by folks who realise that things published on servers – even private messages – often get shared beyond the realm in which the author expected (hopefully for the joy and glory of the author, but sometimes not).  I think because of this, messages sent from a user on one server to a user on another are sent in-the-clear; they aren’t encrypted in any way, they’re just a post like any other, except being marked for the attention of someone specific rather than for the attention of all, and it’s up to us as the users to think carefully about the words we push to others.

There is a sterling list of alternatives to Reddit on [r/RedditAlternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/comments/1467a5s/find_alternatives_for_ourselves_megathread_third/).

How did I think it best to go about this?
- I [downloaded all the posts on reddit I'd ""saved""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/887lo3/just_thought_id_share_my_strategy_for_downloading/).
- I used ""[Power Delete Suite](https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite/#installation)"" and rather than just delete all my posts, have replaced them with text.  Everything published online ought to be regarded as likely permanent, and Reddit especially, as [people](https://www.reddit.com/r/datahoarders) like to take [snapshots](https://socialgrep.com/datasets) of [as much data as possible](https://www.vice.com/en/article/gy3az9/this-data-hoarder-is-downloading-the-metadata-of-roughly-10-billion-youtube-videos) that’s published  ""in the clear"" (I.E.: anything that isn’t publically accessable).  Some folks have described problems with ""deleted"" posts mysteriously *re*-appearing after they deleted their accounts…   Regardless of the cause, I hope I might reduce that risk a little by editing those posts.  R/datahoarders might have tips on alternative methods still functioning after the API-use price is introduced (~$20m at the time of writing according to a dev that made an app to help the blind use reddit; they have sadly had to stop developing their app).
- There's a guide to downloading all the data Reddit have collected directly from your inputs [here](https://12ft.io/https://danielrosehill.medium.com/how-to-backup-your-data-from-reddit-f12934fabbfe) but note that Reddit may take a month to process that request.
- Remember most of one’s interaction with the internet is reading.  Subreddits [all have RSS feeds](https://www.howtogeek.com/320264/how-to-get-an-rss-feed-for-any-subreddit/), and can easily be accessed by an [RSS reader app](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=RSS+reader&lang=en).  [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) is a great way to get android apps that people have made openly so anyone willing to learn can understand how they process your inputs and data, and that others have freely distributed, for the glory of free speech.  Sorry for sounding like a hippy there; I know, I know, it’s a slippery slope to bicycle lanes and communism!  A modicum of private thought, and free speech is a very fine thing, though.
- I encourage people to share the text of this post if they find it useful, in order to give others a way to think about how they make and put data on the internet in social media.

To be sure, Reddit still holds, or has doubtless sold on (and thus can never delete), hoofing amounts of data.  I shan’t hold a public opinion on a business seeking profit; over time as the art of gathering and selling data has been refined, I’ve tried to read what little about it is within my understanding.  If my small tokens of communication, my upvotes and downvotes, the time I spend looking at things, and what things I look at, what things I shy away from, and how I type and compose my thoughts, are the grains of sand that make up the beach from which they intend to profit, it’s up to me to decide where I place those grains of sand in the future.  In the immediate timeframe I will use a mathematics-oriented mastodon server (I’ll let you hunt it out if you’re curious!) because maths is fairly apolitical, useful to learn about, and a good, communicable, basis for understanding things.  Go in peace, siblings of the internet, and if in doubt, consider “What Would Tim Berners-Lee Do?”.

"Does a Scoopa replacement robot exist?I've had 3 second-hand Scoobas (380/390) that serve greaty to the mission of keeping our floor clean. I don't regreat buying them, but each lasted only few months. After repairing and replacing several parts they get back to life for few months and then another part needs fixing/replacement.

I guess that evidences why iRobot decided to stop selling them, and I can see how difficult can be to build cleanin robots that mix hydraulics, electronics, pumps, etc.

I also gave a try to several mops (Braava, attached mops to vacuum cleaners, etc) which I don't think are worth. They serve their purpose to do superficial cleaning, but nothing compared to the work that the Scooba perform.

Do you think there is a real candidate that can compete with the old Scoobas? I've seen a similar product( iLife W400) which doesn't get much publicity, and my feeling is that the new iRobot mops wouldn't perform much better than the old Braavas (came from Mint)"
"Shark IQ Self Emptying Vac- AV1010AE or AV1002AE ?I'm currently looking at some Shark IQ models and I'm not sure which one to get. I'm focused on Shark because of the self empty aspect. These are the only models I could find that fit by budget (under 600 CAD on [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca), has to be them because I have a a gift card to use).

I've identified AV1010AE (XL) as the ideal candidate though I'm not sure what's the difference between the AV1010AE  and the AV1002AE aside from the fact that it's not an XL and the AV1002AE seems to come with boundary strips.   
Unless the AV1002AE is also an XL but amazon doesn't have XL in the title?

"Help with an old, chopped-up 2-story home? What to do with this Narwal Freo?!I did some research and reading on this sub, and watched other videos. 

  
We recently purchased a narwal freo for $1,000 during one of their sales.  And now... I am at a loss of how to set it up to reach all the areas.  And haven't found the company's support to be able to think creatively about this problem. 

&#x200B;

We live in a pre-1900 old 1,500sqft, 2-storry farmhouse.  

First floor: kitchen where the dock is now, and then 3-inch step-up to living/dining room and 1st-fl bathroom.  

Second floor: primary bedroom same 3-inch step-up to a rabbit warren of a hallway, a 2nd bathroom with a transition the robot probably won't like and 2 small bedrooms.  

&#x200B;

I read on here about making a ramp, which I'll do for the 1st and 2nd floor transitions.  But what to do about the 2-stories?  Do I carry the dock upstairs when I want to clean the 2nd floor?  Right now we have the dock on the 1st floor bc the kitchen needs to be cleaned almost daily, rest of the house stays pretty clean.  2 adults live here, no pets, some child visitors.  Unless we have people over for summer outdoor hangs, shoes off, etc.  

&#x200B;

I'm disabled and tire very easily, and just trying to figure out an easier way to keep things clean, and I'm realizing maybe the narwal isn't it?  The house is so small and broken up with no storage (pre-1900 style) so I didn't want to buy separate vacuum and mopping robots, there is nowhere to store anything. No cleaning or broom closet, no mudroom, etc. 

&#x200B;

But do I keep the narwal on the first floor and get a 2nd expensive vacuum for the small 2nd floor - that seems crazy.  I thought maybe I could just pick the robot up and bring it back to it's base when it needed to self-clean, refill, recharge etc, if it was on the 2nd floor, but now I don't know... that doesn't seem like it will work. 

It all feels crazy! I would love some guidance from this expert community.

"I’m having trouble finding a robot vacuum that checks all my boxes, help appreciated.What I am looking for:

1.	Self emptying 
2.	charging dock
3.	bagless 
4.	dual vacuum and mop WITHOUT needing to manually add or remove the mop attachment 

So far the Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 meets almost all of this except for mopping you need to manually flip the vacuum over and attach/detach the mop attachment which kind of defeats the purpose of a robot vacuum; I want to be able to set it and completely forget it, interacting with it basically never and only emptying the dock when full or close to full. 

Any ideas?

The Roborock S7 also comes very close except it’s not bagless and since most of the bags are proprietary I’d rather avoid basically having a subscription to a vacuum."

The Ecovacs is currently on sale for $1640 AUD, while the Roborock is priced at $2499 AUD.

"Please help choosing between Roborock Q5+, Roomba J7, or .........Hey guys. I've researched more than I'd like to admit and still confused on what to get. My house is 60% hard floor, 40% carpet. Own 1 small dog. (never poops/pees in house. Just sheds a little)

Features I'd like to have:

1. Be able to spot clean a section of the house from the app. For example, if kitchen bar needs clean, I can spot clean a specific part of the map from the app.
2. robot avoid objects in floor. IE underwear/clothes, shoes, etc. Also want to identify on the map areas that robot can't go/bump into.
3. auto dispose bin would be great but not absolutely essential.
4. built to last. They are expensive and I expect it to last 10 years+. Only plan to buy extra brushes and battery replacement etc. down the line.

Roomba J7 pros:

1. better carpet cleaning, object detection for small objects like cords. Apparently roborock isn't as good as J7 bc it doesn't have camera. Easier to get replacement parts?

Roomba cons:

1. for price of q5+, doesn't have feature #3. Supposedly still has horrible mapping (bumps into objects all the time like the old school roomba did/do?). Doesn't use lidar.

Roborock Q5+ pros:

1. better mapping, more features. value for price (feature #3)

Robo cons:

1. doesn't clean carpet as good due to dual brush.

&#x200B;

I'm leaning towards the roborock. Seems like most people agree it's significantly better overall. I think the only reason I'd go roomba is for better carpet clean and maybe easier to get parts down the road. I'm torn and would love some help.

I've also looked at  Dreametech D10 Plus,  Shark - AI,  ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T10+. None of them seem to be as good as name brand roomba or roborock. I'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks!"
"Help me selecting a robot vacuum, please?As the title states. 

I hate vacuuming, even though I have a small vacuum, dragging it around and not getting well around furniture really irritates me. Also, not getting under the bed, being stuck behind a corner, you get the jist. 

What I want from a robot vacuum is not much, it has to be able to get around my apartment and it has to be able to SEE where it's going, not BUMPING like it's a moron, doing the same square 5 times. 

In that aspect, mapping my apartment floor with no go zones (around my coffee tables and my nightstand) would be 10000% a must have feature. 

A bonus could be a waste bin and mopping feature. 

In the vast amount that is available, I have no clue where to look. 

I tried one before, but it was a bumping vacuum and it couldn't make sense of the room, and it wasn't bright enough to go around my coffee tables. 

I'm willing to spend 250-550 euros. I might be able to stretch it to 600. I don't need a high end model, just a smarter one than a bumping vacuum.

I've looked at a few, but I just can't make up the difference between brands. 

If it helps, I'm situated in the Netherlands. Maybe someone has ideas. 

Thanks in advance, also for reading this wall of text.

"[HELP] iRobot robot 960 can’t go back to its dock on its own.Hi all,

I have this iRobot since Dec 2019 and for a while now it just struggles to go back to its dock, it keeps going out, spinning around moving the dock and then gives up when it’s out of battery. Even if I put it back manually sometimes I have to fiddle with it for 30 seconds to make it stay on the dock. Irritating. I never want to use the thing. 

I’ve also noticed recently a lot of the dust gets brushed underneath to only the left side of the robot sensor which does touch the dock.

I’d like to point out that I have thoroughly cleaned all sensors (dock included)…

Do I need a new one? Has she seen her best life after nearly four years?"

"Need help troubleshooting my Eufy 11sMy Eufy 11S recently started moving way more quickly and erratically, and it will also stop after running for about ten seconds. It does one beep with a non-flashing light, which, according to the manual, means that one of the wheels is stuck. I don't see any major obstructions around the wheels; I  also unscrewed the plates around the wheels and brushed out any dust. This made zero difference. 

Other things I've done:

* Cleaned out hair that was wrapped around the swivel wheel
* Cleaned the rolling brush
* Wiped the sensors with a dry cloth
* Beat the dust out of the filters (which are still fairly new)

Anything I'm missing? I've read some reviews that these models aren't built to last (I've had mine for about 16 months), but I'm really hoping there's something I can do to fix mine."
"What to choose? Please help a robot newbie!Tl Dr - what is a good robot vacuum/mop hybrid, that:
is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"
"Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni - early review & initial thoughtsAfter the disappointing iRobot Roomba J7+, I had intended to go all out and get myself a Roborock S8 Pro Ultra. Unfortunately, getting one in the UK proved challenging. Amazon Germany say they will ship to the UK, but this turned into a bit of a nightmare.

Anyway, while I was stuck in the hellish void that is not owning a robot vacuum cleaner, like some kind of caveman, Ecovacs went and released the T20 Omni. It ticks all my boxes, on paper at-least, and for a change Amazon UK had stock and £300 off. So I thought I would give it a shot. Ecovacs is not a brand I have ever really considered much, partly because removing the pads to clean carpet (no longer an issue with this model) would have been a deal breaker for me. I haven’t been able to find a YouTube video or website review that isn’t basically a paid advert (many say they get sent them for free but the review is ‘their words’. Sure, but no one want to upset the companies that give them stuff to generate content with, anyway…). Even the Amazon listing had no reviews at the time of purchase, so maybe I’m mad, but for what it’s worth, here is my entirely unbiased initial thoughts after a solid day of testing. Hope it helps others considering this robot vacuum cleaner. 

Early impressions mostly good, maybe getting towards very good, but not ‘smashed it out of ballpark’ amazing. Yet anyway. It’s a lot more customisable than Roomba in terms of cleaning settings, so I’m still getting my head around what works best for my house and family, so as I say, these are first impressions and take that as you will. 

For a start, my Roomba J7+ just couldn’t get my golden retrievers hair off my low pile living room rug, at the most it just bunched it up into clumps so I could pick them up myself. No mater how many passes, or what I tried, it just didn’t have the power. Initially I was disappointed with the T20’s performance on the same rug, but after tweaking the settings for deeper clean, more passes and higher suction etc, the rug is now almost as clean as it is after a manual vac with my Dyson. So I’m very pleased about that, if it failed that test it was going back and I would have to go back the the drawing board for sourcing Roborock S8. 

It’s still a bit annoying how long it needs to achieve an acceptable clean of the rug, but as long as I’m not doing it my self I guess I don’t really care, it can do it when I sleep or I’m out at work or hiking. And my large-ish (by UK standards) house is mostly tile and oak wood floors, with a couple of low pile rugs. 

However, what I will say is that this is absolutely not a vac for people with mostly carpet, or even a lot of rugs and pets. If that’s your house, then don’t even entertain the thought of the T20, this isn’t the vacuum you are looking for. The settings required to achieve a just-about-acceptable carpet clean would kill the battery in minutes or take literally forever, if at all. Basically all you need to know is it’s next to useless on carpet, unless you have a very small amount you can hammer it with. 

Vacuuming wood, tile and slate floors seems more then sufficient, but what vac isn’t (unless you have deep crevices, which I don’t so can’t comment). The spinning mop pads work well, I prefer this approach to the pads most just drag around. Seems to actually clean, not just wipe. It also lifts them a good amount on carpet, no issues with wet rugs, which it does a great job of accurately detecting. 

The vac itself has no water tank built in. I’m not yet sure if this is a pro or a con. I can see this approach has a number of possible upsides (less to go wrong, more room for larger vacuum motors and batteries etc, less weight to carry around). The downside it has to keep going back to the dock to wash and wet the mopping pads (user configurable to 5, 10 or 15 minute intervals). The travel time and cleaning time adds considerable length to the cleaning, as it did this about 4 or 5 times. This could be an issue for some people, and may outweigh the benefits, especially if you wanted to mop every day. I plan once a week, so I’ll chose a day when the whole family are out all day and time is not an issue. 

Build quality seems decent, not quite as good as the Roomba in that respect, certainly not what I think it should be for the money, but yeah it’s fine, whatever. The dock is big but not quite as bad as I was expecting. Water tanks etc seem well made and easy to access and fill. Pad cleaning and drying works as advertised, but I will need much longer with it for a better idea. 

For those that haven’t used the Ecovacs app - it pretty meh. Not quite as user friendly as iRobot’s, but it has a lot more settings so it’s fair compromise. Not as good as Roborocks from what I have seen. But it gets the job done. I like the Apple shortcuts support, so I can create some home automation’s like not running and giving a warning when a door sensor detects a door it need access though is closed, more control over schedules, starting when the last person leaves the house etc. 

The battery seems to take forever to charge. But maybe the J7+ was smaller so it seemed quicker. I’m also perhaps being impatient with my new toy. I think it’s adequate though, unless you are planning to do a large house, including mopping and multiple passes. 

It’s probably not really fair to say much more at this point, without some more long term use. Straight out the box it did miss quite a few spots. It also simply refused to go a few places that even the stupid J7+ would, which just basically just blundered about, smashing into stuff and cleaning under my dining room table for example was a complete lottery. All my mid century furniture with its many narrow legs probably doesn’t help, but I was expecting a LiDAR based system to be a bit better at getting through stool legs and such like. It also didn’t get close enough to the walls quite frequently, leaving quite a bit of debris. Maybe the mapping will improve and there are a lot of settings that I think might help with it’s navigation, so I’ll see what changes and tweak can be made before making any definitive assessments. 

So it could be a keeper with a bit of work, but as I say, I need a few days with it. However so far it’s looking promising."

"Need Help SelectingLooking for recommendations in a robotic vacuum that would best suit our needs. 

Home is single story, 1500 square feet. One pet that sheds a lot. Laminate throughout, with a couple rug runners.

"[HELP Needed] Shark Ion RV754 can’t connect to WifiHello everyone,
I am from Brazil and just bought the vacuum Shark Ion and got a problem with it when installing. 
It seems that the robot won’t connect to my wifi no matter what. I am already trying to connect to a 2.4g wifi when the robot wifi light is blinking (after I press both lateral buttons). 
I’ve tried many times rebooting both my phones, my router and my robot and it’s dock. I’ve even changed my wifi password but it still can’t connect. The problem seems to appear after I connect into the shark’s wifi and it never connects to my house’s wifi

Does anyone know what to try? I thought about calling costumer support but it would be hard since it would be an international call
Thanks everyone in advance!"

"Shark Schedule won’t work🤬I got my vacuum this last Christmas. Set it up, set a schedule and it’s been great. I’ve noticed the last few weeks it hasn’t been following the schedule. I have it set to M-F @10am so it goes off while my boyfriend and I are at work. But recently it’ll come on during the weekends at the right time and some days during the week it won’t come on. I noticed which days it didn’t come on during the week and switched those with Sat. and Sun. but it still skipped a different day of the week. Help?

Edit: its not reading the days of the week wrong, when I click history the days/dates match up. No idea what’s the issue"

"Anyone here purchase extra insurance on their vac when purchasing? Like the ones that the vendor offers with purchase? (Asurion, Geeksquad, etc). Any feedback on that? Worth it?I'm about to purchase my first robot vac (a Roborock). Often when I buy things made of a lot of mechanical parts I consider buying insurance. I've never owned a robot vacuum so I don't know how finicking they get after warranty. 

Anyone have any feedback on that? That you'd done it it's been helpful? Do you just rely on credit card free additional warranty?

Just about to buy a Revo on their site, but considering buying it on Amazon so I can get that 3-year of additional warranty. The 3 year Asurion insurance on a $700 robot will probably be around $80. Worth it?"
"Shark AI RV2520A0US Front Wheel Assembly HelpI have two of these. One of them the wheel keeps popping out of the housing because it appears to have been worn out somewhat (so the wheel can just about fall out).  I have scoured the internet on how to replace the wheel assemble in whole and most instructions instruct you to remove the two screws that are in the white plastic area.  One website mentioned the screws are a TR9 Torx.  I went out and bought a kit that included Torx bits so I can remove this and it wouldn't do anything.  I zoomed in with the camera on my phone and I am not even sure this is a screw of any sort.  Almost looks like a rivet.  I did not strip it out in case anyone is wondering.  Both of my vacuums seem to have the same exact scenario.  Has anyone ever removed the wheel housing on this model?  Thanks!

"New to mapping robots need help with schedule not performingHi... I just got an iLife t10s.  The map it drew was awesome and accurate upon first run. 

That's the good part.

I connected it to the Toya smart app first of course (how I see the map)

I ordered and named the rooms.

Then I went to timer (basically the add schedule thing) in settings.  Did so....and it wont run.  I've tried multiple times... setting different times, checking time zone of app location and all that and it doesn't want to start unless I start the ""auto clean"" button.  It works fine doing that but I'd like the automation of it working on days at certain times and such.

Any help would be appreciated.  It's pretty generic..like when you connect to the app you use the Wi-Fi robot vacuum connection.

Thank you for any thoughts here.

"I need help deciding on a new one!Hi!
I am looking forward on buying a new Robot Vacuum, I've had a Ecovacs (basic) and a off-brand one.

I want a better, more reliable, with mopping and mapping, but I don't want it to be like $1500.

So far I've found the ROIDMI EVA, with self cleaning for the dust AND the mop (not bad on paper), but only has 13 reviews for that model.
Anyone has experience with the brand? Or can recommend another one in the same (or lower) price range?

"Looking for a robot vacuum - confused by terminology lolHello, I had an older robot vacuum when they first came out but because it did not clean that well (like corners and such) and would knock into things so i got rid of it. 

Now I know things have been updated but I'm pretty overwhelmed by the abundance of choice and can't tell which ones have the features I want:

&#x200B;

\- I would prefer for something under $1000 but tbh idk what the price range is really idk if I can get something under $500 with the features I want lol

\- I would like for it to have mapping ability and an app that will let me choose and block which areas I don't want it to go into

\- something that can clean carpet

\- selff emptying feature ( I don't mind paying extra for but would still prefer under $1000)

\- a mopping function would be good (but I am okay with sacrificing on that or getting a subpar mopping system on the basis that running it everyday would be of some small help)

\- maybe something that will be able to avoid objects in front of it - but okay with sacrificing on that if it will get too expensive

"I think I effed up - flying with a robotSo, I have a house full of cats and decided to get into the robot game. I lurked in the sub for a while and ordered a Roborock s7 with the unit and everything. 

The problem is, I placed the order in Germany. I live in Turkey. I’ll be going there next week. The Amazon page said the item is 4,5 kilograms but my friend said it’s over 16 kilograms. My plan was to get it for a more reasonable price and then just bring it home. 

My question is, is the box too big to fit in a suitcase?   I’m not sure if I would be allowed to take that with me as a carry on. 

If it helps, the model I ordered is a roborock s7 maxV ultra."
"Shark Robot Error #2 helpHi everyone. My robot all of a sudden quit cleaning due to this error. I checked everything and cleared the usual suspects. Then noticed one wheel was barely turning unless I put force into it. Long story short, I ordered a new replacement wheel and installed that earlier. I turn it back on after charging and get the same error with it still pulling to the right. 

When I flip it upside down, I can push both wheels down and they spring back as normal. They both spin similarly as well both pushed in or out. 

I pulled the brush roller apart a bit more and cleaned even more. I noticed the brush roller kind of 'clicks' as I spin it by hand. I'm wondering if that is normal or if there is some way I can get into the motor more."

"Call for help from robot vacuum reviewersHi! I've been procrastinating getting other people to help with the wiki/sidebar and I feel bad about that. I would love to get this stuff updated, but I mainly read other people's work and don't test myself. Please comment here if you're interested and why you're qualified. Also, feel free to let me know if you have suggestions on layout, etc. I'm personally thinking of a few key sections:

* Youtubers/reviewers that we trust – potentially adding any caveats we've seen from the community along with reaching out to the reviewers to see if they have any comment
* A comprehensive and updated list of robot vacuums with their features and recommended/not
* Useful articles/videos we've seen
* A ""help me chose a robot vacuum"" template and automod (this would include things like ""I want auto empty, but not a mop""

"Help me pick out my first robot vacuum!Hi everyone.

I just discovered this subreddit today. I’m 28M trying to purchase my first robot vacuum. I’m overwhelmed by the number of choices (probably not surprising to anyone here) and would like some advice on the best model for me.

I currently rent one carpeted room in a house. I do not necessarily need the most sophisticated vacuum, as it does not need to mop, vacuum hardwood floors, or clean multiple rooms.

I’m looking for something that can vacuum the same path every day at the same time powered by an Amazon Alexa Echo Dot routine. Most of the options I look at use camera, LiDAR, etc. to map rooms automatically, but that seems like overkill for me. I’d like to create my own path manually and then have it run that exact path daily. 

I would also love for it to self-empty, but that’s not a dealbreaker.

Any suggestions?"
"Could you help us decide which robot to go with?Hello world!

My girlfriend and I decided to buy ourselves a robot vacuum for Christmas as it will hopefully change our lives for the better but I must confess that we do not know that much about it. 

We've read several reviews, checked their pages on Amazon and other websites and for instance, in this subreddit is listed the Roomba S9+ as best of the best, is it an updated list or was it a long time ago? When I looked at the roomba's page, some people seemed unhappy, comparing it to the roborock s5 (I believe?), Is this some kind of robot wars or are there actual reasons to dislike it? I am very much afraid of making a mistake when finally picking one instead of another...

We're not very interested in a robot that mops, even if indeed it is a nice addition of course we won't complain if it does, just regular vacuum is fine and we perhaps also care a bit about the noise it might generate, if it is very noisy and takes a long time to clean we're afraid to piss off our neighbours. I've seen the deebot x1 Omni as well, which mops.

So far I'm struggling to decide between those two but if you guys have recommendations, I'm up for it.

"Yeedi Vac Station issue - ""please clean anti drop sensors""Hello! I have a used Yeedi Vac Station and as soon as I got it set up and let it start mapping the house, it ran into a wall for about 10 seconds (without appearing as though it could tell it hit a wall) then stopped and said ""please clean anti drop sensors"".

I have done some searching and found that on these models (or similar models from other companies) the mop bucket can leak water into these sensors, leading to rust/etc. However, upon close inspection, each sensor looks to be pretty clean. I can't see any dirt or obstructions from the bottom through the lenses. I also tried a factory reset but it didn't help.

Do I need to take it apart to access the sensors from the top? I am comfortable doing that, just not sure how. If anybody has had a similar issue and fixed it, please help me!!"
"How I got my Shark Vacuum to connect to Wi-FiLike many other posters, I spent wayyyy too much time pulling my hair out to get my dang Shark AI Ultra to connect to the Wi-Fi network. I’ve documented my observations that eventually led to a successful connection to hopefully help someone else out there. These instructions are specifically for a mesh WiFi system.

The systems:
Shark AI ultra with self empty base (from Costco, Model UR2000SR)
Internet: Starlink router with Deco 6E Mesh system (set at 2.4 GHz band, not auto). Starlink has its own network, while the mesh system has a different network name.

Initial observations: Shark vacuum was connected for a few months but then stopped doing its daily clean and clean logging, probably due to getting something stuck underneath and I didn’t save it in time and it ran out of batteries.

**Note do not skip any steps. Skipping any step will result in failure to connect and must redo entire process**

1. Delete bot on app (on iPad not iPhone)
2. Sign out of app then sign back in
3. Put bot belly up and hold the clean button to reset. Weird beeping noise, keep belly up/upside down
4. Unplug Starlink router AND wifi mesh system
5. Turn off iPad
6. Plug in Starlink and wifi mesh until internet is back and running
7. Turn on iPad and ensure internet is working/connected on mesh system. Ensure auto connect is on mesh system not Starlink network.
8. Roll bot back on to base and wait for happy bot noises, bot emptying and “Ready to clean” greeting. WiFi light should NOT be on at this point. If it is try resetting bot again.
9. Hold “dock and clean” buttons until “Ready to connect to WiFi” greeting
10. Check that Shark WiFi network pops up in settings but don’t connect to it. Stay on mesh system
11. Connect the new bot. The “bear with me” initial WiFi connection screen should only stay up for a few seconds before moving on to the next step. If it takes more than 30 sec connection probably failed.
12. Select the WiFi mesh system network and insert password and connect. Again, should only take 10 seconds to successfully connect. This step failed and received and “unable to connect to WiFi when I did not reset the iPad.

Map and schedule should be there already

I never got the bot to successfully connect when using my iPhone… so in summary, in order to successfully reconnect to WiFi from scratch you need to reset EVERYTHING, wifi, device and bot.

Hope this helps someone else. I really love this robot vacuum but not the WiFi stuff. I want to get another for my upstairs but the WiFi issues are stopping me. Let’s so how long I have to go before doing a full WiFi reset again. I have these exact instructions on a post it note on my base."

"[Recommendation] Looking for a decent budge Vacuum Robot in [Canada]Allo,

I would need a little bit of help to decide. I have always thought robots vacuum were kind of useless. But I recently got a really cheap iRobot 652. And I must admit, I am kind of fascinated. Yes, it is an old model, tts pathing is identical to a drunk old man. But still, it is doing quite a decent job.

Anyway, after a few weeks, I am down the rabbit hole and I would like to upgrade.

* Live in a 2 bedrooms apartment.
* Hard floor only. My gf has asthma, so no carpet.
* No pets but gf has long a thick black Arabic hairs :D
* We do not have a lot of furniture or ""complexe spots"": no cords or socks on the floor ... etc.

I think I am looking for:

* Decent second-hand brand
* Definitely something with a decent pathing. I am not asking for something extremely efficient. But the robot should be able to find all the rooms easily.
* Mop + Vacuum would be really cool
* Self emptying and/or cleaning would be a plus but not needed.

Here the few models I believe would work:

* Roborock S5 Max (really hard to find in Canada)
* Ecovacs Deebot T8+
* Ecovacs Deebot N8 Pro+
* Shark RV2610WA​

We do not have access to a lot of Brand here in Canada. The most common ones seem to be : iRobot, Shark, Ecovacs Deebot, Eufi, Lefant & Neato. I really liked Roborock on paper, but it is impossible to find. And the post + border from the US add up to the final price. 

What do you guys think ? :D 

Thanks !"

"This or that: Roborock Q5 for the better navigation and mapping, or Roomba J8 for the less-likely-to-tangle-with-hair brush rolls?I bought a Roborock Q5 and it arrived a week ago. I really like it so far, app is super intuitive and the navigation seems flawless. HOWEVER, I have two Ragdoll (long-haired) cats, and I have had to clean the fur that accumulates/tangles on the brush roll basically after every single run/every other run.

Given that cat hair is the reason I got the robot vacuum in the first place, I'm tempted by the idea of getting a Roomba J8 instead. According to the Roomba subreddit certain Costcos have it on sale right now for $550 (when I looked previously, it was $700 which is out of my budget). The dual brush roll system is supposed to be better at avoiding tangled pet hair. HOWEVER, I know I'd be giving up the LIDAR navigation, and I feel like I'd be bummed to lose that. Plus, I see mixed reviews on how well the j7/j8 can ACTUALLY prevent cat hair from building up on the brush rolls, and if I sacrificed navigation and ease of use, only to discover the j8 still involved having to clean the brush roll fairly often, I'd regret it.

Thoughts?"

"Shark RV2502AE AI Honeymoon ReviewI'm a long time robot vacuum owner starting off way, way back with an early model Neato around a decade ago. I always loved the way that vacuum scanned rooms and systematically cleaned, they were way ahead of their time. When it finally went kaput after around 6 years of use, we went though 2 iRobot models and 1 off brand copy with their ridiculous random vacuuming and none lasted very long. I wanted something like my early Neato but with some more modern features and ended up with the Shark RV2502AE AI. I've had it for 2.5 weeks and here's my experience:

1. Setup was super easy...but relatively slow. Not sure if that's an issue with the bot or the app (lot's of poor reviews of the earlier version of the app), but connecting to my Wi-fi took long enough that I thought it failed and was ready to start over before it gave the A-OK. The scanning run (roughly 1000 sq ft) took about 30 minutes and was remarkably accurate. It doesn't bump into anything (cough...iRobot)
2. Run time. Shark claims the unit has 120 of run time. While the app reports roughly 120 minutes to complete a run of my 1000 sq feet, the reality is it's closer to 180 minute due to 2 stops to charge. So I think it's really run time is likely less than 100 minutes, but hard to say exactly as the programming is clever here as it appears to estimate how long it needs to work and seems to take more frequent shorter charges than draining the battery very low and then charging for a long time, today it took it's first charging break at 60% when it was also taking a break to empty the bin (more below). When it finished it was still at 30%. And after it takes a charging break, it returns exactly to where it left off to finish a run. 
3. Cleaning is great...and quiet! As mentioned above, it takes roughly 2 hours of runtime to clean my space and as I work from home noise was a concern. It's the quietest unit I've owned. It has 3 levels of power (eco, normal, and high), but I've only run it on normal. Inspection after the fact it sucked up all dust and pet hair I could see. The only places it misses are in my kitchen where my counters have a recess too small for it to fit under. The sweepers get about 1/3 underneath, but I have to hit these with a dust buster or broom if there's any visible debris. It is noisy when it auto empties the bin, but this takes maybe 5 seconds. I have mine programmed to empty every 30 minutes of runtime, but I think that maybe overkill. We have a dog and 2 kids, so maybe our house is a little messier than some, but the advertised 60 day capacity of the dust bin feels exaggerated as I've emptied it once a week so far and it's pretty full but maybe it can really pack dirt in tight. I'll try to leave it a bit longer and see how long before it notifies me to empty.
4. No-Go Zones. Within the app, you can set up block off spots you don't want the robot to clean. Why would one do that? Well...my robot got suck under my bed on a run. One side of the bed is just high enough for it to get under, but not the other.  First 2 runs it did fine but the third it got stuck trying to get out the low side and then confused by pillars under the bed. The good new is it called for help and put itself into hibernation. Again, great programming here. I've now marked that area off and it ignores it. 

So...is it worth the $450 I paid? Well...my Neato cost me around $250 in 2013 and current models run between $200 and $500. The last iRobot we bought was $450 back in 2020 and despite claiming to have ""smart mapping"" just ran around aimlessly, crashed into everything, and lasted less than 2 years. So far, the experience is far closer to my beloved Neato but with a super large bin due to the auto empty functionality. So while a bit of a splurge, certainly a much better experience than the iRobot I previous had. If it lasts, well worth it for me."
"Roomba J7 vs Roborock S6For years my roomba 960 was my faithful robo vacuum but I decided to sell it and get the semi latest in robot vacuum technology.

I was already looking at the J7 with mapping technology like the i7 but now came with a front facing camera. 

But then I saw someone recommend the S6 maxV that has two front facing camera (for depth perception) and a laser mapping system on top. This wowed me especially since Roomba has nothing like that yet.

Anyways I need help decided if the J7 (without the self cleaning base) is in anyway better to roborock s6 in term of cleaning, build quality, software; if not should I go get the S6 maxV?"

What should I be lookin’ out for when snatchin’ up a used robot cleaner? Any specific features or specs I need to be keepin’ an eye on? And how do I know if the joint is legit and in good condition?

Here are a few questions I got brewin’, but feel free to drop any other tips or hacks:

	1.	What’s a fair price range for a second-hand robot cleaner like the Roborock? Should I be worried if the price seems too good to be true?
	2.	How crucial is it to know the age and usage history of the robot cleaner? Any common issues or maintenance drama I should watch out for with older models?
	3.	Are there any tests or checks I should be throwin’ down before sealin’ the deal? What signs of wear and tear or possible problems should I be scopin’ out?
	4.	Is it worth snaggin’ any kind of warranty or guarantee from the seller, considerin’ this is a second-hand buy? And how can I make sure I’m covered and not left hangin’?

I’m countin’ on y’all to drop some real knowledge bombs, share your own experiences, or dish out some solid recommendations. Help a homie out so I can make a smart move and score a reliable robot cleaner that won’t break the bank.

"Samsung Jet Bot+ won't return to the cleaning station. How to fix this?I have Samsung Jet Bot+ vacuum cleaner with this cleaning docking station. But the robot can't make it to the station. When it finishes cleaning and goes back, it tries to dock to the station with its front side, although it should be docked with its back side. The robot behaves as if it doesn't even know it should go backwards there.

So, my Jet Bot+ just goes on and on trying to dock to the station the wrong way. And if I pick it up and place near the station with its back side, it will go backwards and dock successfully. But I think, the bot should be able to do it without my help.

I tried placing the docking station in other places, where it is even more free space around the station, but the outcome is the same. How can I fix this? Or is it just buggy model? Or is it something with the docking station?

Thanks for any help in advance!"

"Shark robot vac playing ominous music and stops working?Me and my roommates cannot figure out what the hell is wrong with this thing. We’ve tried everything. It’s charged. It’s not stuck on anything. The dirt bin isn’t full. We’ve taken apart and cleaned it as much as we possibly can and it only runs for a few minutes or so, then stops working and plays this tune and refuses to keep going. Then I just have to pick it up myself and place it back on its dock. We’ve only had it for a little over a year, but we do have a lot of cats and used to run it twice a day to keep our floors clear of litter… is it just cramping out from the wear and tear? 😕 any insight would be helpful bc we’re completely stumped.

"Help a noob pick a vacuumThinking about getting a robot vacuum, but got confused by all the different brands and the huge price difference.

"Decision paralysis Ecovacs/Dreame/iRobotI’m looking to buy a top of the line robot vacuum in the near future, but I have complete decision paralysis owing to the fact that I have a “complex” space to clean. 

My house is multi-level (white tiles downstairs, carpet upstairs), and a smallish but very well-filled space (some would say cluttered!). I have two long haired cats who shed a lot. 

I’m considering getting two bots as mopping is my downstairs priority, and carpet vacuuming my upstairs priority, and I’m not sure there is a bot which excels at both. Upstairs is particularly cluttered so navigation is important too— I don’t want to be constantly dealing with a stuck bot!

Front runners for downstairs (or possibly whole house if they’re good enough) are Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni and Dreame L10S Pro. Considering a top line Roomba for upstairs if carpet cleaning isn’t up to scratch with one of the former … but concerned about it getting stuck?

"Analysis paralysis, any help is appreciated for new vacuumI want a self-emptying vacuum for $300-400

I live in a one floor apartment approximately 1000ft with 80% being hardwood. I want something I basically don’t need to pay attention to more than once every 2 weeks and has high longevity and low operating cost. Single guy no pets.

I was initially drawn to shark’s line for the lack of bag use. I like not needing consumables. But after reviewing the price of generic bags on Amazon I’m not so concerned anymore and have seen negative feedback on shark products here on Reddit. 

I just want something that will last a long time and be serviceable into the future if anything breaks. I don’t want to buy a weird brand and have to stockpile bags and parts. I don’t care about alexa/Google functionality but a solid app interface that lets me schedule and set no-go zones and do piece-wise cleaning (couple rooms at a time) would be great. 

So far I’m thinking roomba i3+ is in my budget ($350 Black Friday price) and will have strong product support into the future. Is there something else I should consider? Better bang for my Buck?"

"Help! Problem with Samsung Jet AI +While browsing OfferUp I found a Samsung Jet AI+, with a problem, going very cheap. 

The machine appears nearly new.  It connects up fine and works perfectly for five minutes.  It then will stop and give the error message:

“Something went wrong
There's a problem with the object recognition sensor. Turn the power off and then on again. If the error persists, contact Customer Service.”

If restarted it will last another minute then give the error “There's a problem with the Al system.”

It will restart and give the same error message in a minute or two. 

The robot is clean, the sensor windows are clean. I’m thinking a problem with the motherboard or software. I can’t find anyway to reset or reinstall the software on the robot. I suspect it’s a motherboard problem. There are none available as far as I can determine.  Any suggestions for a fix?  Anyone had anything similar happen?

I suspect my best course is to wait until a broken unit is available and swap the motherboard, but any suggestions would be appreciated."

"Buying my very first robot vacuum and I need some help!Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some real help from some real people. 

TL;DR (I’m putting this here for those who don’t want to read the entire long post): I’m trying to choose a robot vacuum from Amazon, it must be able to pick up human hair and dog fur from tile floors. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so I have never owned a robot vacuum before but I have wanted one for a long, long time. Now that Amazon is having a sale and I have about $300 in amazon credit, this seems like the best time to get one. Only problem is there are so many options and I have been sitting here reading reviews for hours and I can’t decide because of course the reviews are all conflicting and confusing. I think I’ve narrowed it down to two but I am open to any other suggestions if there’s something you think is better (I do have some wiggle room on the price, as I’d like one that will work and also last). So here’s what I’m looking at now:

1. Roomba i4 + EVO ($400 with prime deal & comes with a free 3rd gen echo dot / listed price $667.98)
2. Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL ($400 / list price $600)

I live in a 2 bdrm/2bath apartment, approximately 1000sq ft. I’m a single parent with a teenager and a fluffy little yorkie mix. We all shed. Between the 3 of us, we shed a lot! There is always hair and fur everywhere. I hate vacuuming and you know the teen won’t do it so I think it would be nice to have one of these around to help me out a bit. We are quite messy, which is also part of why I put off buying one of these for so long but I’m hoping that having this will motivate us to pick up our shoes/clothes/etc off the floor. I’m tired of living in an apartment full of clutter and hair/fur. Would be great to be able to walk around barefoot in my house. I have a bona for washing the floors but it doesn’t work as well when there’s hair everywhere! Oh almost forgot to add, our apartment is all tile, no carpet or rugs.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is that it can handle picking up all the hair and fur without clogging up or anything. Ill be honest, I am not at all familiar with the Shark brand. I’ve wanted a Roomba forever but I think it’s just because it’s the one I’ve heard the most about. But I’m not going to make a choice based on name recognition alone. For all I know, the Shark is just as good or even better than the Roomba. One thing that makes me lean more towards the Shark is that it’s bagless and the Roomba bags are costly. On Amazon, I found a package of 3 replacement bags for $20 and another package with all the other replacement parts for $55. I could not find the Shark replacement filters on Amazon or even by googling it so idk the cost of those; all I found were off brand replacement parts that claim to fit but have mixed reviews on whether they actually do. Also, I’m not sure if it’s safe to use off brand replacement parts. But im clueless about this so if people who know more about it tell me it’s fine then I’m fine with it. I just worry if something goes wrong with a bad part then it will break the vacuum. Regardless, I won’t need to buy bags for the Shark so I assume it will cost less as far as replacements go. Other than that, both of these seem pretty good.

Of course, both have pros and cons. Also, both have an average of 4.3 stars on Amazon. I really just can’t read any more reviews or my head will explode. I don’t know if I can trust random websites who get a percent of every sale; I feel like this just incentives them to try to sell you on a more expensive product rather than what’s really best for you. And I honesty can’t tell what is going on with amazon reviews. I saw several reviews that made no sense. Someone actually wrote “I love it, but it leaves behind clumps of hair” (and many others are very similar to this, with 5 stars but a lot of negative stuff in the actual review). I don’t understand it… why do you love it if it isn’t doing its job? What do you love about it? Are you even a real person? Did someone pay you to put 5 stars but they don’t care what you actually write in the body of the review? I feel like either I’m going crazy or the world is or possibly both. 

So yeah, I need help. I hope there are people here who can help me. I really appreciate any and all information, suggestions, etc. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. You are true heroes!"
"Shark vacuum bought in 2020The vacuum is not working. It often gets stuck going on circles. 

I called the tech help line and did all the troubleshooting with them. They basically said that my robot’s software was out of date and there wasn’t anything they could do. I was then told I could buy a new one with the deal they had on their website..

Is there really no way that the software can be updated? Has anybody experienced this?"
"A little help would be appreciated, Samsung sr20m7070wsI have a Samsung robovac that has been setup in the main living area (down stairs) I moved it to the upstairs area where the bedrooms are and it's not cleaning the entire area.  The space is an open office with a bedroom off the north and south walls. The charging station is setup in the middle of the office along the east wall (closer side to the doors to the bedroom). It will clean the office fine then will go into the north bedroom to the but only go a short distance into the room ( doesn't even reach the bed) before turning around and going out. It avoids the bedroom to the south entirely. At first I thought it was running out of battery but I have checked it as it returns and it still has over half. It has also on multiple occasions reversed into the wall near the charger and kept reversing until it's stuck on the skirting board then sends a stuck error when all it needs to do is go forwards. 

I have tried resetting it although the reset may have not worked properly because when I reconnected it, it remembered the schedule I had set. 

I have also tried doing a manual clean where I get it to go around the perimeter of the entire upstairs but that also did not help. 

Thanks for your advice."

"Help - Dreame L10 Pro ""talks"" to itself 

Hello,

 I have a problem with my Dreame L10 Pro that is already becoming ""scary"". During the night, around 3:00/4:00 in the morning, almost every day for the past week, the vacuum cleaner ""speaks"" to itself with the Chinese voice of when the vacuum cleaner is turned on for the first time. Of course, during the night it\`s scary . I've already done a reset, losing everything, maps. I've already restarted the router, but it's still the same :/ . Does anyone have an idea what it could be?"
"Someone here to help wtih my decision?Hi it’s my first time buying a robot vacuum and I’ve been really doing a lot thinking to choose the right one for me.
First of all I live in a 3 bedroom apartment of around 60 square meter (or 650 square feet I guess) with a friend of mine and we both each have our own cat (one is a ragdoll🥲), we have a middle sized carpet in the living room and everywhere else is wood floor.
And we don’t have that many furniture but we have some pet stuff on the floor quite everywhere. Also I’m kinda tired with vacuuming all the kitty litter and fur lying all over the floor while I have to study for a long time during the weekdays.
In this situation I narrowed the candidates down to four ones and I hope anyone could pick the right one for me or maybe rank them. Thanks in advance🙂

1) Shark AI ultra self-empty (Av2511 something model)
This one is currently $300 on Amazon 
And it has all the cutting-edge(?) functions like Lidar mapping, auto emptying, and I heard its basic functions are as nice as others
Alhough I see bad reviews of Shark brand and its apps quite often, I think this one has everything that I need and has the best price.
Finally I also like that it doesnt have a dust bag

2) Dreame Z10 Pro
It has all the functions the first one has and even better, I saw that its obstacle avoiding ability is quite good. But quite more expensive ($480?) and considering customs and shipping costs🤯 since I live outside the US… And although I really like that it has mopping function but I don’t think I’m gonna use it that much… finally I saw some reviews that its basic picking up function could have been better.

3) irobot J7+
Many reviewers compliment this product and I saw that it has very nice obstacle avoiding technology. And I heard irobot’s two brushes thing is quite good at carpet cleaning and hair tangling. It is good in overall and cheaper than other high-end robot vacuums. Yet it’s way over my budget.

4) Eufy L70
It had that Lidar thing and basic functions also seemed to be nice enough. Its only drawback is missing autocleaning function I guess.. Though it also has mop function(which again I don’t really know how often I will use..) and I think cheapest of all these four

So which one of these four do you guys recommend? I’m about to buy Shark one but I would like to consider many things before buying. Thanks for reading a long post!"

"Combo Mop/Vacuum - Robot Vacuum or Stand Up VacuumHi,

After many youtube videos, I've drilled down to:

Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum with Empty Wash Fill Dock - a little pricey, in my opinion, but if it's the best, I'll get it

Roomba Combo j7+ Robot Vacuum and Mop - I know the mop isn't as strong as the other options, but it's a good value option.

"Help re buying new robot vacuumWe had an ecovacs deebot ozmo 950 for last 2.5 yrs which worked relatively well apart from some annoying map mechanics/resetting merging etc.. then all of a sudden one day stopped working - wouldnt leave the dock, saying charging but stuck on 1% despite multiple resets etc..
Luckily we had extended warranty so sent off to get assessed- just heard that we are getting store credit instead (so I am assuming it was not reparable)...

My options are to stick with ecovacs eg OMNI or go with a different brand which I have no experience with. I am a bit hesitant with sticking with ecovacs due to our experience and reading reviews..

"Shag Carpets and robot vacuumsI have seen this question all over the Internet (bc I have a shag rug/carpet)


I have done some testing on this and want this info out there for anyone that it can possibly help.


Eufy 35C - this was my first robot vacuum. It has no mapping and just randomly bounces off walls but it didn't have any problem with the shag carpet. Additionally since it was under 3 inches in height, it was able to get under my couch


360 robot S5 - this thing is a beast. It's lasted me several years now with no issues. The mapping, suction, and reliability is great. It also handles the shag carpet with no problem. Only downside is that it doesn't auto empty but I don't care since it's the only vacuum I know of that can handle shag and has mapping. 


Deebot n8+ - this thing sucks, and not In a good way. Has trouble getting to its base. Decent suction. The mopping function is useless. It can't get onto the shag by itself. It's pattern of cleaning seems insane. Not efficient.


Roborock q5 - good mapping and pattern of cleaning. Suction wasn't great. Can't get onto shag. 


Tldr: if you have a shag carpet, get a eufy 35c (if you don't care about mapping) or a 360 robot s5 (if you want great mapping and better suction)"
"Roborock S6 Pure vs S6 MaxV?Hey Reddit,

I've been thinking of getting a robot vacuum, but the amount of options is overwhelming. After finally settling on Roborock, I now need to choose a modell. The S6 Pure and S6 MaxV seem to be good options.

It would need to clean about 100 square meters of space, deal with my long hair and be pet friendly, since I have two dogs. Because of the later fact, I'm leaning closer towards the MaxV, because of the object avoidence feature, but is a lot more expensive (And, quite honestly, more than I want to spend on a vacuum, that still requires manuell help).

Mopping isn't a priority at all. I've heard it's not the best feature in those vacuums anyway.


Do you have any experience with either vacuums especially in relation to pets?

Edit: Bought the cheaper S6 Pure an couldn't be happier. This thing is amazing! The vacuum cleaner and dog get along as well :)"

"Help deciding on new Vacuum i7+, j7+ or T10+Looking at replacing yet another i7+ thru warranty, i think this is the 4th replacement.  They all tend to just stop charging and/or lose connection to the app completely after about a year.

Currently looking at either another i7+, the newer j7+ or the ecovacs t10+

The ecovacs having the mop attachment is a plus, as we have a large area that is mostly/only tile.  However, i have heard their app/software is pretty crappy.

The j7+ looks to have lower reviews on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) and others, but seems to be the replacement of the i7+ as far as i can tell.

The i7+ still shows to be the highest rated for our use case on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) but having to pay the warranty cost every year to year and a half is getting really old.

Needs/wants - easy app usage, ability to get at least sort of close to corners, self emptying, mop attachment is a plus

"Seeking maintainable vac...My sister and I have been using a Neato D6 for a while now.  Recently we made the mistake of leaving it off its charger for too long (stuck under a table), and now it won't charge at all.  Even tried changing batteries, doesn't work.  One person with the same problem said putting the battery in another neato and switching it back helped them, but we don't have another one.

I feel like somewhere in there is a very stupid and solvable problem that under other circumstances would be simple to troubleshoot and fix.

"Best for vacuum only for medium pile carpet and multiple floors? Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, or Neato D9?Please help me pick my first robot vacuum. 

Multiple floors 1200sqft total, 1 cat, 1 human. I can speedrun vacuum my house in about 25-35 minutes, but that doesn't include stairs or multiple passes -- real ""deep"" vacuum cleaning time about 1.5 hours.  I'm looking for a way to reduce the amount of time down from 2-3 hours per week, while living in a cleaner house. 

First floor has hard floors with one area rug, second floor has mostly medium pile (.5in) carpet for bedrooms, but it's uniform cut (not berber style). 

 I have 1 senior cat that sheds some, but not excessively, but by the end of the week I can collect a decent amount of hair.  I'm looking mainly to pick up things like: crumbs in the kitchen, cat hair, litter, and general lint and dust.  No shoes upstairs, so I'm not worried about ground-in dirt in carpet. I'm also not too worried about pet mess, since I don't plan to run the vacuum when not home. It's more for after-work while I make dinner or fold laundry, or mornings when I go on a coffee run. 

Currently trying to decide between the Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, and Neato D9. Auto empty would be nice, but supporting multiple levels is a must.  Budget is about $500. I don't really need mopping, would rather have the best vacuum.

Roborock Q5+ pros: Lidar, good mapping, good app.  
Roomba j7+ pros: carpet performance, better build and support?  
Neato D9 pros: Lidar, better shape? edge cleaning? lower price.

Currently leaning towards the Roborock Q5. Any suggestions? Am I missing anything? Thanks!"
I just bought a new battery for my Neato d85 and it says the same thing about i need to push the switch inside it's dustbin to ON.And yes i have been under the support menu and clicked on NEW BATTERY.Any help?
"Narwal robot mop - I need help with the cliff sensor!Hello! This is my first time on this subreddit. I am coming to you with an annoying problem I have with my Narwal robot mop. The mop works great, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to make the cliff sensor more sensitive.

You see, I'm using this on a wrestling mat and it keep running off the edge. Certain edges of the mat seem to register the cliff sensor, but others don't.

Does anyone know of a way to ""trick"" the robot into thinking there's more of a cliff? I'll include a picture so you can see what I'm referring to.

https://imgur.com/a/P89fGo1
We have tried mapping the robot and putting up barriers to create a fake wall that the robot sees on it's map, but it still runs off the edge. I was thinking there might be some sort of tape or paint we could apply which would absorb the IR light from the cliff sensor, thus making it think there's more of a sheer drop?

Any help is appreciated! I know this is a strange dilemma. Thanks for reading!

Edit: We've also tried using no-go zones, but the robot will drive into the no-go zone and then shut down since it's in a no-go zone. That's a totally different problem!"

"Just bought a SharkIon R76 RV761 s any tips to help it?Hi all,

I decided to try out a semi-cheap robot vacuum and noticed my local hardware store had this in stock. I did some research and I do know it doesn't have any mapping abilities or boundary lines. It just kinda  bounces around until it deems the room ""done"". 

I live in a 1000sqft apartment 2brd 1 bth, open concept style of living room + kitchen. I'm curious to know if I want to vacuum the bedrooms if I should just manually place him and let him go to work, or if just letting bounce around randomly on the chance he'll make down the hallway. 

&#x200B;

Or if anyone knows of a better model let me know.  He isn't really replacing my vacuuming/mopping routine, but I'm hoping he'll keep the apartment cleaner so when I do my weekly cleaning it's less dirty overall."
shark rv2502ae wifi helpI am not having luck with getting my Robot setup on wifi/though the Shark app. Everything was setup and working well untill the robot got stuck one day and didn't return home.  Since then it has been disconnected from wifi in the app. It continued to work if I pushed the clean button but not through the app. I called technician support and they had be deleted the profile/map and try to start again but it fails to setup because it can't connect to my 2.3 wifi. Password is correct and I've rebooted router/shark/phone. Technical support said they would have their advanced team call me but haven't yet. Does anyone know of anything that I can try short of retuning this for an exchange?
If you ever had an issue with the vacuum mop not dispensing enough water. I have investigated simple fix and have some additional suggestions it probably could be applied to many robot vacuum models. This was an issue on my Roidmi Eve Plus and might help you out too.
"Looking for a new robot vacuum and not sure where to startI have a two-story house and a Neato Botvac Connected (being used upstairs) and a Neato Botvac D7 (being used downstairs).  The D7 is starting to have a lot of ""Reboot Me"" errors, and I have to take it apart repeatedly to keep it working.  I would like to replace the downstairs vacuum now and possible add another upstairs vacuum later.

Preferences:  I am able to schedule which rooms I want vacuumed downstairs and when.  Currently I have the vacuum run most days at 1 AM and 6 AM for most of the downstairs and then once a week at 5 PM to clean our bedroom.  I would like to keep that kind of functionality/flexibility.  I also appreciate being able to have no go zones for places under furniture where vacuums tend to get stuck.

Self-emptying is nice, but not a must have.  I just want a vacuum that cleans well and will last, with a useable app.

I have 2 dogs, who don't shed much, but do track in a ton of dirt and dead grass.

My understanding is that the newer Neato vacs aren't great, and the newest app doesn't support more than one vacuum at a time.

Thank you in advance for any guidance."

"Imported Vacuums from China - Are the apps geolocked?Hi guys I've imported a few Xiaomi 1 and 1S robot vacuum cleaners directly from China for use overseas before (as its much cheaper than the local price) but a couple years ago electronics have been locked for use outside of China i.e. the apps won't work unless you are in China or have a Chinese phone number.

I'm looking to help a friend upgrade to a Xiaomi 2 Pro robot, so I just wanted to check if anyone has tried importing a recent Xiaomi robot vacuum recently and been able to use the app overseas? I have talked with customer service for a couple of brands and they have told me the app is not usable outside of China, but I know for certain that Xiaomi in the past hasn't been an issue."
"Searching for a Robot Vacuum/Mop (with auto clean dock) for around 300/420 Euro's.So for the  past week I've been searching for a Robot vacuum cleaner (with mop) and an auto clean dock for around 3 to 400 Euro's.. And it actually sucks making a proper choice. On [amazon.de](https://amazon.de) I found the following with quite a few nice vouchers:

\- Dreame D10 Pro  
\- Botslab S8 Plus  
\- Ultenic T10  
\- neabot Q11  
\- obode A8

I was hoping someone could help me out making a choice. I know the mopping wouldn't be 100% great, but it would be a nice addition to have for basic mopping. And the ability to have multi-floors within the app (so I can vacuum upstairs as well) is a must.  A front-camera would be a nice addition to avoid obstacles that would be in it's way, including the ability to go up obstacles which is about 2cm . We mostly have hard floors.

If there's anyone who could make suggestions to the above models and or other ones I don't know about, please let me know :D. Trying to narrow down my choice."

"S9+ can't dock itself.I've had my S9+ for about 2.5 months. For the last few weeks it has been unable to get itself all the way up the little ramp to dock itself. It just sits there spinning it's wheels (there's little rubber bits rubbing off, too) until I come and give it a little nudge.

"Need a robot Vac recommendations!I have a fairly unique situation, and I’m hoping someone here could help me! I’m trying to find a good robot vacuum, preferably under $300, with stupidly specific requirements:

1. The area it will be cleaning has no wifi, so a robot that can function without any cloud connection is needed.

2. The area is about 90% high pile carpet, so one that can handle this. For reference, my Wyze robot vac gets stuck when moving forward and could only go backwards, the front wheel was too short. I bought a Shark RV2002 from Walmart and that one is able to move forward but it kinda makes a snake path instead of straight rows. This problem probably isn’t fixable..

3. The area I need cleaned is fairly large, about 60x30 feet all open area. I would need a vacuum that could either cover that much area on one charge or is able to return to base then finish vacuuming. I called Shark and they said the RV2002 (and maybe all of their vacuums?) can only continue vacuuming if they’re connected to wifi, otherwise they just give up after returning home.

I’m like 90% sure this isn’t a solvable issue, but hopefully I’m wrong. Thanks in advance for anyone willing to help!"
"Best Mid-Range option?Hi all,

2. Is it worth getting a self empty station?


3. What is the best mid-range?

"Mum bought a Robovac, or a Eufy, or a Demora?Visiting my mum and she just bought herself a robot vacuum. However, it is impossible to install. The website she bought it from calls the model a Robovac R3, the vacuum itself states that it is a BR151 (and after some googling I figured out it looks exactly the same as a Demora BR151).

I wouldn't care about the whole different country, different model, if it wasn't for the fact that it is impossible to find an online manual (and my mum's reaction to new technology is to panic, so she doesn't know where the paper one is).

When I try to find a Robovac app it recommends Eufy app. However, that does not list the vacuum o have in front of me.

Tuya does nothing. And as I'm not even sure how to get the vacuum cleaner on the WiFi without app I'm at a loss.

"Is there a self-cleaning mop from a company with great customer service?I know of Roborock, but after doing research, it just doesn't feel smart to drop $1000 on something where the company is known for refusing to help people who have an issue later.

"Help choosing what to buyHello I am looking to buy a robot vacuum and / combined mop

Our situation is as follows:

Single story flat house 

Floor boards, carpet and tiles

No pets

Have young children so having it be able to detect and avoid objects will be useful

We have Android phones (If this affects the product based on apps)

Our place also needs mopping  
If it could also mop or a separate robot mop could pair with it that would be ideal 

In Australia (may affect product availability)

Having a station so it empties into bags would be useful to avoid needing to empty it every day but is not a deal breaker (bags may be hard to get / create an ongoing cost)

Could you please recommend what to get?



From what i have looked into:
Roomba j7+  looks great for vacuuming and the stand means less mucking around emptying it every time but this does not cover mopping. Maybe this could pair with a mop?

Deebot OZMO 950 I'm seeing mixed reviews

Another option could be a roborock?"
"Help Pick A Robot MopPlease help me find the best robot for our situation. It well be cleaning about 1700 sq ft split 50/50 between vinyl plank and uneven tile with no carpet or rugs in the way. 

Mopping will be its primary job and it will deal with some sticky stuff but not wet spills. It will be cleaning up after 3 adults and 2 young kids, 4 of which have long hair, plus 6 small dogs with some, but not excessive, shedding (pomeranians and peek a poms).

I want one with intelligent navigation and that requires limited to no manual intervention on a regular basis. To this end, self-cleaning mops are ideal. A self-emptying dust bin would be great but is probably overkill. Avoiding cords and shoelaces is another nice to have. Extra bonus points if it can handle a ramp 6"" high and no more than 2' long which would give it access to an additional 500 sq ft to clean.

I currently have an original Roborock Mi whose navigation and suction abilities are good enough, but it can't mop; and a Roborock Xiaowa (?) that sort of mops but requires too much manual intervention both due to weaker navigation and lazy mop design. I have to manually wash and wet the pad about 5 times per mop cycle and it's only mopping about 1100 sq ft. I also have to spot clean several parts of the kitchen each run, sometimes more than once. Id like to avoid that level of involvement.

I'm currently leaning toward the Dream W10, but there are other intriguing options out there like the s7+, S7 MaxV Ultra, N9+, X1 Omni, Mijia Pro, and Roidme Eva. While I've owned several robot vacuums, I've never spent more than about $300 on one before so I want to make sure I do my research before dropping 3-4 times that!"

"Roborock q5 vs irobot i1/i4+I was hoping to find a good robot vacuum for my studio apartment. Most reviews and comments are for large houses. I'm trying to find a simple vacuum that makes my life convenient. I also have long hair and shed a lot which makes life so annoying.

Therefore good performance on carpet and ability to work good with hair is very important. Self emptying is also important but mopping is only good to have. Don't need fancy app features as long as I can use an app to set it to clean when I am not home but even that is super optional

Like to keep the cost minimum 💯 but ok to spend a little for no having to worry about maintenance. Also not having to buy special/expensive bags would be good.

"Fyi about the new xiaomi x10+ ant self-filling stationHey, want to leave this for other people struggling with the robot not getting water from the station.


Out of the box, everything worked except the water from the tank was not reaching neither robot, nor the self cleaning area. Tried a probably stupid approach of filling the tubing by just pumping water with a syringe trough the inlet hole - I don't think that helped, water ended up somewhere were I don't think I should. However, after a couple of power on/off cycles for the station itself (button on the back of it) and couple (like 8-10 in total) of cycles of starting the mop Cleaning function from the app.  LO and behold water started flowing!

* Mapping not that great
* Gets Stuck
* Hairballs can get tangled on the brush

* Not that good on carpet compare to roomba
* Great mapping
* Doesn't get stuck

"X10+ no water after 2 roomsHi there.

I recently bought a Xiaomi X10+. First problem was the robot didn´t get water from the station. This I could solve thanks to the internet. Now the water flows.

Now I got another problem. To make it more visible a map of the flat is atteched. The robot cleans in the order:

1. Badezimmer, tiles, high water flow
2. Waschküche, tiles, high water flow
3. Schlafzimmer, carpet, vacuum only
4. Flur, wood, high water flow
5. Küche, high water flow

The problem starts at step 4. Here the robot doesn´t put water to the mops. The mops are working but running dry. The same at step 5. But before step 4 the robot returns to the base to clean and refill (according to the app) at least once. The rooms at 1 and 2 are summed up less than 20 m².

Is there any thing I or the support can do about this? Or should I return it and get another robot? (I have a Dreame L10s on another floor that works flawless.

No idea what's really important with these devices, so I thought I'd just list some bullet points.

* Trying to spend less than 500 bucks, lower is better.
* 2 people with long hair, no pets.
* no carpets, only hardwood or tile (kitchen).
* A bunch of furniture, some are movable like coffee table.
* Don't mind emptying the robot every few days (>2)
* Wanna be able to schedule cleaning times.
* No small objects on the floor.
* Mop feature is nice to have but not needed.

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"

"How does Samsung Samsung VR10F71 NaviBot (SR10F71UB) hold up against new models these days?Hi all,

a friend gave me his Samsung NaviBot since he does not use it anymore and after an initial test I was hooked. Little stuff left here and there but overall it was a pretty decent experience especially following that small adorable fellow with its cute little arms around while it was doing its job.

Now the actual question: How does it hold up against the modern versions of vacuum robots? Is it considered fully outdated and performing worse than even the entry level robots nowadays or is it a viable option considering it was not a cheap model back then?

I am pretty new to this area of technology and I would have guessed that a huge leap in performance happened since 2013 when the Navibot was initially released but I could not find any reliable information on this. Maybe you guys can help me in finding an answer to this question?

I appreciate any help. "
"Robot Vacuums: Roborock S6 Pure VS Dreame L10 Pro VS Dreame D9 Max VS 360 S9. Can you help me? Thanks!Hi all!

In the title there are the best Robot Vacuums I can get where I live, which one do you think it's the best one? Also, it's true that the L10 Pro has a non-washable HEPA filter?

Final question: do you think the Roborock Q7 Max (non ""+"") it's even better? This is a separate question because for this one I have to wait a sale and I'm not sure I can get it

Thanks!"
"Help recommend me: I need the best robot vacuum in the world, Money is not an object.EDIT:  I wanted to update my post in case anyone like me is googling this years from now.  I ended up buying the Dreame Z10 Pro based on recommendations in this thread, and I couldn't be happier with it.  I've had it for about 3 weeks.  In that time it has only required human intervention ONCE, and it was because it got into a fight with my swiffer and somehow flipped itself over (LOL).  It cleans excellently, the obstacle avoidance really works, it dodges socks, cords, piles of clothes, and all the other obstacles that the other vacuums I tried would get stuck on.  Edge cleaning could be better, it only has one side brush instead of two like the Ecobot that I tried, but its worth the tradeoff.  Mopping also sucks and is way worse than the ecovacs, but like I said in my post, I really don't care about the mopping since my house is almost all carpet.  I highly recommend the Dreame Z10, it was just over $500 after taxes on amazon, and I have a tried several vacuums, and this is the only true ""set and forget"" one.

-- Original post below.

I had a Xiaomi Mijia robotic vacuum (precursor to the roborock) and it SUCKED, kept throwing the ""main brush blocked"" error every time it touched even medium-low pile carpet.  After getting sick of dealing with it, I threw it out and and bought an Ecovacs Deebot N8 with auto-cleaning base and obstacle avoidance.

I've had the ecovacs for about a week now, and I've decided I'm going to return it, because, while it's way better than the Xiaomi one and does a great job cleaning, it still gets stuck all the damn time, and I can't ""set and forget it"" while I'm at work, which defeats the entire purpose of having it.

The vacuum I think I want is the roborock T7 Pro, but that seems to be only available in china, and it only works with the Mi Home app, which I had to use for the Xiaomi and it was an awful awful app.  The T7 Pro is apparently the same as the roborock S7, but it has the camera based AI obstacle avoidance that the american model doesn't have.  I'm not getting a vacuum without obstacle avoidance so that's out.

The Roomba s9+ appears to be the best cleaning robot, but it's 3+ years old now, and also is missing obstacle avoidance, which even budget-priced vacuums have today.

I can't seem to find one that checks my boxes.  The one I see recommended the most on here is the Ecovacs deebot N8, but I tried that and it sucked.

I need a vacuum I can ""Set and forget"", that won't yell at me that it's stuck every single time I have it try to clean while I'm out of the house.  I don't care about the cost, I'll spend 10 grand on one of these fuckers if it can actually friggin' work without needing to be babysat.  Any recommendations?

edit: I don't care about mopping, it's a ""nice to have"", but my home is mainly carpet.

&#x200B;

edit2: Must have an auto-empty base included, or available as a compatible separate purchase."
"Need Help Finding the Right Vacuum**Previously Used Vacuums & Issues**

Roomba I7+

* Rams into walls and furniture.
* No mopping capabilities.
* Didn't work properly in darkness.

Roomba J7+

* Rams into walls and furniture.
* No mopping capabilities.
* Very sensitive cliff sensor which refused to go on very light gray carpet.

Roborock S7

* Silicone side spinner kept getting tangled in the carpet rendering the vacuum useless. Apparently there is 3rd parties selling alternative spinners that are not made out of silicone.
* Even with the side spinner removed, the roborock does a terrible job on carpet. When on carpet and it runs into something with it's bumper, it turns rather than backs up, which makes it grind against the object and gets it stuck frequently.

**What I Need**

* Mop capabilities, doesn't need to be perfect.
* Medium to low pile carpets capabilities, doesn't need to be perfect.
* Lidar.
* Object avoidance.
* Price doesn't matter, but obviously want something that's worth the value."
"Roborock S7+, Roomba J7+ + Bravaa m6 or wait for S7 MaxV? Please help me for my decisionHey,  


I'm actually (and for the last months) looking for a vacuum robot AND (maybe) robot mop.  
3 choose are actually on my sight :

* The Roborock S7+
* The Roomba J7+ (maybe in combo with the Bravaa M6)
* The Roborock S7 MaxV with its new dock, that is not released yet

But I can't decide, I don't really see the differences between all of these choices.

Here is my situation :

* I live in a house
* I have 2 dogs (one big, one small)
* I have several rooms
* My house is relatively connected (with google assistant)

I'm new in this domain, I never had a vacuum robot before and really want to do the right choice as it is really expensive. My goal is to let my house be automatic from A to Z (as far as I can). So here are my questions :

* Is hybrid vacuum/mop robot a good solution or is the mop thing gadget in this case?
* Does Bravaa have an auto clean, or do I need to clean it myself each time?
* What are the real differences between theses vacuum robot
* And finally, which one is the good choice?  


Thank you for your help. I also accept every single suggest or information you can give me, even other vaccum robot alternative"
"Narwal Freo, the next generation Narwal set to be released on September 15th, here are a few early shots from reviewers![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfhFQ2yZOuI)

[The Freo is circular in shape and is a 2 in 1](https://preview.redd.it/xvg6a1ux5jn91.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7244e255a10dfa69dd3c81f49b36fdbcf45f2c95)

The Freo has a brush roll and auto-lifting mopping pads. It also has a touchscreen on the dock which is so darn cool and I hope Roborock and others will add this feature. There is probably also a voice assistant called Freo, but I am unsure as this has only been unveiled in Japan.

"New to Robot Vacuums — which is best?I recently purchased an intro robot vacuum, a Roomba 615, in preparation for getting a dog. I’m officially converted, but feel there is room for improvement and am thinking about exchanging this model.  

It often gets stuck on our floor grilles, which is a dealbreaker (it actually just got stuck as I type this). We can’t turn off the cliff sensor because we have stairs and a large landing. The vacuum would certainly jump to its death without the cliff sensor. I realize a vacuum with mapping may help prevent this. Another thing is that the 615 is a bit loud. We mostly have vinyl plank flooring with some low pile rugs. We are going to get a dog soon, so pet hair is the biggest concern. Our space is also small, so self-emptying doesn’t seem necessary.  

I’m not looking to invest in a high end model yet as this is still new to us, but I’m prepared to exchange for a mid-range or comparable model. What would you recommend?  

Currently, these other models are on sale:  
- Shark ION Tri-Brush Robot Vacuum Cleaner  
- Shark EZ Robot Vacuum with self-emptying base"
"Help! Connectivity issues with Shark IQ XL self emptyHello, I’ve had the vacuum for a few days and things had been fine. Connected to wifi no problem, the vacuum was mapping the house and returned to the base. Later on in the day, I noticed in the app “can’t connect to robot” I tried the trouble shooting and it hasn’t worked. Anyone experienced this or have tips please and thank you!"
"Debris stuck on brush instead go went into the bin Hi Guys, I have had a Morse Robo Vacuum for like almost 3 years. Working fine so far until recently, the Robo starts making weird things. All the dust, debris and hair that suck by the Robo was stuck on the brush instead of going inside the bin. This has caused me a lot of problems as I have to clear the brush more frequently than usual (twice a week). After performing a few tests like swapping the brush to a new one, cleaning the whole robot vacuum (including dissembling the machine), it looks like it was not fixing the issue. A 1 month of experiment was carried out to see how much dust was collected in the bin, and just like the title said all of the dust was stuck on the brushes instead of sucked into the bin. Could anyone please help me or suggest any solution?  
Thanks in advance!

"Dreametech Z10 Pro, Roomba J8+, or Roborock Q7+I have been doing hours upon hours of comparison video watching etc… 

I do not need nor care about mopping features. 

We have a German Shepherd who sheds an insane amount and two kids under the age of two. Which vacuum do you all recommend? (If you recommend one outside of the three I’m asking, just state why it would be better please, thank you!)

Edit: We have also had the Neato D7 for three years now and don’t mind having to empty the bin if that helps anyone recommending…


***~30 DAY UPDATE***

This thing has been incredible. It’s extremely quiet. It’s user interface is almost flawless and it’s setup is so easy. We have only come down to find it stuck one time and it was because I forgot to tuck the laces of my boots in and it sucked up the edge of the laces and pulled the whole boot with it. It does a really good job navigating the house and actually picking up debris, hair, etc.

One thing we especially love is, if one of our toddlers moves the base it doesn’t lose its mind. It just re-attempts to find it and parks itself. Our Neato if you moved the base, AT ALL, you had to create an entire new layout because it had no idea where it was in time and space.

We are loving this thing and are very happy that we bought the vacuum only option."
"Help with deebot mopping plateI just ran my Deebot N8 Pro+ in mopping mode for the first time, and now am struggling to remove the mop pad plate from the reservior.  Am I supposed to remove it?

"Recommend/Help Me Choose a Vacuum?So I've been thinking about getting a robot vacuum and have been watching tons of reviews and trying to get a strong feel for what's the best and what's a solid value as well. At this point it feels like 4 of them have come out on top, but all have different price points and different positives and negatives and I'm suspecting there's some positives and negatives I'm not aware of. Hoping people can chime in with reasons to get one model or not get one specifically, but without further ado, these are the ones I'm looking at:

Shark AI RV2502AE ($350-450)

Pros: Bagless self empty station

New LIDAR mapping may be improved

Solid specs

Cons: Not a lot of reviews. The older IQ had mapping issues for some people and software issues for some. 

Some tests had the older IQ not picking up as much as it could or should.

No mop attachment

Ecovacs N8 Pro+ ($400-500)

Pros: Has LIDAR and obstacle detection
Has a mopping attachment
Highly recommended by others

Cons: Needs a bag for the self empty base

May not be the best cleaner out there and trying to do too much in one.

IRobot Roomba J7+ ($600-700)

Pros: Highly recommended by others for picking up a lot

Senses when bin is full and goes back to base automatically (though others can be set to do this every 30 mins and this likely isn't an issue for me/my space)

Cons: No mop attachment

No LIDAR scanning, just a camera and object recognition.

Needs a bag for the self empty base.

Pricier than the other 2 by a decent margin.

Roborock S9+ ($750+)

Pros: This vacuum seems to have it all, mopping, lidar, obstacle avoidance, etc. And it is well reviewed, though not always at the top.

Cons: Price is close to double what others charge

Needs a bag for the self empty base.


Deep down I feel like it's really between the Ecovacs and the Shark for me, but I'm wondering what makes the J7+ so we'll recommended, is it just marketing or does it have something I'm overlooking or just work head and shoulders above the cheaper options?"

"help a guy choose a robothi all and thanks for help :)

thinking of getting a robot and i have a few choices like

roborock s6 pure

roborock s5 max

360 s10 

i chose to ask about these but there are others and suggestions are welcome

i have a couch that has 10 cm clearance and i would like if it can go under also. now i dont know how these work and if they can ""see"" that there is enough room or if its close enough they wont go under.

will they?  

got some laminate floors and some tiles, and a small 5mm carped under my chair where pc is, so basicaly no carpet and hard floors

i have never had a robo  vaccum so i dont really know what to expect besides forum comments, but i dont beleive they will mop properly so its a secondary function. it seems i cant even find a robot without moping.

so wich one of these would be better for cleaning(more vacuum then mop altho it would be nice if this feature worked fine)? how are they mechanicaly, can i expect trouble and repairs? how is xiaomi warrant vs 360 warranty? 

these are not cheap and dont wanna get pick wrong :) also any sugestions are welcome

thanks!

"Help Wiring DEEBOT Robot VacuumDoes anybody know where I could take my DEEBOT Robot Vacuum to fix the wiring.

I think there is a singular wire that came undone that I cannot figure out where it connects to."
"Help please! Roborock S5 Max, Ecovacs N8+ or Dreame Bot Z10Hi

I've been looking for a robot vacuum and mop for many months, have done heaps of reading of this forum and online reviews, and am overwhelmed by the options available!

I live in a small apartment with mainly tile (and one carpeted bedroom). I have a puppy but he is non-shedding so long hairs are not an issue for me. My main requirement is for a robot that vacuums and mops as I'm sick and tired of having to do both daily (my puppy goes to the toilet on the balcony and then comes in so I have paw prints and pee on my tile floors. I've started wiping his paws with gentle puppy wipes which is helping). I don't need to worry about deep grime on the floors I think.

Ideally I would like the Roborock S7+ as it is the best mop by consensus, but I can't justify spending $1700+ so I've narrowed it down to these Black Friday deals:  
Dreame Bot Z10 for $825 ([https://dreame.com.au/products/dreame-z10-pro](https://dreame.com.au/products/dreame-z10-pro)[?](https://dreame.com.au/products/dreame-z10-pro?variant=40448017399979&currency=AUD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAiA4veMBhAMEiwAU4XRr7M3ZZoM8C77-8iRx6veCQYU5HG5wNS9JWg8AAZ1y6jB5p4VS5W6UxoCyAMQAvD_BwE))  
Ecovacs Deebot N8+ for $749 ([https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08W519SKC/](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08W519SKC/))  
Roborock S5 Max for $749 ([https://www.amazon.com.au/Roborock-S5-Navigation-Selective-Cleaning/dp/B08XC5MFZ4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Roborock-S5-Navigation-Selective-Cleaning/dp/B08XC5MFZ4)?)  


I would like the auto empty dock (Ecovacs and Dreame) and of course the Roborock S5 Max doesn't come with one. I'm not too fussed about obstacle avoidance as I tend to keep my apartment clutter free, so I think mopping will be the most important feature for me, and I'd also like reusable mop pads to keep ongoing costs down. I've read about the mapping issues with Ecovacs but I don't think this will be an issue for me as my apartment is quite small and obviously single level.

Does anyone have any insight or advice about which of these three will be best for me?"
"Shark AI ultra 2 in 1 vs roomba combo j7+I can’t find anything helpful online but I want to know the difference in terms of cleaning and mopping quality between the two vacuums, because the price difference is big but the quality doesn’t seem different"
"Best robo vaccum/mop combo?I just got my second dog, and it’s time to upgrade my 10 year old gen1 roomba. It doesn’t pick up hair, or clean much of anything like it used to. I want to look into a vaccum/mop combo if I can, and ideally I want it to be self emptying. It’s not a must, but would be helpful as I have a busy life. I definitely don’t want to spend 1k+. What are some good knock off/other brands that may be worth looking into?"
"Shark RV915S: Error #2 for no apparent reasonI've run my new Shark robo-vac a couple times, and this Error #2 is plaguing me. It has happened a couple times when there is no apparent cause. I pick the thing up, clear any debris from the undercarriage, pull the yuck off of the brush, spin the wheels and the whiskers to make sure they're clear, but when I put it back down and hit resume, it just gives the message again.

Doing this a few times eventually seems to do the trick. But as the proud owner of a new robot vacuum cleaner that takes this much babysitting to do its one job, I'm wondering if it's worth it. The whole point is to run while I'm at work, when I can't sit around and babysit it all the time.

Are they all this helpless and frustrating? 

I actually really like the thing when it works. The trouble is, it hasn't actually successfully completed a single task yet, without significant help from me."

"Can the suction power just drop dramatically, and what would cause this?I have been very satisfied with my Dreame F9 until recently.

It's basic in terms of features, but had everything I need and cleaned well.

Then all of a sudden I started noticing that it's main brush was full of stuck dust. It would then leave this dust on edges of carpets, or whenever it climbed anywhere. It's compartment was much less full as well.

I tested it with some fine grain cereals and it just leaves a trail of them as it goes away. 

I first changed the main brush and the filter. No luck. I tried a more expensive brush (which looked, felt and weighted exactly the same as the aliexpress replacements I got), but this does not help.

No error are reported.

Currently awaiting for the response from the seller and Dreame. They are taking their sweet time as my warranty has just expired (after I contacted them).

"Shinebot -- no water being vacuumedHas anyone got a Shinebot that picks up water that's worked for more than six months?

I bought a W455 model a while back, and for the first two months it was fine.  About one tank in and one dirty water tank of output.  However starting about at the two month mark the dirty water pickup rapidly went down.  At the moment, a full clean water tank (500ml?) results in about 2-4 tablespoons of dirty water being vacuumed up. Most of the water is on the floor.  I've been following the maintenance and cleaning schedules exactly.

A shame that this is the only mopper on the market that I'm aware of that actually has the spray & vacuum style clean (as opposed to rubbing dirty water around with pads).  Bring back the Scooba! Or perhaps there's an idea for a kickstarter here.

Anyone else seen this?  Any solutions?"
"XClea not docking, help"
"Overwhelmed with choices, would love some help!Hey all.  Apologies that this is likely the 10000th post like this but I've just read so much and looked at so many robot vacuums that I'm kind of overwhelmed. I've never owned one but my partner and I decided this would be a shared Christmas present this year.  Here's a little bit about what we are looking for:

&#x200B;

\- Ideally, we'd like to spend 150-300 dollars

\- We're relatively clean people and we don't smoke or have pets so pet hair power isn't a big deal for us

\- We live in a house with hardwood floors and medium-ish pile carpet.  We also have an area of hardwood that has a shag rug on it.  Not super long, but a bit higher than our carpet.

\- We have an upstairs and a downstairs so if there is room mapping involved, I'd like it to be able to store numerous areas.

\- Mopping really isn't important to us.  

\- Our wi-fi uses an extender that splits into 2 networks.  Generally coverage is pretty good with just 1 single network but we've noticed it gets a little spotty in certain parts of certain rooms so we bought an extender.  

&#x200B;

Beyond all that, I don't know quite enough about robot vacuums to know which features are really handy or unnecessary so if you might have any insight on that, I would appreciate it!  Thanks for any help you can provide.   So many of them are on sale right now on Amazon so I feel like I'd like to buy sooner than later."

"Roomba J8+ vs Shark AV2501SMy mother has been interested in getting a robo vacuum for quite a while but doesn't want to spend the money.

I'm going to buy one for her for christmas

I know these two are likely in two different categories based on pricing but I am more interested in the differences and what you guys think the better value is.

The Roomba at Costco I believe is $599
Vs
The shark on Amazon is $298

My parents currently only have a cat, but will likely be adding a dog in the near future, house is a good mix of hardwood/carpet

Ideally I would like whatever is going to be most self sufficient and reliable 

Edit: any suggestions outside these two are more than welcome! 

Appreciate any help!"
"Problems with the newly bought Dreame F9 cleaning botI bought a new Dreame F9 cleaning bot last week. I haven't been able to make it work fully. Below are the problems faced.

1. The robot cleans a small area in a crazy pattern. It moves backward a lot hitting obstacles. And in some time, it says cleaning completed. Next time when the cleaning is restarted, it follows a different pattern in a different area (sometimes the same area also). I was hoping that this way it was building up the map. But the map doesn't seem to be accurate with respect to the position of the base station. Also, it's taking a lot of time to do this small area. So it does small areas with some overlap every time and says cleaning is completed.
2. There are 2 big problems with the bot.
   1. It never finds the base station. Even if the bot is just starting the cleaning, if I give a return to base command, it cannot find the base station. It goes all over the place and finally, voice prompt says to move the bot to the base station. 
   2. Every 5 minutes or so, the bot stops with a voice message ""obstacle detected, please reposition"". And the bot will be in an open area with no obstacles at all. And it's very frustrating because it happens almost every 5-10 minutes. If I just give the resume cleaning option in the app, it continues cleaning normally for the next 5-10 minutes.

Tried solutions:

1. Cleaned the base station and the bot (sensors).
2. Factory reset the bot and reinstalled the app.
3. Moved the base station to a lot of different positions which included a very open area also.
4. Tried in day and night conditions with different lighting.

None of this worked. Has anyone faced these kinds of problems with Dreame F9 or Xiaomi robot and how did you fix it?

Any pointers will be helpful. Thanks!"
"Need help. Hello! I have the mi robot vacuum-mop. The last time I wiped the whole house after it was done it moved the dock, in the app from the room called the storage room to the room called the toilet. I tried to restore it and did  the following, 1. I took the dock out of the socket, put it back in, 2. I restarted the device, 3. I moved the dock in a third room, pressed the return button on the app so the robot return on the dock. None of this worked. Is there a way without having to map from the beginning? Thanks!"

"Shark AI robot won’t stay connected to Wi-FiBought a new shark AI robot. Since my router is dual band and had a “Guest” Wi-Fi option to make a separate Wi-Fi, I made a separate Wi-Fi network just for the vacuum and only 2.4 band since that’s what it supports only. However the vacuum will just disconnect from the Wi-Fi after a few hours. I tried switching it to the main Wi-Fi which is 5Ghz and 2.4 and it’s the router that decides what band to put it on. Same issue. Router is an archer AX11000. Internet speeds of 1gbps up and down. Robot is across the room from the router itself with no obstructions. 

I’ve tried changing the guest wifi to 5Ghz only, setting guest Wi-Fi to both bands, taking battery out and putting it back in, nothing works. I have to press and hold both the dock and clean buttons for the vacuum to say “ready to connect to Wi-Fi” and re-add it to on my app (using an iPhone 13P max). Works for a few hours, then just disconnects. 

Any help?"

"Narwal Freo vs dreametech L10As the title says, I was wondering if you guys had any ideas on the Narwal Freo vs the Dreamtech L10s Ultra.

Based on stated features, 1 difference I see between the Freo and Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra is that the Dream empties its dustbin. I have a iRobot Roomba i3 with the auto emptying base and the Cordey without an auto emptying bin... I do forget to empty Cordey sometimes and it doesn't clean when I forget to empty it... I have the mop attachment, but it does get dirty and it's just dragging the cleaning pad around even after being dirty.

Based on the stated features of the Dream and Freo, both have spinning brushes, both lift the brushes when on carpet, both have dirty and clean chambers for cleaning the brushes, both use heat to dry the brushes... The only difference (which I really like) is that the Dream auto empties the dustbin...

I only don't know much about the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra and their brand. I don't know how well they are at mapping and the obstacle avoidance compared to the stated good of the Narwal Freo. Based on the readings I've done, the Freo is pretty smart and is a really good robot vacuum. The only downside is the lack of auto emptying...

I guess I want to know if anyone had any experience with any Dreamtech products (like the W10 or something) and can say how good the app and features are. I don't want to shell out a ton of $ on an item only to wish I got the Freo even though it lacks the auto empty bin. I just am not always there, and I can't run the Roomba when I'm not home as it likes to get stuck...a lot... I'd do Cordey, but I have to get some magnet strips to tell it not to go in certain places as it doesn't get stuck unless it gets physically stuck under furniture that's too tight for it to fit under. Roomba just randomly gets ""stuck"" on nothing, and if I'm gone for say a couple of days, I can't auto empty Cordey or Freo, and those would have been the only 2 I would have trusted to run while I'm not home.

&#x200B;

So, does anyone have the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra, or any Dreamtech products? Are they any good? I'm really trying to compare to the Narwal Freo as it's the alternative for me. For all I know, I may just wait until the next Black Friday... I can't believe the prices...but I only just learned about those today. The different Narwals first, then the Dreamtech's Dream Bot  So, any help would be great. You will have some time. I'll try not to impulse buy any of them until I hear about them both. Narwal would have been a no brainer had it had the auto empty feature. I need to see more reviews on the Dreamtech's Dream Bot to decide if it's good or not...

&#x200B;

Also...anyone who has the Narwal Freo...Have you tried refilling the detergent with your own cleaning solution? Has it worked? Was it easy to do?  I have a cleaner I use on my wood floors that I usually put in my Cordey that's for wood floors. Was seeing if I could put that in there, or maybe not. It's concentrated wood cleaner, so I'd have to mix it with water if anything anyway. "
"Recommendations for a basic needs vacAny recommendations for a reliable but basic robot vac? 

My goal is to maintain daily pet hair (1 mixed breed dog) cleanup between weekly cleanings. It doesn’t have to mop or have a dust bin but ok with either.  Three rooms - 600-800 sq ft is my very rough guess for space.

I’d say budget is $400 max, I will run it daily but don’t expect perfection.

Any help is appreciated, I’ve been lurking here for a while but trying to sort through the posts and information is a bit overwhelming."

First post here so I apologize if asking for advice like this is frowned on.

I’m looking for a vacuum for our two bedroom house. About 1000 sq ft. Short haired dog.

Both vacuums are on sale at Walmart with about $100 difference. To me, the hundred dollar jump is worth it for bin and mop (even if it’s mediocre).

I’ve heard great things about Wyze, and 50/50 on the t8+. Obviously they are very different prices when not on sale so there are no direct comparisons online. 

My main concerns for the t8+ is the app and the bin.

"Is there a zero warranty use robovac buying strategy? For folks that use Valetudo, chemicals, import their robotvac, or have a dreame?I want to hear from folks who assume their warranty is void—either because they’re using Valetudo, cleaning chemicals, or they bought their vac from a different country than they use it in. Or they have a Dreame which reportedly has terrible service. 

Do you assume you’ll have to replace it if something goes wrong, and budget accordingly?

After weeks of research I was all set to buy a Roborock Q7max today and realized the brand won’t ship to the Caribbean. So if I acquire one elsewhere, and buy and use in different countries, the warranty is instantly void. So far no company I’ve checked out ships directly to my country. Except some aliexpress vendors. 

It’s not a disposably priced item for my budget. And I assume the app or wifi connection will rat my location out (can I use a VPN?).

Should I go for very low price units, assuming I’ll have to replace if something goes wrong? 

Or Roomba, since they’ll have the most user replaceable parts for self repair? 

Or a not wifi connected model?

Any recommendations? 

*Vendors I’ve checked for Caribbean shipping and the purchase country=use country warranty rule are: Roborock, iLife, roidmi, roomba"

Now it is even not cleaning whole boxes i instruct it to clean via app. It is doing a triangle and says it is ready and goes back to charge. It has a full battery so it for sure has enough charge.

"Desperate advice needed! Best heavy duty robot vaccum/mop for house with two messy rabbitsMe and my partner adopted two house rabbits. We have tried our damn best to litter train them, but there is still wee on the hardwood livingroom floor, and vinyl kitchen floor every day. Luckily they do not wee on the small section of carpet near the stairs, but they poop there lots.

It takes at least an hour every day to mop up, sweep/hoover up the poops, and brush up all of the hay that spreads around the house.

I was lead to believe that they would be litter trained, and the mess wouldn't be so bad, but we are really struggling to cope with it. (But don't worry, they are loved and well looked after, its just that we are loosing the little free time/energy we have after work on nothing but cleaning).

I understand that automation will not fully solve this. We will still need to manually empty their litter trays, manually sweep/mop up their rabbit run (a sectioned off area that they are free to go in and out of, that they do the worst of their mess in), and sweep up any particularly bad areas as we find them.

But it will help with my peace of mind knowing that the floors are regularly mopped, as currently the rabbits stand in their wee and spread it through the house. And if it can get the little bits of hay (not the big collection that congregates in their run), that will also help and make this task less arduous for us.

We have decided to not get each other Christmas presents this year so we can get a robot hoover/mop instead, but as it's such a big/expensive decision, and I'm still not convinced it will cope with the mess, we haven't bought it yet.

Can you please help me decide on a brand/model?

**Our budget is about £600** ($731), but if it absolutely needs to be higher than this for it to be any use, we might be able to afford this if we have to.

Required features/qualities:

* Hoover and Mop
* Heavy duty (can cope with hay/rabbit poop)
* High quality (we cannot afford to buy cheap, we need something that will last us a long time, and we do not need to upgrade later)
* Good navigation - the vinyl kitchen floor is easy, it's just a square with a mesh cage in the corner with a raised door that the rabbits hop through. The Hoover will just do the non cage bit. The living room is harder, it's an open living/dining area with lots of obstacles and a wooden beam in the middle.
* Maybe self emptying if you think this is necessary for this situation? With the amount of mess,  I can foresee needing to empty the hoover/mop many times in one day, and I can foresee this being another task that I procrastinate,making the whole thing useless.

(Btw, for those that don't know, rabbit poops are hard little balls of mostly compressed hay. They are not wet or mushy)

We will be moving house in 6 months as our landlady wants her son to move in, so we will get a house with a garden then. But for these 6 months, some robot help will be great. And I'm sure it will still be useful in our new place, as the rabbits will have playtime in the house. 

Thank you!"

I was wanting to go as cheap as possible but I feel like my floor plan might not work with random and I feel like the amount of human and cat fur might require auto empty. I can probably get my housemates to empty the thing. 

Scheduled starts are essential.

"Best robot vacuum for...Hi everyone,  


I'm interested in purchasing a robot vacuum but I'm having trouble deciding which one.  


1. The majority of my house is hardwood floors, I would like them to be clean and moped ideally. I've read that on some models the mopping does not work well or leaves streaks. Should I be concerned and no matter what model I get, I will have to mop separately?   

2. Is it worth it investing in a higher end model? Or are the features overhyped for my needs of clean and mop hardwood floors, I have no pets and we are only a couple living together.  

3. I was thinking of the Roborock s5 or s7 and was also looking at a lower or mid range Eufy by Anker.  I've bought Anker products before and they seem to have good warranty, customer service which I'm impressed with. I  have seen the Roborock got good reviews but I'm not sure about the warranty and have heard the machines breaking after 6 months to a year which makes me hesitant to purchase.  

4. What could you recommend as the best model for cleaning and mopping hardwood floors? No kids and no pets.  

5. I would like something that has a removeable dust bin as I view buying bags as a additional cost and cash grab, am I right to assume this?

"Another 'help deciding' threadHello everyone,
Also looking to purchase my first robovac, budget I would say is for around 250. It's quite hard to decide on a model, reviews are so very variable!
One thing that I would like with it is the mopping feature; while I know it isn't meant to deep clean, done regularly by the bot, we would not have to mop every single week hopefully.
So far, my main options is either the dreametech d9 or the roborock e4 (s5 max is just outside the budget). I am inclined towards the d9 right now for the lidar navigation, it is slightly more that the roborock but I feel the lidar is a major upgrade.
Any first hand experience or alternatives?

"Shark “your map isn’t available” in historyI have a RV2000WD which has a mapping functionally.   It explores and builds the map just fine, but any time I run, it the cleaning report never shows where it cleaned.  It just says “your map isn’t available”. 

The instructions says to start it from the dock (I did) and remove any obstacles.  Well other than furniture there are no obstacles.

On a side note, I turned it off for a few months and the house map disappeared from the app.  I needed to delete the map and have it re-explore.  That’s unrelated as the cleaning report map never worked even before that."
"Roborock S7 without station or Dreame D10 Plus with stationHello Everyone! I was wondering if you could help me to make a choice.

I really like the idea of not having to empty the vacuum everyday. I live in a relatively small apartament with another person and also, we don’t have pets. So, object avoidance is also not important.

The mopping function is not a priority but I just want to make a good choice and go for the better option. So, which do you think I should choose for the price?

"Ecovacs Deebot T10+ - Is it worth buying?Hey all, I am looking to purchase my first robot vac and landed on the T10+. It seems to be the most feature-packed at this price range and also has a really good discount going on in Best Buy right now. Compared to the roborock s7+ which is similarly priced, I like the fact that it has obstacle avoidance since parts of my floor are covered with wires. However, looking through the reddit comments, it seems like there are a lot of problems with ecovacs vacuums. I was hoping some of you may have tried this new model and can help answer a few questions:

1. Did they fix the issues with mapping (maps not being saved or getting skewed) and sensor malfunctions with the new models?
2. Does the object recognition work well, especially with wires?
3. On that note, is the AIVI tech a substantial improvement over the laser based object avoidance in the T8+? The T8+ is also being heavily discounted right now and is $200 cheaper. $100 cheaper with the Ozmo pro attachment.
4. Does it work with washable microfiber mops and are they readily available?

* Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop 2 Pro (€305)

We do need mapping so the vacuum doesn't get lost, and we're looking for something that won't need to run into things to know they're there.  
We **don't** need it to have the self empty bit. Yeah, it's cool but we can handle it.

Our hearts do break that Roborock doesn't ship to Canada, otherwise we wouldn't be asking for assistance, or looking at the Shark or Roomba."
"Replacement for Roomba 400 SeriesOur old Roomba is beginning to deserve its retirement after many years of service. As the options have increased over the years I am now a little lost while looking for a replacement. It should be able to do the following:

-	Create maps and on demand cleaning of specific areas 


-	Map at least two floors 


-	Self empty station 


-	On demand cleaning 


-	Very good obstacle avoidance


-	Handle more than 60 m^2 (500-600 sqft)


It doesn’t need the following features:


-	Wet cleaning 


-	Voice assistant 


-	Any video surveillance shenanigans



If anyone can recommend something I’d be grateful, price isn’t much of an issue but if I can save something by dropping the unnecessary features it’d be great. Thanks for the help."
"Suggestions on models for house with pet hair?We have 2 dogs, both long hair and shedding. We also have 2 cats. We are looking for our first robot vaccum to help cut down on the dog hair floating around. This would be for the main floor only, with a mix of hardwood, medium pile carpet, low pile carpet and a few rugs. 

I'd like to find something with the following specs:

2000pa or higher
LIDAR
Google Home integration with scheduling
Self emptying
$300usd or less

Things I definitely do not want:

Mop capabilities
General wear parts that are not user replaceable

I've found the Eufy G40+ which fits most of these with the exception of LIDAR. Also looking at a Shark AV2511AE. Is there anything I'm missing?"
Ultraclean not workingWe have the Shark RV2600WD Shark AI Ultra 2in1 and the ultraclean option is not available on the app. It has worked in the past. I've re-seated both the dust bin and the mop pad reservoir and I still don't have the ultraclean option on the app. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
"Robot applicationHello Everyone! My parents asked my help to buy a robot for their house. I have a ikohs NetBot LS23 robot, which was something I would recommend them, but they have a request that my robot can’t fulfill. 
They need a robot that can be controlled via application by more than one person. Unfortunately, my NetBot can only be controlled by one person. 
I’ve been searching online, but it’s very hard to find information regarding the application for the different robot brands. 
Can someone with experience in other brands tell me if their apps allow for more than one user controlling the robot? Or at least where can I find that kind of information?
Thanks in advance!"

"Just moved home to take care of Mom - looking for a robo vac!My wife and I just moved in with my 92 year old mother to take care of her. She has always been a stickler for house work and that hasn't changed, so I have been thinking about buying a robot vacuum cleaner... so I don't have to do it any more. :-)

I have some fairly specific needs and questions. If anyone has time to answer any of these, or make a recommendation, that would be awesome!

* I LOVE robots and ""gadgets"". Looking for something a bit... techy? (Roborock's Lidar navigation sounds cool!) Being able to return to the charger is a must. The self emptying bags are neat, too, but not a requirement. I'm also intrigued by the cameras.
* Mom's house is probably 2500 square feet, main floor and furnished basement. (So it might be nice to have a robot that can support multiple floors?)
* We don't currently have any pets
* Most of the house is carpeted (low pile) but the kitchen is tile
* The wife is very skeptical about the whole thing, so my budget is probably around $500

**QUESTIONS:**

1. My Mom's vision is pretty good but my wife is worried that the robot might trip her. I said that we could probably have it run at night. Has this been an issue for anyone?
2. If we don't get a robot with a self emptying bag, do you need to clean/empty the robot after each clean?
3. I've heard that some robots destroy tassels on area rugs. Are some models worse about this than others? Here's a pic:

[I put down 2 quarters and a penny for scale](https://preview.redd.it/pkzo61t60iw81.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12b2e6c8f0800a827178925ab849ce1eb95bfbf7)

Here are a couple of the robots I'm currently looking at:

**Roborock S6 MaxV**

I like that it supports multiple floors, has Lidar navigation, includes a great app with lots of features, and has a camera to help avoid cords and things on the floor.

**Shark IQ Robot Self-Empty XL R101AE**

I just started looking into this robot due to it's self emptying bin. Not sure if it supports multiple floors. I don't think it has a camera.

**UPDATE: Roomba J7+**

Based on feedback I have just started looking at the Roomba J7+. I like that it seems to work better on low pile carpets, but the main appeal is the self-emptying feature. Really like the sound of that. :-)"
"Help! Dog Poop Nightmare Shark XL Self Empty Robot Vacuum!Hi all!

As a pet owner this is the most terrifying fear of having a robot vacuum..... poop

So I purchased a Shark XL Self Empty Robot Vacuum for my mom as a housewarming gift back in December.  She LOVES LOVES LOVES it.  We’ve had the dog poop in the house and the vacuum run over it twice now.  The first time we tried to clean it but it didn’t work so we were able to exchange it because it was under warranty.  Today it happened again and it’s no longer under warranty.  We took the battery out, cleaned it again (carefully) and now the vacuum is hanging out drying.  In a couple days when we’re going to try it again.

Does anyone have any advice?  If it doesn’t work can I get it repaired?  Return it/exchange it through some type of loop hole?

I really don’t want to have to go buy a whole new vacuum because of dog poop.  It’s expensive enough!

Thanks!!"
"Need help to find the best Robot Vacuum CleanerHello there,

I'm currently in the quest of finding the best vacuum cleaner for 300€ but with so much references and new one appearing every month I don't really know which to choose so here I am, asking for your help !

I'm living in a 80m² flat with a cat that is losing a ton of hair (yes that is the main reason I want a robot).

I don't really care if it also do the mop, it sure is a plus if it does but during my (rather short) research I've seen that in most of the time, robot that vacuum and mop aren't the best in this budget (correct me if I'm wrong).  


So here I am, looking for a 300€ (+/- 100€) robot, that will take care of my cat hair and if possible a mop functionnality, have you got some things to share with me ?  


Thanks a lot in advance for your help, and I'm sorry for any english mistakes I may have done, it is not my native language."
"Your advice - which Roborock should I get? or another brand?Hello everyone, I'd much appreciate your advice on the roborock's vacuums as I never had a robot vacuum before but I can't stand vacuuming everyday anymore. I decided on the Roborock brand as I have some friends that have the s7 and they say it's great but I read that this model is not so good with pet hair?

Their website is not helpful either to understand the difference of their models... Our house is 100sqm and is hard floor. We have 2 rugs

What is an absolute must for me: 

* The robot needs to be able to vacuum long hair: I have 2 long haired cats, a British long hair and a Siberian. Their shedding is no joke.. I fill a dyson v10 every 2 days with their hair and the house is still a mess
* I really like the idea of the mop feature if this actually works - does it work?
* No bags - I switched to dyson because of the emptying system that is so easy and doesn't require a bag. I saw that many robot vacuums need bags. I want the easiest way possible to empty the robot and not have to purchase separate parts like bags, does that exist?

Maybe I should be looking at a different brand? The price is not really an issue if I can get one that responds to all the points above

Thank you, I really appreciate your help!!"

Dreametech D10 Plus vs Roomba i7+I am looking to get my first robo vac. I live in a 1100 sq ft house with 2 cats. Mix of hardwood with rugs and carpets. I have found both of these for around $350 and cant decide which one is better. From what I've read each have positives and negatives. Any help would be appreciated.
"New 360 owner to help others.I'm posting this for others as a source of information for this brand/model. I recently purchased the 360 S7 Pro from Amazon. I previously had the Neato D4 which I returned due to its lack of features I was looking for in a robot vac.

As I researched what to buy before and after the D4 I found myself having trouble finding reliable sources of reviews or in the 360's case just reviews. After finding one S7 Pro review on YouTube (that seemed like a non paid spot) and a bunch S9 reviews, I decided to pull the trigger. This was decided mostly based on specs/features to price. At the time of my purchase it was $290 after $100 discount. For that I got all the app features of a modern bot vac, multi floor maps, no go zones for vac and mop, clean rooms in w/e order I want (this was a BIG factor to me), and the vac itself was 2650pa suction.

Performance wise 360 says it's equivalent to the Roborock S5 Max. Idk if that helps you but I never owned a RR, though I read a lot of reviews saying it's carpet performance is ehh. The S7 Pro does quite well on our low pile carpets. Actually it seems to pick up more then the Neato which is surprising since the Neato brush is almost twice as big. I guess that PA does come in handy. It cleans all surfaces very good, though I think I would prefer RR rubber side brush then the bristles. I'm debating a way to use those on the 360. Nothing a dremal couldn't handle.

The navigation has been 100% spot on. Especially compared to the Neato and its lost in a circle actions. If I tell it to do the Living Room at Max power 2x then the playroom at powerful power 2x then the hallway at normal suction 1x it does exactly that avoiding all possible obstacles. At 100% suction power it can clean each room twice before it needs to recharge. When you clean the room twice it will go north /south on the 1st run, then east /west on the 2nd. I find this is probably the most efficient way to clean. Before each pass it cleans the borders. 

The dust bin is avg size, I would prefer a larger bin but at this price range the size seems standard. Both the D4 and S7 Pro get over our kitchen threshold which measures .7in. Though the Neato seemed to have less trouble. Our kids are still young enough where gates are needed, neither vac made it over them. Which still requires me to remove the gate or pick up the vac. Still making the idea of a robot vacuum not fully realized in our household.. 

As of this posting the RR S4Max is down to $320, If I wanted I can return the 360 and buy that. I've decided that I'm looking at a downgrade across the board if I do. I'd only be getting a well known brand over a lesser one.

Both are Chinese made, along with the Deebot and basically every brand on Amazon minus Irobot and Neato (Neato was American but was bought by a German company). I put my faith in the 360 and so far its paid off greatly! 

I will update this post if I see a need.

For reference we have 2 dogs and 2 kids."

"Anyone here purchase extra insurance on their vac when purchasing? Like the ones that the vendor offers with purchase? (Asurion, Geeksquad, etc). Any feedback on that? Worth it?I'm about to purchase my first robot vac (a Roborock). Often when I buy things made of a lot of mechanical parts I consider buying insurance. I've never owned a robot vacuum so I don't know how finicking they get after warranty. 

Anyone have any feedback on that? That you'd done it it's been helpful? Do you just rely on credit card free additional warranty?

Just about to buy a Revo on their site, but considering buying it on Amazon so I can get that 3-year of additional warranty. The 3 year Asurion insurance on a $700 robot will probably be around $80. Worth it?"
"Roborock S8 Pro Ultra ReviewI absolutely love my new S8 Pro Ultra.  I owned a horrible Roomba 20 years ago and I feel like I have gone from an iPhone 1 to iPhone 15.  I have a large 2 level house with beagles, different floor types and have a unit servicing each floor.  I plan to run them 2-3x week and be meticulous on the maintenance.  Now only time will tell if the units stay healthy.  Side topic - Anyone else thinks the OMO cleaner smells like blueberry pancakes after a room is mopped? 

Pros: 
- All the automation is seamless and no issues.  The unit just works as advertised with no intervention.  

- The App is very well constructed, great response and easy to use.  I love I can set no go zones and avoid the robot from getting stuck.  

- Vac is very good.  

- Moping is excellent.  Looks like I did it myself.  

- Siri control is awesome for adhoc single room cleaning.  I can rely on the reoccurring schedule while also calling the robot to a specific room if a mess is made.  

- Room mapping is accurate and fast 

- Avoidance is decent.  Not perfect but the unit does navigate well and does a good job of getting out of tight spots

- No issues with onboard bin transfer to the dock bin.  Our dogs shed a ton and so far no blockage.  

Cons:
- (This is more for myself and not the unit) I use a nice reverse osmosis, 4 stage water filtration to supply filtered water.  It’s faster than a distilled machine and can produce 1700ml in about 8mins.  But I do have to spend some time each week refilling the main jug.  

- As said the avoidance is decent.  I would not rely on this unit to avoid poop messes 100% of the time.  But my dogs are grown and trained so I don’t have in house mess issues.  

- I can already tell customer service is going to be a challenge.  On launch they didn’t have any S8 specified bin bags listed on the Roborock site.  The chat tech kept telling me they were not avail despite me asking several times if the S7 bin bags were identical.  Turns out they are identical and they updated their site a week later specifying the S8 also.  I have heard mixed reviews on the China support.  

- Maintenance.  As said a I plan to be meticulous here.  Seems like a full maintenance scrub will be needed monthly for all the various systems.  But this is a minor inconvenience for the automated clean floors.

- Rug/Hardwood Edge mopping is not great because of the lifted mop when transition to carpet.  Which is actually a good thing to not dampen the rugs but the edge mopping is sloppy because of this."
"Are i-robot brand vacuums in general better, or is it mostly Tesla/Apple style hype?I'm just dipping my toes in to this. I kind of want to get a robot vacuum but looking in to it is such a boring chore that it's almost as bad as vacuuming itself. The easy go-to choice for someone with as short an attention span as me is an i-robot vacuum, simply because for decades now their 'roomba' brand has become almost a generic term and they're just by far the most well known.

They also seem to often be the most expensive making them in my mind, the Apple of robot vacuums. That also makes me wonder if there's a decent chance that they don't justify their price tag and simply rely on the brand name associations to keep people paying. But if they really are good, then it would be nice shortcut for me to avoid having to read so many reviews and advertising and a lot of 'reviews' that are advertising because I can maybe restrict my search parameters to mostly irobot or mostly irobot and one or two other well known brands."
"Can LiDAR vacuum bots see through bedspreads?I a number of beds with bedspreads or whatever you call the thing that hangs down from the mattress to the floor.  I have a “dumb” Shark robot vacuum that happily goes through them. 

Will the newer models that use LiDAR go under the bed?"
"Relocating the auto empty dock in a 2-level houseI am currently researching various different brands and models of robot vacuum cleaners which have the auto empty dock feature.

These are the ones I am interested in:
- Rockrock S7 Maxv
- Dreame L10S Ultra

After doing the research, in particular YouTube video reviews, there is one scenario which I have not scene or mentioned in any of the reviews.

Since I have a two-story house, I'm intending to map both levels and I want the robot vacuum cleaner to operate on both levels.

I understand the robot vacuum will need to be lifted and carried to the upper level as obviously it cannot climb a staircase.

After allowing the robot to map both levels in the house, before cleaning operation starts I'm intending to relocate the docking station to the level which I intend to clean. I may do this several times per week.

Note: The need to relocate the auto empty dock to the upper level during a clean would be particularly necessary if I was to purchase the ""Dreame L10S Ultra"", as this particular model relies on the auto empty dock to clean its mopping pads several times during a mopping job. In fact it can be configured to clean after every 10 m² of mopping, which is a pretty good feature in my opinion.

1. Will relocating the dock confuse the robot in any way? 
2. Will it invalidate the mapping?"
"Bissell A3 is almost 1/2 off, I bought one here are my thoughts.As of right now the ready clean mop head changing system is just $350.The TLDR is; I am extremely impressed and, this will replace my Roomba M6 .

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"
"Problem with Roidmi EvaHi,

I‘ve bought a new Roidmi Eva. I’m very happy with the vacuuming and mopping, it’s doing a great job. but I’m having a major issue and don’t know how to solve it.

Let’s say the door to the hallway is closed and he is cleaning another room and scans alongside, he now thinks that there’s a wall to the hallway. When I now want to clean the hallway, he says that he can’t access it. He doesn’t even start to scan if there’s a way, he just say no and don’t start. That’s super frustrating. 

The only way I see is to send him first to another room so he sees that the door is open now. 
But that’s not how I thought the robot will work. I want to chose the room and then rely that he will clean it.

Is there anything I can do about this problem? 

Thank you!"
"iRobot j7+ review video + write up [OC]Hey everyone, we're a little late on this one, but we've finally released our review of the J7+. Check it out on Youtube here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFuuRpJQaic&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFuuRpJQaic&)

There are a few things of interest about this robot to me, in particular.

\- I believe that they're relying more and more on the optical floor tracking sensor - the one used on the i3, more than the front facing camera.  As a result, it's a little more clumsy to watch than other options and takes a few full cycles to create its map.

\- Once again, iRobot haven't increased the suction power so it's now quite far behind some competitors.  They haven't published a suction figure, but I believe it's around 1800pa.  Despite this, it's probably still the best or thereabouts on carpet due to the signature dual-roller set-up.  The dual rollers don't make quite as much difference on hard floors or with bigger items like leaves, but the suction is still sufficient.

\- The vSLAM camera is now mounted on the front of the robot and looks forward, rather than at the ceiling.  As a result, the J7 is the first iRobot to have object detection for things lying on the ground.  It was pretty good - it missed all our dog poo tests and while it caught some cables, it didn't actually get stuck.  Only criticism is that in some cases it was slightly too sensitive and avoided some spots it shouldn't have, but that won't really matter if you're using it regularly and is a fairly common issue with object detection.

\- The new design and base is very cool.  The base is a lot smaller than any of its competitors and is a much better use of space.

Feel free to ask any questions... I'd love if you asked them on Youtube rather than here to help the algorithm ;) I only check the comments here every few days but I'll try answer any questions.

Currently working on our S7 MaxV Ultra review... expect that within the next week or so."
"Vacuum - with best obstacle avoidanceI see the new models come with some ability to avoid obstacles, but I have yet to see one that does it so efficiently that you can rely on it to do a room without getting stuck 9/10 times, with the exception of maybe the new iRobot (forgot the model name), but it had some other downsides that potentially was a dealbreaker for me. Have been holding off for a while in anticipation of these models (got an S5 Max), are there any new models around the block that are expected to be able to do this feature quite well? The current new xiaomi models seem to still be struggling a bit. Any input is appreciated!"
"Dreame Z10 Pro Robot Vacuum and Mop with DockHave you been spending hours and hours reviewing the same robot vacuums over and over to see which one you would like to spend your hard earned money on? Have you still not come to a conclusion yet? Well, I’ll come to that conclusion so you don’t have to!
Enough of the rhetoric, I cannot repeat this enough, but this wonderful machine has changed my life and in this review you’ll see how it can change yours too.

Firstly, I have to note that I have been sent this robot vacuum by Dreame, although I have been told that I can be honest in my review, as they care about the customer feedback and want to make the best possible products on the market.
Furthermore, I am going to write a small bit about me so you can understand the struggles I have with hoovering. I am 21, partially blind, I have psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Aspergers. I have been looking for months upon months, to try and find the best robot vacuum for the price. I cannot see small crumbs an dog hair on the floor so I get incredibly frustrated when it comes to hoovering up because I often miss a lot of debris on the floor and my mum, who works full-time, takes it upon herself to help me do it, and as much as I love my mother, I don’t want to rely on her in that way and I don’t want to take up anymore of her precious time. This is where the good bit comes, I have been eyeballing Dreame’s products for a while and luckily for me, they sent one out to me to show the world that if you struggle like me, this is the perfect robot vacuum for you, whether you have disabilities or just want that added comfort of not having to do the hoovering in your house, because this robot can do it all! 

Upon receiving this product, I noticed that the materials used and the packaging provided was incredibly well put together. I took out the beast-of-a-hoover and right then and there I knew I was going to enjoy hoovering for once. All that you need to do, when taking the hoover out of the box is put in the little spinning brush, it click in with ease and trust me if I can do it, then you can too. 
The product I received came with the docking station, and my oh my it is a wonderful contraption at that, I’ll come back to that a little later. After the small assembly, all I had to do was plug in the dock, ‘press the return to dock’ button on the hoover itself and off it went and rolled up the dock and started charging itself!

I will be honest, I’m currently in a homeless hostel waiting to get my own place, so I am unable to talk about the Wi-Fi connectivity and the app in thorough detail. However, I had a little look and it seems very easy and simple to navigate, with zones you can set for the hoover to avoid, and detailed maps that you can label, so in future you could probably say ‘Alexa hoover kitchen’ lets say and it’ll go and do it for you. There is other benefits of the app I’m sure, but like me, you don’t even have to use the app, all I do right now is press the power button, take the dog for a walk and I return to a lovely, freshly hoovered flat. This is all done through the Xiaomi Home app, which if you don’t know, is an extremely useful app for other devices, such as Xiaomi scooters and other utilities that use the same app. If I’m not mistaken, you can also have up to 3 floor plans on the app as well, so you can take it upstairs and allow it to hoover, its not heavy at all either so don’t worry about pulling your lower back out. 



This bot is one of very few that used LIDAR as well as vSLAM, which in basic terms means that it uses both cameras and sensors, as well as lasers to gather insightful information such as detailed mapping of a room, as well as which obstacles to avoid. It is honestly a sight to behold, especially when you see it avoid something such as the dog  or a dog toy, and it does this all in real-time, it’ll have the maps taken beforehand as a template, but it’ll detect objects on the fly, and this is what makes this product so magnificent. This pinpoint-precision tech tells the hoover where to hoover and what lines to take in order to most efficiently and effectively vacuum. The suction is powerful, it cleans my carpets perfectly and gets those little crumbs, dirt that I can’t see, and even flakes of skin that shed due to my psoriasis too! Effectively the Dreame z10 pro has changed my life for the better.

One important thing to know,  is that this hoover is pretty good with dog hair, I have a Shiba Inu, which sheds a whole lot, and the hoover manages hair quite well, although after a month, you do have to detangle those stray hairs, but Dreame has thought of this and has provided a little detangling/brush tool underneath the back lid of the hoover itself. Furthermore, this little hoover gets into spots that some people with mobility problems will struggle to get into, such as under beds, sofas and tables, getting into those awkward spots so you don’t have to, saving your back in the mean time!

Now, onto the meat and potatoes of this product and why it stands out. The dock. Each bag lasts 60 days, I was given 2, though I think I read somewhere that you get 5, the bags will be available on amazon, and so far I’ve nearly reached 2 months and I still have room to spare, I usually hoover every day. Enough about the bags, onto the dock itself and believe me, you’ll want to purchase this hoover with the dock, it just makes sense! When the hoover has detected that its compartment is full, it goes and empties itself into the dock and then comes back and finishes where it left off, with no guidance or input needed at all and it just looks astounding, almost like a piece of art. If, you don’t buy the hoover with the dock, you’ll have to empty the hoover into a bin yourself and that’s quite arduous and finicky if you ask me, I don’t even know how you’ll charge the hoover without the dock. The obstacle avoidance is really good, it avoids dog toys and even wires, though sometimes it can go over smaller wires, but I’ve never seen wires wrap around the brush roller, so i believe there is a sensor next to the roller itself that detects wires and stops before it sucks them in.

Lastly, the mop is very good, I have a small kitchen and it does the job noticeably well. However, you have to keep taking the mop off and on as and when you want to mop, and in my case, if you’re using the reusable mop, you have to clean it every time, because it is that effective at mopping that it just gets full with dirt after one use. One improvement that could be made, is an automatic lifting device for the mop, so you don’t have to take it off when hoovering over carpets, it detects a carpet and a little motor lifts the whole mop up so your carpet doesn’t get wet, I’ve seen it implemented elsewhere, but paying nearly twice the price for a little lifting device for the mop isn’t worth it. One other small gripe I’d say, is that maybe Dreame could make a bag-less version in the future, so you can just empty the bin and not have to fuss around replacing bags every 2 months, and I would hope that these bags are bio-degradable. However, I’m being very nit-picky and it was very hard to find downfalls in this device, as it is very useful and life-changing for me especially. 

In conclusion, I believe that right now, for the money, this is the best hoover on the market, with the features you get. Even at full price this is a steal, but right now there is a limited early-bird price so definitely check around to see that price. If you’re someone with disabilities or limited mobility then you will greatly benefit from having the Z10, even if you have no disabilities and just want the added ease of coming back from work after a hard day, going on the app and telling your hoover to clean, you’ll come back to a nice hoovered home, which in turn means less stress for you, and to me, that is priceless. I am so thankful that Dreame has bestowed upon me this magnificent product and I hope that many of you enjoy it as much as I have, and that my review helps guide you into knowing which robot vacuum to buy, it is definitely worth it. This is a step into the future, that of autonomy and I’m happy to be a part of it. Dreame is a very forward thinking company and wants to help make peoples lives better as well as easier and I personally look forward to what they have to offer in the future, and you should too, so keep an eye out! I also love how Dreame values the customer, they listen to feedback and want to make the best products based on what the customer wants, and that is so valuable to me and all companies should be like that, I’m very thankful to Dreame for giving me this opportunity, and I hope that my review is appreciated.

"Warning: Samsung is deleting negative reviews from their website + YSK/LPT on how to potentially get a full refund within 7 years if a California buyerHi r/RobotVacuum,

I bought a Samsung R7070 vacuum about 4 years ago. The battery has nearly run it's full life, however a replacement is not available from any retailer I can find. Their authorized parts distributor does not list the part and has not responded to queries about it. Samsung support couldn't help either, though they claim that I could send it in to get repaired for $199 (despite the fact that this was advertised as a user-replaceable part).

First a warning:

I posted the following review on the Samsung website:

>I purchased this in December 2017. running time is now about 15 minutes in medium mode, well less than the advertised 30 minutes. No replacement batteries are available from any source, including Samsung's official channels. The battery is advertised as a user-replaceable part and they show it as an accessory one can purchase, but it is not sold separately. They want $199 to replace the battery at their service depot. Further, they claim this is a ""fur/hair friendly"" vacuum but the ""blades"" inside the vacuum do nothing to stop hair from building up. The roller needs frequent cleaning and i don't even own a pet. I feel totally defrauded by samsung and will never—ever—buy another samsung product after this experience. ​forget that... Buyer beware!!

**Samsung deleted the review saying it didn't meet their guidelines.** I guess they don't like it when people post critical reviews? So, don't rely on reviews on [Samsung.com](https://Samsung.com) as they are unlikely to accurately reflect the problems with their products.

The YSK/LPT for Californians: ""[Under California’s Lemon Law, manufacturers of most household electronic goods that sell for more than $100 have to provide spare parts for up to seven years, regardless of warranty status.](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20151211-column.html)"" So, if you buy a Samsung vacuum, or any other product over $100, they have to make spare parts available to you. If they do not have the parts, they must repurchase it from you for the price they paid for it.

I had a Samsung monitor fail and Samsung eventually did purchase it back from me. I will see if this approach works with Samsung on this particular issue.

In the meantime, good luck out there!

Update: I was able to find a replacement part, no thanks to Samsung or their only authorized parts dealer. The part number listed on the Samsung website is wrong, and the real part was replaced with a new part number."
"Shark IQ replacement unitWe had an unfortunate Shark poop incident today.  Instead of trying to clean it, I’m tossing the unit.  We’ve only had it since Xmas and use it daily.  Was our first robot vacuum and had few complaints in the short time it was around! 

2x questions 

#1 - we have the below Shark IQ with self emptying base.  Can I buy another of just the exact shark unit to dock with this base (presumably saving money and not having to rebuy the whole thing)?

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S864GPW/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glt_fabc_G7KYNNENCYQKYZK551PM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

#2 - should we upgrade?  We have a 2 story & split level home (4 different levels total) so I was never relying on the Shark’s mapping and just manually moving it to various levels (outside of the main one it was on) and letting it do it’s thing without a solid map.  

But because of this sub I’ve read about the DeeBot OZMO T8.  Our home is mainly hardwood with tile kitchen, though not sure we need it mopped constantly.  And we have a number of floor rugs/carpets through.  Is the Multi Level mapping successful?  Is the mopping easily toggled off?  

It appears that specific unit would require a separate emptying base purchase, so it would be pretty pricy.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!"
"Bought Shark ai Robot Vacmop - a bit disappointedThe main thing I am disappointed about is the mapping and detection. It could be 1-5 feet away from the homebase dock and not be able to find it when I press the DOCK button. It will go all the way around the house before it docks. I've had it for a day and have tried to dock 4 times and it's only made it back one time without help.  It seems very random and relies very heavily on the sensor rather than the memory of what it mapped. And even with that it is very random in how it chooses it's path. Does any have the same experience and maybe a remedy for it?  Or should I return it for something in the same price range that is actually ""smart"" lol."
"Dreame vs Deebot - trustworthiness/reliability?Hi! I'm deciding between the Dreame z10 pro and Deebot N8 pro plus.

I've poured over the specs and (early) reviews and am still not sure which is the best value. I'm willing to pay double for the N8 pro if it's of much higher quality, but I'd love some insight on either company/product:

* Reliability over time - once that 1 year warranty has expired, how long can I expect the product to last?
* Customer support - how easily I be able to get help if I run into problems?
* Warranty coverage (in Canada) - if something breaks, is it going to cost me $300 to ship it back for a ""free"" replacement?

*Open to other suggestions.. I have all hardwood floors. My top feature priorities are stellar object detection (needs to avoid charging cables, cat vomit, etc), mopping, and auto empty bin.*"
"carpet deep cleaning tests inconsistent?I'm trying to choose a robovac for a mostly carpeted apartment, and I was looking at videos on youtube comparing carpet cleaning results. And I was surprised how vastly different the rankings were on the same type of test (deep carpet cleaning)!

For example, in [this video](https://youtu.be/lRZLcft2PBc?t=81) roombas totally dominate everything else with giant margins, but [here](https://youtu.be/WtScRB2yaYg?t=105) roombas are in the middle.

What do you think explains the inconsistency and what have you found to be the most trustworthy sources of experimental data?"
"Magnetized Boundry Tape For Lefant M213I bought a roll of magnetized tape to block off a doorway. The vacuum just rolls right over it.

Is there a tape that anyone knows actually works for this robot? I don't want to keep spending money on stuff that doesn't work.

This is the tape I bought. Unfortunately, yesterday wasthe last day to return it. I didn't get to test it until today because of work and my mother being hospitalized.

Is the fancy roborock honestly worth it?
"Why it is not recommended to put the dock under something?Honestly I don't want a robot vac sitting at the centre of my living room and I don't want to see it all the time.

Thinking about keeping it under the bed. But the user manual says you should not put it under a furniture etc. Why is that? Is it causing some problem? What happens if I put the dock under the bed?"
"Roborock S6 Pure vs S6 MaxV?Hey Reddit,

I've been thinking of getting a robot vacuum, but the amount of options is overwhelming. After finally settling on Roborock, I now need to choose a modell. The S6 Pure and S6 MaxV seem to be good options.

It would need to clean about 100 square meters of space, deal with my long hair and be pet friendly, since I have two dogs. Because of the later fact, I'm leaning closer towards the MaxV, because of the object avoidence feature, but is a lot more expensive (And, quite honestly, more than I want to spend on a vacuum, that still requires manuell help).

Mopping isn't a priority at all. I've heard it's not the best feature in those vacuums anyway.


Do you have any experience with either vacuums especially in relation to pets?

Edit: Bought the cheaper S6 Pure an couldn't be happier. This thing is amazing! The vacuum cleaner and dog get along as well :)"
"Looking for recommendations in USASo I bought a Eufy q32 pro on clearance, and I love this thing, it's my first robotic vacuum, that said, it's bullying my recliner relentlessly and keeps getting stuck under it. I don't really need one that mops, but I have a lot of carpet and I shed relentlessly (with hair that's about 3-4ft long) While not necessarily on a budget, I don't see myself needing the Roborock S7 MaxV. I was kinda looking at the Q5+ or the Roomba J7+ but honestly I'm very new to the robot vacuum scene, so I thought I'd come ask people that are far more knowledgeable than I am :)"
"Companion for Roomba 960I have a 960 which is 4 years old, it does still a great job.
Now I would like to buy a second one for the second floor of the house
I would like to stick with iRobot (maybe i3, there is no lots of obstacle to run around, just beds and so on), or take another one?
I like the fact to have everything inside the same app to be honest, but if there is something cheaper which does the same job, then is ok."
"Roborock S7 Plus, but which one?I've been meaning to get the Roborock S7 Plus for some time. However, where I live, it currently seems to be almost exclusively available in white which has made me second-guess because I'm worried that with such a light color, it will end up constantly looking dirty. Otoh, I've seen a video in which a black S7 had a lot of what appeared to be scratches or smears on the sides, which was looking just gnarly, so I'm wondering if maybe white is the superior color after all.

&#x200B;

Researching further, I found that the S7 MaxV Plus could be a good alternative (which would also be more easily available in black), especially because it's supposed to be better at recognizing obstacles, but I'm not sure if this is worth the higher price.

&#x200B;

I was thinking that if I'm getting the S7 MaxV, I could just as well go all-in and get the S7 MaxV Ultra as, honestly, I can see myself not wanting to use the mop function a lot due to not wanting to deal with the cloth after each run. But at that point, it really has to be worth it because the price is way higher than what I originally wanted to spend, and there seem to be some drawbacks.

I've seen a video in which a guy was pointing out that you'll regularly need to clean the station which seems a lot nastier and time-consuming than changing the cloth. 

I only have two smaller rooms that need regular mopping, so I assume that I'll only need to change the cloth after each run, and not mid-run.

Do I assume correctly that the Ultra station also dries the cloth? So that the vac can sit in the station with the cloth on for a couple of days after a mopping run? Or would I also need to remove the cloth after each run?

Having to use dust bags is a drawback as well, but I think I can deal with that better than with with a mop-cleaning function that, in the worst case, gives me more work than a station without.

"Best Mid-Range option?Hi all,

Wanting to get my first robovac, and feeling pretty confused, so I have a few questions I was hoping you could help with:

1. Is it worth spending more? Will a £1000 guy really do that much better than the £500 guy?


2. Is it worth getting a self empty station?


3. What is the best mid-range?
Amazon has a few self empty options that seem decent, but I honestly have no clue:

Laresar L6 Pro


Dreame D10 plus

For context: Multi-level home, mostly carpets, no pets (though my wife seems to shed enough to cover that)

Thank you!"
"Buying my very first robot vacuum and I need some help!Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some real help from some real people. 

TL;DR (I’m putting this here for those who don’t want to read the entire long post): I’m trying to choose a robot vacuum from Amazon, it must be able to pick up human hair and dog fur from tile floors. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so I have never owned a robot vacuum before but I have wanted one for a long, long time. Now that Amazon is having a sale and I have about $300 in amazon credit, this seems like the best time to get one. Only problem is there are so many options and I have been sitting here reading reviews for hours and I can’t decide because of course the reviews are all conflicting and confusing. I think I’ve narrowed it down to two but I am open to any other suggestions if there’s something you think is better (I do have some wiggle room on the price, as I’d like one that will work and also last). So here’s what I’m looking at now:

1. Roomba i4 + EVO ($400 with prime deal & comes with a free 3rd gen echo dot / listed price $667.98)
2. Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL ($400 / list price $600)

I live in a 2 bdrm/2bath apartment, approximately 1000sq ft. I’m a single parent with a teenager and a fluffy little yorkie mix. We all shed. Between the 3 of us, we shed a lot! There is always hair and fur everywhere. I hate vacuuming and you know the teen won’t do it so I think it would be nice to have one of these around to help me out a bit. We are quite messy, which is also part of why I put off buying one of these for so long but I’m hoping that having this will motivate us to pick up our shoes/clothes/etc off the floor. I’m tired of living in an apartment full of clutter and hair/fur. Would be great to be able to walk around barefoot in my house. I have a bona for washing the floors but it doesn’t work as well when there’s hair everywhere! Oh almost forgot to add, our apartment is all tile, no carpet or rugs.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is that it can handle picking up all the hair and fur without clogging up or anything. Ill be honest, I am not at all familiar with the Shark brand. I’ve wanted a Roomba forever but I think it’s just because it’s the one I’ve heard the most about. But I’m not going to make a choice based on name recognition alone. For all I know, the Shark is just as good or even better than the Roomba. One thing that makes me lean more towards the Shark is that it’s bagless and the Roomba bags are costly. On Amazon, I found a package of 3 replacement bags for $20 and another package with all the other replacement parts for $55. I could not find the Shark replacement filters on Amazon or even by googling it so idk the cost of those; all I found were off brand replacement parts that claim to fit but have mixed reviews on whether they actually do. Also, I’m not sure if it’s safe to use off brand replacement parts. But im clueless about this so if people who know more about it tell me it’s fine then I’m fine with it. I just worry if something goes wrong with a bad part then it will break the vacuum. Regardless, I won’t need to buy bags for the Shark so I assume it will cost less as far as replacements go. Other than that, both of these seem pretty good.

Of course, both have pros and cons. Also, both have an average of 4.3 stars on Amazon. I really just can’t read any more reviews or my head will explode. I don’t know if I can trust random websites who get a percent of every sale; I feel like this just incentives them to try to sell you on a more expensive product rather than what’s really best for you. And I honesty can’t tell what is going on with amazon reviews. I saw several reviews that made no sense. Someone actually wrote “I love it, but it leaves behind clumps of hair” (and many others are very similar to this, with 5 stars but a lot of negative stuff in the actual review). I don’t understand it… why do you love it if it isn’t doing its job? What do you love about it? Are you even a real person? Did someone pay you to put 5 stars but they don’t care what you actually write in the body of the review? I feel like either I’m going crazy or the world is or possibly both. 

So yeah, I need help. I hope there are people here who can help me. I really appreciate any and all information, suggestions, etc. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. You are true heroes!"
"Shark AI Ultra wit Lidar has terrible object avoidanceIt keeps trying to climb these stool pedestals and gets stuck. Honestly not sure how it can’t see them with LIDAR because the pedestals are fairly large. 

On top of that, the app is terrible and creating rooms is buggy.

Definitely do not recommend this robot."
"RoboGem ArleneDoes anyone have an honest review on this brand and model? I'm struggling to find video reviews on this specific vacuum. One has been ordered for me as a gift and I'd like some more insight on common issues to look out for. We have 4 cats and 2 ferrets so the main thing is - will it pick up their fluff?

UPDATE JAN 2023: 
Hey guys, update on RoboGem Arlene who we've affectionately renamed Meryl Sweep. I got Meryl in October last year and I cannot stress how much this thing has changed my life. It runs with no issues using the Tuya smart home app. Seriously zero regrets on this machine. Pet hair, dust and other dander is a thing of the past. Great suction on the vac setting and the mopping function is really good even on hardwood floors because you can set how much water you want to use. Obviously it won't do well on heavily soiled floors but your everyday quick mop is taken care of. The only minor problem I have is that I accidentally broke one of the little clips that clips on the vac container, but other than that it still works perfectly."
"Proscenic M7 Pro reviewThis sub was super handy while I was diving deep into the rabbit hole of robot vacuum research, so I thought I would share a review of the one I bought since I couldn't find many that didn't seem like a paid review. The M7 has been discontinued as the M8 has just come out; I picked it up for about 220€ on sale a few months ago.

I'm overall very pleased with my purchase. It's reduced my regular vacuuming significantly and has made such a big difference in the amount of dog hair floating around my apartment. It does need a bit of supervision but it's very manageable. Details below!

Pros:

* Mapping. It's my first robot vac with this function so I may be easily impressed, but I'm thrilled with it. It made a map of my whole apartment, and I can set up zones and tell it to clean one place or room at a time. It doesn't go where I tell it not to go. It's luxury!
* It climbs over small obstacles. This was important to me because I have furniture with bench legs that are about 1-1.5 cm high and round, and it climbs over them easily.
* 2700 Pa of suction on powerful mode. From what I understand, this is bit higher than average at this price point, which is why I picked it because I have a big dog with short, stiff hair and a few flat-weave synthetic rugs. It's AMAZING at pulling up the dog hair on both the hardwood AND the rugs. I've been pleased and surprised by this. It's also pretty good at getting into corners and such.
* Option to buy a self-emptying station for about 100€ extra. Another reason I picked it thinking I might add it on later, but honestly the dust bin is so easy to take out and clean I probably won't bother.
* Gets itself unstuck very well. I almost never have to intervene when it's cleaning, I just put it on and don't think about it, which is also luxury. When there is an issue it will tell you exactly what is wrong (it talks to you, which I think is hilarious).
* It mops surprisingly well, and you can add a bit of floor cleaner to the tank. I wasn't expecting anything from the mopping when I bought it, but it's actually good, and easy to clean the mop cloth. It came with some disposable pads but I've yet to figure out how to use them haha.
* The build feels pretty solid, all the attachments are easy to put on and take off without flipping the vacuum over like I had to do with my old, dumb robot vac. It's also really easy to remove the main brush/rubber flap thing for cleaning.

Cons:

* It's pretty loud. Nowhere near my regular vacuum but still quite loud. The suction is loud, and it navigates by laser and with a front bumper so it's also loud bumping into walls and such as it goes.
* It climbs rather aggressively, which is great for the bench legs on my couch but it will sometimes try to climb the transition into my kitchen which is at least 3cm and it gets itself stuck halfway up. I have a table with bench legs about 2cm high and it also climbs but gets stuck. And it's super loud trying to get itself unstuck until it gives up and pings you to come fix it. It's loud when it's climbing even successfully, actually.
* It only has one mopping function and you can't set up zones and tell it to mop only one room like you can with vacuuming.
* The water tank for mopping is pretty small; it takes about 1.5 tanks for my 60m2 apartment.
* You can only set up a max of 5 restricted zones.
* Maybe 5% of the time it gets a little lost i.e. can't find it's way home, or gets confused by obstacles that are too close together and can't get around them even if there is enough room.
* The app is not terribly intuitive, and it can be a bit buggy, especially when setting up zones. If you're a Luddite, don't buy this vac, but if you're reading this on reddit you probably aren't."
No wifi robotDoes anyone know of a robot vacuum maybe a mop one to that doesn't use Wi-Fi. I've always wanted a robot vacuum but my partners worried about selling data. I'm really not but I get it. I have a really fluffy cute kitty so hopefully one that's good with pet hair would be nice but. Honestly at this point I just want to see my cat ride it.
"Shark AI mopvac feedback?Just ordered a shark mopvac (RV2001WDCA). Reviews online are critical so I'm on the fence.

Anyone own this model?"
"Suggestions for a robo vac that can traverse floor transitions?I live in a 1900 sq foot apartment, our flooring is laminate wood and tile, we have some cheap bobsweep vacuum that cant actually get over the faux wood strips that are in the door jamb which serve as transitions between the different flooring types. Any suggestions on a robovac with better ""climbing"" abilities? transition strips are probably 1/2"" tall and 1"" at the widest. 

To be honest, not sure what other features to really look for, just a simple but dependable vac that can roam around the house, no pets or children if that helps, budget of 500-600 CAD would be ideal."
"Self emptying recommendations?I'm looking for a good, cheap (under $300, preferably) that has good enough avoidance, I'm trying to have it suck up socks or yank power cords with it's wheels. I've given up so thoroughly on my shark VACMOP ion whatever that stupid name is that it's going to become a new tannnerite target, so I'm avoiding shark products all together. I don't care about the robustness of of any apps, honestly the simpler the better, the only things I'm looking for are the two things mentioned above."
"UK options? also worth buying one used?Hey folks so finally caving and grabbing a robot vacuum to help out around the downstairs. All hard floors, living, kitchen and dining room. Kitchen is a dark grey. 2 adults, dog and chinchillas. So any suggestions? Trying to keep it under £200 really unless spending more is going to be a God send. Looked on vacuum wars and whilst solid a lot of recommendations that are hard find honestly in the UK it seems and budget picks are still £600 at times. Then anyone had luck buying one on Facebook, ebay, etc? Or are they too damage prone so just go new? Then are the mopping ones worth it? 

Currently looking at the Eufy 15C Max for £164 seems most promising? Looked at the roborock s5 max and I can get one used for £200 is it worth it? Looks in good condition and all the stats on the app are 95% or higher. Equally not sure if it's worth that as there's no warranty. 

So open to suggestions really, if I need to spend more then so be it. Thanks folks."
"For all hardwood floors and ease of use, X1 Omni vs Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra?Hey everyone, I've done a fair amount of research so far on both of these vacuums and the general consensus I get is:

Omni:

- Better for mopping(and less work since it dries the mopping pads for you unlike the roborock?)

- Not as nice for homes with carpet(not relevant to me)

- App/support is much worse than Roborock

Is this fairly accurate and do you believe I'd be happy with either models? 

The Omni having a worse app does sound concerning, but honestly, how bad is it?
Is it truly terrible like some people have stated or is it just a bit worse/less polished than Roborocks? 
Does it still have most of the same features?


The fact that the Omni can dry the mopping pads for you seems to be a major advantage there that isn't talked about too much from what I've read.


I can pick up an Omni today at Bestbuy but would have to wait weeks for the Roborock to get here, so that's another minor bonus"
"Unhappy with j7+I recently picked up a j7+ on sale up here in Canada for $799 which is a pretty decent price. I previously had a Neato D5 and with a toddler running around and 2 cats I was hoping for something that would require less preparation for running, and I liked the auto empty feature. 

I’ve been pretty disappointed honestly. It seems to navigate significantly worse than my old Neato. Not so much in its actual ability to cover the floor but more that it looks so unsure of itself the entire time and takes longer to do it. Especially around the perimeter and chair legs. It also bumps into things more than I expected it would. I also haven’t been impressed to see it leaves quite a few crumbs around in the kitchen. 

Another point of frustration is the obstacle avoidance completely ignores toddler toys. I knew it didn’t have a database for toys and such but I didn’t expect it to just push them around as if they are not there. I also haven’t yet had the obstacle review section work. It always just says “this is where it would appear”. 

I’ve been thinking about returning the j7+ for the roborock S7, but the S7 would be by itself (no auto empty bin). Or the Dreame Z10 Pro since it’s a really big value here at $150 cheaper than both the other options. 

95% of my house is hard flooring. What do you think? Should I go for the S7 without the auto empty?"
"Help me decide what to buy.Hi, hope everything is going well. With the Black Friday deals I can't decide what Robot vacuum cleaner I should buy. Being honest has been reading and watching videos but I am unsure which one is better. I am not going to expend hundreds of dollars in one vacuum but being the first one I want to get a budget one. These are my pics:

360 s5 Lidar robot vacuum with mapping technology 2200 . $169 Amazon.

Wyze Robot vacuum with Lidar technology 2100 PA  $219 Amazon

 Dreametech D9 Robot vaccuum with Lidar technology and mopping function 3000PA. $239 Amazon


Also has been looking at Eufy and Corey but their budget ones doesn't have Lidar. 

Does anyone have experience with one of this? What do you think about my pics?. 

Thanks in advance!"
Shark aiWhen my shark ai is done cleaning it pops up with the map. But when I click on it it says map unavailable? Is there a way to fix it
"Cheap robot vacuum for small apartmentHello,
I am looking at all the options and getting lost, could you advise some models that would do the job? Apartment is 50 sqm, hardwood floors or tiles only without rugs. Also has few edges at the doors about 1- 1.5cm high.
I was looking at Xiaomi Mi Essential Mop and Neatsvor X500, but to be honest have no clue if they would suffice.
Any reccomendations would be appreciated.

P.s. my budget is up to 200-250 euros"
"Dreame Z10 Pro Robot Vacuum and Mop with DockHave you been spending hours and hours reviewing the same robot vacuums over and over to see which one you would like to spend your hard earned money on? Have you still not come to a conclusion yet? Well, I’ll come to that conclusion so you don’t have to!
Enough of the rhetoric, I cannot repeat this enough, but this wonderful machine has changed my life and in this review you’ll see how it can change yours too.

Firstly, I have to note that I have been sent this robot vacuum by Dreame, although I have been told that I can be honest in my review, as they care about the customer feedback and want to make the best possible products on the market.
Furthermore, I am going to write a small bit about me so you can understand the struggles I have with hoovering. I am 21, partially blind, I have psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Aspergers. I have been looking for months upon months, to try and find the best robot vacuum for the price. I cannot see small crumbs an dog hair on the floor so I get incredibly frustrated when it comes to hoovering up because I often miss a lot of debris on the floor and my mum, who works full-time, takes it upon herself to help me do it, and as much as I love my mother, I don’t want to rely on her in that way and I don’t want to take up anymore of her precious time. This is where the good bit comes, I have been eyeballing Dreame’s products for a while and luckily for me, they sent one out to me to show the world that if you struggle like me, this is the perfect robot vacuum for you, whether you have disabilities or just want that added comfort of not having to do the hoovering in your house, because this robot can do it all! 

Upon receiving this product, I noticed that the materials used and the packaging provided was incredibly well put together. I took out the beast-of-a-hoover and right then and there I knew I was going to enjoy hoovering for once. All that you need to do, when taking the hoover out of the box is put in the little spinning brush, it click in with ease and trust me if I can do it, then you can too. 
The product I received came with the docking station, and my oh my it is a wonderful contraption at that, I’ll come back to that a little later. After the small assembly, all I had to do was plug in the dock, ‘press the return to dock’ button on the hoover itself and off it went and rolled up the dock and started charging itself!

I will be honest, I’m currently in a homeless hostel waiting to get my own place, so I am unable to talk about the Wi-Fi connectivity and the app in thorough detail. However, I had a little look and it seems very easy and simple to navigate, with zones you can set for the hoover to avoid, and detailed maps that you can label, so in future you could probably say ‘Alexa hoover kitchen’ lets say and it’ll go and do it for you. There is other benefits of the app I’m sure, but like me, you don’t even have to use the app, all I do right now is press the power button, take the dog for a walk and I return to a lovely, freshly hoovered flat. This is all done through the Xiaomi Home app, which if you don’t know, is an extremely useful app for other devices, such as Xiaomi scooters and other utilities that use the same app. If I’m not mistaken, you can also have up to 3 floor plans on the app as well, so you can take it upstairs and allow it to hoover, its not heavy at all either so don’t worry about pulling your lower back out. 



This bot is one of very few that used LIDAR as well as vSLAM, which in basic terms means that it uses both cameras and sensors, as well as lasers to gather insightful information such as detailed mapping of a room, as well as which obstacles to avoid. It is honestly a sight to behold, especially when you see it avoid something such as the dog  or a dog toy, and it does this all in real-time, it’ll have the maps taken beforehand as a template, but it’ll detect objects on the fly, and this is what makes this product so magnificent. This pinpoint-precision tech tells the hoover where to hoover and what lines to take in order to most efficiently and effectively vacuum. The suction is powerful, it cleans my carpets perfectly and gets those little crumbs, dirt that I can’t see, and even flakes of skin that shed due to my psoriasis too! Effectively the Dreame z10 pro has changed my life for the better.

One important thing to know,  is that this hoover is pretty good with dog hair, I have a Shiba Inu, which sheds a whole lot, and the hoover manages hair quite well, although after a month, you do have to detangle those stray hairs, but Dreame has thought of this and has provided a little detangling/brush tool underneath the back lid of the hoover itself. Furthermore, this little hoover gets into spots that some people with mobility problems will struggle to get into, such as under beds, sofas and tables, getting into those awkward spots so you don’t have to, saving your back in the mean time!

Now, onto the meat and potatoes of this product and why it stands out. The dock. Each bag lasts 60 days, I was given 2, though I think I read somewhere that you get 5, the bags will be available on amazon, and so far I’ve nearly reached 2 months and I still have room to spare, I usually hoover every day. Enough about the bags, onto the dock itself and believe me, you’ll want to purchase this hoover with the dock, it just makes sense! When the hoover has detected that its compartment is full, it goes and empties itself into the dock and then comes back and finishes where it left off, with no guidance or input needed at all and it just looks astounding, almost like a piece of art. If, you don’t buy the hoover with the dock, you’ll have to empty the hoover into a bin yourself and that’s quite arduous and finicky if you ask me, I don’t even know how you’ll charge the hoover without the dock. The obstacle avoidance is really good, it avoids dog toys and even wires, though sometimes it can go over smaller wires, but I’ve never seen wires wrap around the brush roller, so i believe there is a sensor next to the roller itself that detects wires and stops before it sucks them in.

Lastly, the mop is very good, I have a small kitchen and it does the job noticeably well. However, you have to keep taking the mop off and on as and when you want to mop, and in my case, if you’re using the reusable mop, you have to clean it every time, because it is that effective at mopping that it just gets full with dirt after one use. One improvement that could be made, is an automatic lifting device for the mop, so you don’t have to take it off when hoovering over carpets, it detects a carpet and a little motor lifts the whole mop up so your carpet doesn’t get wet, I’ve seen it implemented elsewhere, but paying nearly twice the price for a little lifting device for the mop isn’t worth it. One other small gripe I’d say, is that maybe Dreame could make a bag-less version in the future, so you can just empty the bin and not have to fuss around replacing bags every 2 months, and I would hope that these bags are bio-degradable. However, I’m being very nit-picky and it was very hard to find downfalls in this device, as it is very useful and life-changing for me especially. 

In conclusion, I believe that right now, for the money, this is the best hoover on the market, with the features you get. Even at full price this is a steal, but right now there is a limited early-bird price so definitely check around to see that price. If you’re someone with disabilities or limited mobility then you will greatly benefit from having the Z10, even if you have no disabilities and just want the added ease of coming back from work after a hard day, going on the app and telling your hoover to clean, you’ll come back to a nice hoovered home, which in turn means less stress for you, and to me, that is priceless. I am so thankful that Dreame has bestowed upon me this magnificent product and I hope that many of you enjoy it as much as I have, and that my review helps guide you into knowing which robot vacuum to buy, it is definitely worth it. This is a step into the future, that of autonomy and I’m happy to be a part of it. Dreame is a very forward thinking company and wants to help make peoples lives better as well as easier and I personally look forward to what they have to offer in the future, and you should too, so keep an eye out! I also love how Dreame values the customer, they listen to feedback and want to make the best products based on what the customer wants, and that is so valuable to me and all companies should be like that, I’m very thankful to Dreame for giving me this opportunity, and I hope that my review is appreciated.

"Looking To Upgrade To A Self-Empty Robot.Looking to upgrade 


So I'm looking to upgrade from my current vacuum helper bot to one with Self-Empty. Preferably with side brushes as my kitten ADORES the current robot. As soon as he hears it activate, he comes running to hunt it and its side brushes.

The reason I want to upgrade is not just convenience (I mean who doesn't want Self-Empty?) but also because my current robot is having issues holding a charge. It will run good for a while and then just die suddenly. It's a knock off with no brand name anywhere and it speaks in broken english but, its surprisingly good at its job and surprised me with what it could pick up. Honestly I love my robot and even gave it googly-eyes.

Anyway, I'm looking for a good and reliable Self-Empty robot. Preferably with side brushes and preferably under 700$. Mop attachment/function not necessary, even though my current one has it. Alot of the ones I looked at had mixed reviews. Any recommendations?

Edit: I forgot to mention that I live in an apartment with 1 bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a small bathroom.

This is what I currently have and it was, surprisingly, very good at its job until recently. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KSWNP4P/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_Q3X0GQYEDC21J205RAV3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
"Recommendations for CatsHello I’m looking for a vacuum that is good with cat hair. Preferably one with LiDAR and one where I can set up no go zones. I have three cats who shed often. Two of them are long haired. In the house we mostly have Berber carpet and tile in the kitchen/dining room. With medium pile carpets in two of the bedrooms. 

I would mostly be using this device to pick up kitty litter and fur for a maintenance clean in between deep cleanings with my vacuum every Sunday. I honestly don’t want to spend more than 500 unless it is necessary for a better clean. If you guys could recommend one it’ll be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!"
"Looking for advice on first robo vacuumHi guys,

I have been doing a lot of research lately and read some posts on here as well and, to be perfectly honest, I have not really gotten anywhere which narrowing down my decision.

Here would be my requirement:

* I have a dog, short haired, but still bit of a shedder, so this probably would be the biggest priority
* I have pretty much no carpets, most of my home is marble and laminate flooring
* I have multiple floors where I would like to use it
* Features I definitely want: mapping with no-go zones and room cleaning

I have seen that pretty much a big chunk of the better models nowadays have the mopping function, how well does this actually work in practice? I have also seen that there are some models that have multi-floor planning. Does this work well in practice? Or is it more recommendable to buy, lets say, two slightly cheaper models and have them each in charge of their floor?

Based on what I am looking for, what would be some  recommendable models? I seem to have found lots of good things on the Roborocks and feel like a few of their models could fill my needs pretty well."
"Shark vacmop IQ won't clean both lights just blinkHow's my title says I'm needing some assistance here I have a shark vac mop with IQ navigation I'm not exactly sure of the making model but anyways I already tried looking through there user manual and looked up all the troubleshooting error codes and not a single one mentioned anything about both the lights just blinking white.
I was wondering what anyone else would be able to suggest here because honestly I'm sick of having to send robots back to shark for warranty since this is the third one I would have to have sent back I'd be looking at $75 already just spent on paying their shipping fees for defective robots... I paid it for the first one for my regular vacuuming robot in that replacement still going strong then I've replaced this back mop twice already in the third one is still defective.

Please someone help me save my robot"
"My Experience with the Shark IQ and Roborock S4Just wanted to share this as, had I read a similar post two months ago, it would have saved me a lot of time, effort, and gas in my car.

Like many people, I defaulted to Vacuum Wars on youtube when picking my first robot vacuum, which of course led to the Shark IQ with self empty base. I initially bought an ""open box"" version on ebay which was defective, so I won't judge based on that one, but my second try I bought one new from Kohls because of their frequent coupons. 

I knew going in to it that the mapping wasn't the greatest, but all the official documentation and supposedly reputable Vacuum Wars said that it would take around ten runs, which is tedious but not unreasonable. I also followed all the advice of turning on all the lights, putting it in low power, cleaning up ahead of time, and letting it run until it docked on its own each time.

I cannot understate how awful this thing is at mapping. It damaged my furniture, spent 90% of its time in the same 10% of my living room, only found its way back to the dock about half the time, and the map in the app looked wildly different each time. I figured this was temporary until it mapped, but after nearly 20 runs in ideal conditions, it was stuck at 7%. Resetting and trying again will not help. 

From what I can tell, getting a robot that is physically able to complete a map is like finding a holographic charizard. Even on Vacuum Wars he had to get a replacement for his review unit, which he glazed over thinking it was a one off, and even then I don't think he ever got a full map.

Essentially, a random navigation bot would have been better.

After realizing the importance of good mapping, I returned the Shark and got a Roborock S4. I have loop pile carpet and laminate with low thresholds so I figured it would be an excellent fit. 

Let me tell you, it 100% is a better fit. This robot is amazing. It takes literally a couple of seconds to accurately map a room, and you can pause and add the no go lines and zones in the middle of the run. It also cleaned more thoroughly than the shark, picking up enough to fill the dustbin in a single run when the Shark had gone over it only a day previous. It rarely bumps in to things, and when it does, its very lightly (not damaging my furniture any longer). 

Honestly I don't know whether that Vacuum Wars review is a scam or just very poorly researched. His other reviews have been good, but there is no way someone could use this bot and honestly believe it is the best robot vac on the market. A LIDAR bot with a self empty base is a pipe dream for me now, but literally no one should be purchasing a Shark IQ robot."
"Advice? 1 floor, ~1500sqft, mostly vinyl w/ area rugsHi all. I’m looking for my first robo vacuum. Every time I think I’ve decided what would be best I found a counter point, so I figured I’d just try asking. 

-Main goal is to reduce cat hair and clean up litter that gets kicked out of litter boxes. I have 3 cats and I’m hoping this can reduce their mess footprint a bit. I also have a girlfriend with long hair who honestly might shed more than the cats. 

-The vacuum will be used on one floor, run during the day while I’m at work, either every day or every other day. The layout, particularly for the living room, is a bit wonky with some weird angles for the walls and a decent amount of furniture. 

-Vast majority of the floor is vinyl plank with some low-pile area rugs. Mopping is not important to me

-This won’t be the only cleaning for my house, I still intend to vacuum on the weekends (unless it’s THAT good). More of just something to help keep up during the week

-Self-emptying would be nice but not super important

-Budget ideally under $500. I do have a Costco membership 

I’ve considered the Shark IQ RV1000S (though I then saw many said don’t trust vacuum wars rec for this), the roborock S4, the Roomba i3+, a standard i7, and a few others. Any advice would be super helpful. Thanks!"
"Deebot Ozmo T8+ Quick ReviewHonestly, I bought it expecting the issues others were having. I got mine from bestbuy for $450

It mapped my entire two story home without an issue, and was able to be brought up and down stairs and find it's location without a problem.

Battery life on Max+ is only about 70min but I think that's on par or better than other brands. 

Cleaned all the stuff on my tile without slinging it, and the carpet (upstairs) had a bin full of dirt when I had vacuumed 3 days prior which makes me think it works well.

Long term reliability is unknown, haven't tried mopping but I barely have tile so it's not a huge concern. 

Much quieter than expected but still a bit loud if you're trying to watch TV.

Lidar works great and navigated every room with ease."
"Mijia 1C vs Dreame F9? need urgent helpHi

I have bought the Mijia 1C. It will be delivered this next Monday, I still don't have it on my hands. 

After further investigation I have found that there is a robot that is almost the same, but it has much better battery life (5200mah rathenmr than the 2400 on 1C) and smarter maps / app.

I feel so sad that only now I have discovered that the Dreame F9 has room partition, room cleaning, scheduled room cleaning, etc. I mean, it has much better features than the 1C, but exactly with the same chassis / hardware. :(

My questions are the following :

1) Shall i send back the Mijia 1C (I will not even accept it to be delivered this Monday) and buy the Dreame F9 ?? 



2) Since the hardware it's the same, do you think that sooner than later xiaomi will update the firmware / app for the 1C to get room partitions too? do you know if there is any upcoming firmware update that will put both robots at the same smart map level? 



3) Do you think there will be any substancial differences in reliability / hardware malfunction between these two? both are manufactured by roborock and both are xiaomi brand.. btt don't know, since dreame is a much less known sub-brand. 

All the help and guidance is appreciated.
please tell me your upmost honest opinions on this. I need to make a decision till this next Monday.

Thank you all in advance. I'm really needing real professional advise. ."
"Looking for recommendations for parents (mid budget)Hi, 
First off, I have been a lurker on this for some time, very happy to have something to post.

I am looking for a mid budget robot vaccum for my parents. They live in a flat (approx 2000 sq ft) and have no carpets.

I have a roomba 7 series and one of the things I miss is the ability to clean only one room. I know the virtual wall add on thingy but honestly we are usually too lazy to use it.  I was hoping that I could get one for my parents which can clean individual rooms as directed. Does this feature work well in today's robo vacs? Any other recommendations of things I should be looking for as features? Also any recommendations would be great."
"Consumer Reports Jan 2018 ratings on robotic vacuums in Samsungs site. Link. And my thoughts on our 9350.We got a 9350 model. Refurb from Amazon with extended warranty. Jurys still out though with frequent CO2 error code yet nothing found in LH drive wheel. May get punted back to the seller within the 90 day thingy here pretty quick. Honestly. To me. This technology is like plastic surgery and they haven't quite worked all the bugs out of all of em to sell em n make people happy consistently. It may be just the fact I have a refurb as well. Other than that this thing vacuums as good as or better than a good stand up model. Thats a Hoover 2 pc set from Sears 10 years old. Big problems getting the mapping set as well. Seems to get hung up in places at times. About 50% of the time.
Ehh. We'll see. Hopefully this link helps people decide. I chose the higher end which was lower on the scale but does have good suction power. CR also considers cost as a ratings adjuster.
