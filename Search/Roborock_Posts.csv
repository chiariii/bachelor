"SO many models. So confused.Finally getting around to replacing our 5-year-old generic robovac. Mostly hardwoods here, but a few area rugs and a carpeted basement we vacuum... once in awhile.

Everyone says roborock is the best, but I get overwhelmed looking at all the different models. Roborock's ""help me choose""and model comparison features aren't leaving me feeling any more confident.

What I really want is a high-end vacuum with a bagless dock and no mop. Does this exist?

I want the high-end features like high suction, room mapping, zone cleaning, self-emptying (no bag!) And the reason I *don't* want a mop is because I don't trust the hands off systems to not make a horrible mess at the dock and I also don't want to do the regular maintenance that comes with the less-advanced ones that you fill yourself. Easy enough for me to just bust out the swiffer and do a room as needed.

I know I could buy a high-end one with a mop and just not use it, but that feels like wasting money on a feature I don't want.

Roborock doesn't have any bagless docks, right? Should I go with Shark instead? Looks like their app is a dumpster fire, though.

Can you make a recommendation? Where do I belong in the robovac world?"
Why would anyone have it on “Smart” or “light” instead of “Max”? It’ll just get your crumbs and dust easier..For ultra dock! Not robot vacuuming.

"Buying from untrusted soucesHello,

I see a good deal for Roborock vacuums once in a while in FB and eBay. The thing that bothers me the most is, original owner reporting it lost and Roborock blacklisting my device bricking it. 

I'm aware of other issues like warranty and durability but what are your thoughts on the blacklisting aspect of buying from an untrusted source? Any other dangers you see. 

I have heard similar stories with friends who bought phones from eBay and I wanted to see if this is a possibility with robovacuums"

"Roborock S7 max v questionSo I have three cats, two rabbits, and a big 80 pound dog. So toys get knocked around and things get knocked from the counter to the floor.

I currently have an iRobot S9+ with the Mop. I’ve had it for a year and my biggest problem has been the object detection. It has none. So I was going to bring those devices upstairs and get the S7 Max v ultra.

My question is how does it handle with object recognition? Is it really good about avoiding things like small plush toys, cables and clothes? 

Or is it it something where I should wait for the S8?"
"Roborock S7 MaxV human/pet hair pickup performance?I’m currently deciding between the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra and the Roomba J7+. I really like the mopping and self clean ability of the Roborock, but every video I’ve seen has shown poor performance of hair pickup from carpet. The Roomba doesn’t have a good mopping kit, and the navigation is not as good as roborock’s, but the hair performance seems miles better on carpet.

I know of that several S7 owners have replaced the rubber roller brush with the Q5 brush, and that seemed to improve the carpet hair pickup performance. I was wondering if this would be comparable to the Roomba carpet performance after the Q5 brush change. Does anyone have insight into this?

Primarily concerned with my own hair (long) and two ragdolls cats who will be coming early next year. Ragdoll hair seems particularly long compared to the average cat. If I had no carpet I would definitely get the Roborock but as of now, I’m leaning towards the Roomba based on the carpet hair performance.

My apartment is around 900 sqft with 50/50 carpet and hardwood."
"S7 MaxV Ultra: Map reset itself and then drained 8% of it's battery trying to reposition itself. Now it can't move because the wheels are suspended...on flat ground.I'm suddenly having problems with my S7 MaxV so I think I'm going to return it while it's still in the return window. Robot tech is not quite where I want it to be yet. Maybe the S8 will have better software, but honestly it probably won't be fully autonomous / headache free for a couple more years."
"Do you think a roborock will handle rabbit mess (hay, wee, droppings)? Which model would you recommend.I've cross posted this question to a couple of subs, so apologies if you have seen it before. This is a very expensive decision and I'd really like some advice on it.

After shopping around and reading reviews, Roborock seems like a brand I can trust. I'm a bit wary of the hundreds of brands out there, which could be manufactured very cheaply, or using bad copycat tech.

Now for my question:

Me and my partner adopted two house rabbits. We have tried our damn best to litter train them, but there is still wee on the hardwood livingroom floor, and vinyl kitchen floor every day. Luckily they do not wee on the small section of carpet near the stairs, but they poop there lots.

It takes at least an hour every day to mop up, sweep/hoover up the poops, and brush up all of the hay that spreads around the house.

I was lead to believe that they would be litter trained, and the mess wouldn't be so bad, but we are really struggling to cope with it. (But don't worry, they are loved and well looked after, its just that we are loosing the little free time/energy we have after work on nothing but cleaning).

I understand that automation will not fully solve this. We will still need to manually empty their litter trays, manually sweep/mop up their rabbit run (a sectioned off area that they are free to go in and out of, that they do the worst of their mess in), and sweep up any particularly bad areas as we find them.

But it will help with my peace of mind knowing that the floors are regularly mopped, as currently the rabbits stand in their wee and spread it through the house. And if it can get the little bits of hay (not the big collection that congregates in their run), that will also help and make this task less arduous for us.

We have decided to not get each other Christmas presents this year so we can get a robot hoover/mop instead, but as it's such a big/expensive decision, and I'm still not convinced it will cope with the mess, we haven't bought it yet.

**Our budget is about £600** ($731), but if it absolutely needs to be higher than this for it to be any use, we might be able to afford this if we have to.

I particularly like the sound of self emptying/cleaning, because there is so much mess that I think it will need to be done multiple times a day, which may just become another task I procrastinate, making the whole thing useless. This isn't a hard requirement though.

I think navigation shouldn't be too difficult for this robot. The vinyl kitchen floor is just a square, and the hard wood floor living room has lots of obstacles, but nothing I think a robot couldn't handle. 

The main thing is robustness and cleaning power, as the hay and poops will be more mess than an average hoover is used too. 

I think the S7 max pro is out of our budget (unless someone can convince me it's absolutely worth it).

But do you think any other models could cope with my needs? Which one would you recommend?

Do you think what I'm asking for is too much, and a robot vacuum is a waste of money for me?

(Btw, for those that dont know, rabbit poops are just hard and not soft/wet, and mostly hay)

Thank you if you have read this far!"
S5 Max not cleaning where it’s supposed to
"Replacement battery for S5maxI have a 2 year old S5max that I run daily.  It used to be able to clean my main floor on one charge, but recently it’s had to recharge about 3/4 of the way through.  I’m thinking I need a new battery.  I’ve looked at Ali Express and Amazon and I’m nervous about buying an off brand battery.  

Can members recommend a trusted source for a battery.

Are there some tips to boost battery life?  Today I disassembled my bot and vacuumed out the hidden areas, I changed out all my consumable parts and I’ve redrawn my room sequencing.  I do replace consumables more frequently than suggested.

Thanks for your help!  Love my S5max, it’s a real workhorse!"
"Adding Roborock (via Mii Home or Roborock App) to Smart Home AppsHas anyone had any luck integrating their Roborock device to their smart home hubs or Apps. I do everything right, but Google Home and Alexa can't seem to control the Roborock at all. And the Alexa store reviews are not great.

Has anyone had better luck, or have an explanation for the issue? Is it just not good app design or the platforms don't trust the app enough to give it full functionality?"
"Looking for Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra (220 V version)Hello

Does 220 v version of Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra even exist? I only find 110 v version.

If it does exist, is there a trusted website that provides it and ships worldwide?

I found it on Aliexpress, but I can't really trust them."
"S7 available in Europe?I was wondering if the S7 is available to purchase in Europe? I tried Amazon UK and Amazon Germany but unfortunately, neither will deliver it to Ireland. The official Roborock site won't deliver outside the US. 

I Googled but the sites selling seem dodgy and all have poor reviews on Trust Pilot."
"wwyd?Our s6 maxv went to it's grave. We have no robot vacuum and a 16 month old that eats floor crumbs. I'm desperate to buy the s7 maxv ultra w the badass docking station, but I'd prefer to buy everything off Amazon (best customer service IMHO). 

Should I just buy the vacuum itself, since it's available individually on Amazon, and trust that the docking ultra station will be coming soon?

Do you think it'll come to a break even cost, or are they going to screw customers a bit and make it $100+- worse for buying the station separately?"
"Comparing my roomba i7+ to my S4 MAX.When comparing my i7+ and my s4 max, I find the i7 just constantly slams into shit full speed. The s4 isn’t great in that regard, but it at least slows down before it hits something. I just sat and watched my i7 plow full speed into the same couch leg 4 times in a row. 

Also, the mapping doesn’t seem particularly great? The i7 has somehow missed my ENTIRE FUCKING KITCHEN. After multiple mapping runs. 

What the fuck. 

I expected the i7 to be an upgrade but so far it’s actually been performing worse than my s4. It loves to just aimlessly spin, takes 2x as often to complete a run, and has already accumulated a ton of scratches from hitting stuff.

The cleaning base has been absolutely amazing so far though. 

The app is so-so. It doesn’t seem to have the stupid limitations on number of no-go zones and stuff that Roborock has, but it also doesn’t give you any of the customization that the Roborock gives you. Your only option seems to be whether you want 1 pass or 2 passes - can’t choose power level or anything like that. 

Honestly if I had paid full price for it I’d be returning it. It sure as fuck isn’t worth the $700+ it’s listed for from my current experience with it."
"Changed from Ecovacs OZMO 950 to Roborock S5Max. What I wish I knew review.Hi,

TLDR: I had an Ecovacs Ozmo 950, worked great for 2 months then had constant anti drop sensor errors. Had service, was worse when it got back. Returned it, bought a Roborock S5 Max a few months later. It has it's flaws, mostly with the app. I would have been happy with either, RR just need to fix the sequencing.

There are things I wish I had known before buying the Roborock (RR). I looked at plenty of reviews and many people saying that they bought an S7 but wish they had stayed with their S5 Max. I was also looking at an Ecovacs T8 AIVI, but the problems with my first Ecovacs (EV) made me want to change, especially after a service that seemingly did nothing.

**Vacuum Performance**: *Winner Ecovacs*. I don't know if it because of the two side brushes vs one on the RR, but in my situation the Ecovacs did better for cleaning my low pile carpet. I have been getting a lot of main brush errors on the RR but it does seem it was because I didn't have carpet boost on. Regardless, I didn't have it on with the EV and it still cleaned better.

**Mopping Performance**: *Winner Ecovacs*. You can't beat a steam mop, the EV left a wet line behind it but it didn't actually clean any marks. Same with RR. I have to give this to the EV because it detects carpet and doesn't go over it, only around it. With the RR I have had to set No Mop Zones all over the map. The RR is much easier to detach the mopping pad.

**App Mapping**: *Winner Roborock*. I have many low windows and have the same problem that it sees out the windows and gives an off looking map. RR didn't split the rooms well (most of the house was one colour), the EV app did that perfectly, but the accuracy was better with the RR. Roborock wins because I mapped once and it was perfect. I needed 6 attempts to get a good one with EV and then if I had to manually move it to clean, it would reset, occasionally the map would turn and it would lose the dock. The RR got lost last night and lost the dock on the map. I put it back on the dock and it retained and returned the original map and knew where it was. I had a corruption in the RR map, I restored it in the map and it was back to normal, no remapping required. RR wins this easily.

**App Splitting and Merging**: *Winner Roborock* (and it isn't even close). I tried splitting and merging with the EV app and it is so bad, so unsuccessful, it should never have been released. Thankfully I could undo before messing up my map again. Depending on your room (like if there are two entrances) you need some different thinking to split rooms with the RR app, but it works perfectly. So easy to do.

**App Scheduling / Sequencing**: *Winner Ecovacs*. The EV was easier to create custom schedules and select the room sequence. It was ordered in the order I pressed on the room. RR requires you to edit the map and select the sequencing, but this is for the whole map. If I want to schedule to do just three rooms, you have to use the overall sequence for that. If i have seven rooms but don't sequence the last 4, it just does them after. RR need to fix this so that when I select rooms in my schedule, it is done in the order of selection. An overall sequence only makes sense if always doing a full clean, which is likely only when mapping initially.

**Navigation**: *Winner Roborock*. I would constantly see the EV bumping into straight walls. It would go along a bit turn in, bump reverse, go ahead more, turn in bump etc, all the way along. The RR hugs the skirting board with rarely a bump against the wall. The EV also gets hung up badly trying to do around chair and bed legs and wastes a lot of time. I saw my EV once spend 40 minutes navigating around a mat when mopping. It detects and won't mop over it, but it won't do straight lines around it either.

**Overall**: So, I would have to say that the extra cost for the RR was worth it so far. For me and the troubles I had with the EV mapping, the app is very important to work well. I wasted so many hours having to remap the house multiple times. RR need to fix sequencing for schedules. I have a schedule that starts at 4am, i want the rooms furthest from the dock and bedrooms done first. It needs to be done in the map editing, but should be in the schedule which makes more sense. I only had my EV for 3-4 months and it is still early on for the RR. I accept that there is a teething period and so far I am happy with the RR. I think I would have been happy with the EV but I just couldn't trust it or their support after a bad experience before."
Places to buy S7 plus & dock in UK?
"Recommended location to buy Roborock S7 from the UK?I'm in the UK and I really want to buy the Roborock S7 robot vacuum. My go to place is [Amazon.co.uk](https://Amazon.co.uk) but it is not sold on there. The only website I can find it from is [https://www.myrobotcenter.co.uk/](https://www.myrobotcenter.co.uk/) but the reviews about this company on Trust Pilot seem extremely suspicious, seems like they might be fake reviews from the company to drown out the real ones that are very very negative.

Any reputable website or store to purchase this from in the UK?"

"Roborock vacuums ARE NOT Xiaomi productsI've seen many people saying ""Xiaomi S5"" or ""Xiaomi Roborock S5"". That's wrong.  Xiaomi is not Roborock. Xioami is not the boss of Roborock. Let me explain...

A brief history of Roborock: Roborock founded in July 2014 by CHANG Jing. Company purpose was to create home automation products but they initially focused on vacuum and robot vacuum products. In September 2014, Roborock received a investment from Xiaomi and became an enterprise member of the Xiaomi ecological chain (other members at the time was Huami and Yunmi). The largest shareholders of Roborock are:

1. CHANG Jing, who is the founder and CEO of Roborock.
2. Shunwei Ventures III (Hong Kong) Limited, controlled by XU DALAI, who is the director of Xiaomi.
3. Tianjin Jinmi Investment, controlled by LEI Jun, who is the founder and CEO of Xiaomi.

The share of the later 2 shareholders (Xiaomi) are 24.7%. So that means Xiaomi owns almost the 1/4 of the company.

At 2016, Roborock, released its first product, a robot vacuum. In order to make the product trustful and popular they released the product under Xiaomi label (which at this time, it was very strong). ""Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum"" became very popular and the star product of the Mi Mall. In the Mi fan’s festival in 2018, the sales volume of Mi Robot ranked second most selling product.

In 2017, just like other companies in Xiaomi’s ecological chain, Roborock publishes its own brand. ""Roborock"" for the rock brand and ""Xiaowa"" for the cheaper products. Dividing product lines in two brands is common tactic in Xiaomi family (ie Xiaomi/Redmi).

So, at September 2017 by removing Xiaomi label the company introduced the second generation of the robot vacuum ""Roborock Robotic Vacuum S5"" or ""Roborock S5"" (code S50 for white, S55 for black). Because they used again Xiaomi sales channels, websites promoted the product as ""Xiaomi Roborock S5"" so people will connect it as the successor of the successful Mi Robot model. For more than two years Xiaomi and Roborock goes together so people realize what Roborock is (=the company behind the device).

In 2019 released new models we all know S4, S6 and S5 Max. At this point we see the Xiaomi reference to be removed by major sites like Gearbest, Banggood etc. Local eshops list Roborock as separate product removing products from Xiaomi line. Removing the Xiaomi’s label means the Roborock could build its own brand influence and gain more independence on the profit attribution.

We are grateful for Xiaomi investment on Roborock so we can all have those great products, but we must stop saying ""Xiaomi"" on Roborock products.

Note: There is a new robot vacuum under the Xiaomi label, called ""Xiaomi Mi Vacuum Mop P"" or ""Xiaomi Mi (or Mijia) Robot 2-in-1"" model STYJ02YM . Don't confuse, this is not manufactured by Roborock. The specific device is exactly the same as the Viomi V2 Pro vacuum manufactured by Viomi (Viomi is subsidiary of Xiaomi). This specific model has completely different technology than Roborock. It has a 2-in-1 dust and water tank (electronically controlled as S5 Max) as well as different mop algorithms. It looks like that Xiaomi wanted to keep Roborock brand independent but they also wanted a newer model for their own brand. So they get Viomi best selling model, changed the color of plastics and created a new model for their product line.

Update: I forgot to add that Roborock functioned as [ODM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_design_manufacturer) and updated for Xiaomi the original Xiaomi Mi Robot into a new model called ""Xiaomi Mi Robot 1S"". Its the same as the original one (no mopping) but it has some upgrades (like better cpu, power from 1800pa to 2000pa, new optical sensor and some software changes)."
"Roborock Used/Like New vs Renewedhey guys

what do you think of roborock from amazon Use/Line New are they reliable to buy?

I don't get why renewed are more expensive than Used/Line New

**Used - Like New**: An apparently untouched item in perfect condition. Original protective wrapping may be missing, but the original packaging is intact and pristine. There are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging. Instructions are included. Item is suitable for presenting as a gift.

**Amazon Renewed** is your trusted destination for pre-owned, refurbished and open-box products.

see this example the difference can be like 40$

any input would be great

"When to replace filter? (S5)I was gonna ask if I was doing anything wrong that was causing the filter to get clogged, but I did a quick search and it appears from comments that the filters aren't actually clogged when the vacuum says it is.  If we can't trust the machine, then how do you know if you need to replace the filter?

Does using a filter when the machine says it's ""clogged"" do any damage?  I mean, I don't want to burn out the motor..."

"S8 + dock reliable?

"Reliable website to buy front wheel replacement for S7 maxVI recently bought a used S7 maxV for $450. I usually never buy used so there was the risk of something not being right. 

This weekend I got it, and out of everything the only thing broken was the front multidirectional wheel broken in half from the bracket(that contains two screws).

Temporary solution is literally putting the wheel in its place and letting gravity keep it there (so far it has only come off once).

Realistically I need to find a website that sells the wheel with a bracket. Unfortunately roborock doesn't sell it on their website.

So I wanted to ask if anyone also had to replace it with the bracket, and where did you buy it from (with link if possible).

-Thank you."
"How reliable is the Software and Mapping?Hey there, i currently own a Ecovacs Robot and whilst being very happy with its cleaning, the Software and Mapping is horrible. Are you happy with Roborocks Software? Im considering buying a new Robot and thats one of the deciding Factors.

Roborock 1st Gen - 2001 hours and 99Km^2 - amazing reliability!
"Roborock S7 can't reliably get out of its basePreviously, my Roborock used to reverse out of its base station. However, I had to reposition the base, and now, while the roborock correctly finds the base station, and charges, it has difficulties getting out of the base station. Specifically, it tries to *turn around* while in the base station, rather than reversing out of the station, and in the process either removes the base station to one side (and I have to fix it), or can't get out of the station for a few minutes, and keeps turning. Any one else see this behavior?"
"Roborock Water Kit with drying module for G10S Pro with US S7 MaxV Ultra small reviewJust got mine assembled and working, couple hours in total including reading manuals and installation of an additional adapter to connect into the existing water inlet for a washing machine. Included accessories set is incredibly handy, and I had to buy additional angle joins and an adapter for the water inlet only because of my setup and robot placement. Everything else (including this fancy grey pipes cover and even a tool to put pipes inside!) is included. In my case an adapter for the drain pipe was also there, it is a small rubber thingy but I didn't use it (just put drain pipe into the same hole the washing machine uses). Provided pipes length is huge, I didn't use even a third of it. Btw, as you can see pipes are different, one for clean water (smaller diameter) and one for drain.

In overall I'm quite surprised by the packaging, accessories set and general product quality, at least for now.

I got it on Taobao for $112 with free delivery to a mail forwarder within China and then sent it to my country by that mail forwarder (but I'm not in the US, so can't recommend a company). As such manuals are in Chinese but Google Translate app does amazing jobs translating Chinese text on pictures or directly from camera.

That grey box on top of the base station is 220V - 110V adapter as I have a 110V \[US\] vacuum version living in a 220V country 🤦‍♂️ . But this also confirms that the drying module which is also included in the kit and is powering the water kit supports 110V input even though it states 220V only on a label on it. The drying module has 20V output by default.

I didn't find any way to control or configure the water kit from the app (the drying module is configurable though). The button on the water kit seems to turn it off and/or manually start it. I didn't get to the point when it starts working automatically yet though, except when it filled internal container with water during the first power up (I've heard sounds).

Also it is intended to be used with cleaning solution available in China - a much cheaper blue 1L bottle containing 1:200 concentrate (and not 1:300 as the global 480 ml bottle version). But my forwarder forbids to send liquids from China so I just watered down the global version in 2:1 proportion and put into the water kit solution container.

Included video is a little bit long, I've tried to record the water kit working and its sounds but didn't quite reach the goal. At the end you can see some details about my setup though (if anyone interested in it at all).

Also more pics and manuals are at the end, you can use the Google Translate app in a camera mode to translate pictures.

"From UK and unlikely to get S7 MaxV available here. Are European vendors reliable, do the products come locked, or is the S7 sufficient?My partner and I are brand new to all this and looking to get a robovac. We have settled on either the S7 or S7 MaxV, but it seems like the latter won't be available in the UK market.

I can see you can buy online at Media Markt, but will they honour their warranty in another country from others' experience?

Also is the 2500Pa in the S7 sufficient for just a rug and the occasional carpet and therefore not really worth going for the newer option? Or do people expect double the power of the MaxV to make a huge difference? If the S7 does the job well enough we will just get that one and not worry about the faff of an import.

I'm not going to get the docks for either. Just the base models. I'm okay with emptying the trays and cleaning the mop pad myself/buying spares and just washing once a fortnight.

Bit anxious about all the recent troubleshooting S7 owners are posting here about their bots going rogue and getting lost or just spinning in circles doing nothing, is this in response to a new update? Or is this quite a rare occurrence?

Thanks in advance."

"How 'reliable' are Roborock's servers and app?I've had a 360 S6 for a year and a half now, and the responsiveness of the app has been progressively worse over time. Constant time-outs, maps not being found, and therefor not being able to clean.

"Roomba 770 to RoborockHi,
I am finally upgrading from my Roomba 770 I got in 2014. So, I have 3 options, which one do you guys think is a better deal - 

1) Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra from Ebay with 2 year warranty (renewed) for $1035

2) Roborock S8 from Amazon with 3 Year warranty ($75) included (New) for $560

3) Roborock S8+ from Amazon with 3 Year warranty ($99) inculuded for $815

All prices I mentioned at the end include taxes.

Roomba 770 is a old vacuum and I used to manually empty it once a week or when it prompted me to. I don't mind doing this. I don't have pets. I have mix of tiles, hardwood and carpet. So do you think I need S8+ dock?

I am not sure how reliable these are, so I thought I will buy extended warranty. Do you think I need it? If not then my S8 will go down in cost  by 75 and S8+ by 99.

I am new to mopping. Old one never did it. I don't know if S7 max v ultra is better with self emptying or get S8 and change it myself ( don't mind doing it if it is once in a while).

From the spec it looks like S8 suction is better."

The sales person recommended something from Ecovacs as well that was in a similar price range as the z10 pro. But we thought that something in a higher price range would be more reliable.

So, basically I am looking for validation of the purchase. But please tell me if you have any other recommendations as well."

"Want to get a roborock s6 maxv in the UK, preferably the sooner the better. What's a reliable source?Basically title. I want to get a roborock S6 MaxV for my partner as a gift. We live in the UK - preferably I could get it sooner, being a gift and all that. I've found either out of stock sites, one website that sells it mysteriously cheaper with bad reviews and reddit posts claiming they are a scam. I found xiaomiofficial.ee/product on a reddit comment and it seems legit but I can't find almost anything on them, and they're never recommended in other UK threads.

Thanks in advance!"
"Your experience with longevity/reliability of Roborocks?I'm thinking about buying an S6. I've only used cheaper Deebot N79S vacuums, and I've been disappointed in their reliability, needing to RMA a few within 1 year. I even bought a second to use on the second floor of the house and so that I'd have a backup to use if one broke. Even if one breaks, it's not as annoying because of how relatively cheap it was. However, they have broken 2-3 times within 2 years with regular use. My reservation with buying any more expensive robot vacuum is how much better or similar the reliability would be compared to the cheaper vacuums. I'm wondering if a more premium model would have better reliability, or all robot vacuums tend to break within the first 2 years. I haven't been able to find any Consumer Reports type data about robot vacuum reliability differences between brands.

What has your personal experience been with the reliability of Roborock vacuums? Info like: Owned for ____ years, 1) no problems 2) ___ problems within 1 year (under warranty) or 3) ___ problems after ___ years would be very helpful. Thank you!"

"Waterpump reliability? - sensitive hardwood floorsSo I am deciding which vacuum to get my parents. The biggest issue might be their super expensive hardwood floor that is apparently too sensitive for wet mopping and can't get a single drop of water that is not dried out immediately. 

If I understand correctly, the only Roborock models that allow you to choose in which rooms to mop, are the S5 Max and S6 Max (?)
Considering, this is correct, my concern is the reliability of the waterpump. If I set it not to mop certain parts of the home (the hardwood floor areas), can I be sure, it won't by some sort of navigation error mop there or won't drip water after it has mopped in rooms with tiles?"
"S7: Scheduled cleaning with multiple floors?Normally when I have my S7 clean multiple floors, I tell it in the app which map it should use.

If I do this, do I need to go into the app and tell it its new floor? Or is it smart enough when it wakes up for the scheduled cleaning to figure out where it is?"

"S7 MaxV issuesHello everyone, I recently purchased a S7 MaxV. It's the most incredible robot vacuum I've seen, but I've been having one issue with it. It doesn't seem to want to go past a certain point in the house (see the red box in the image below). This house has a full blown hardwired Unifi networking setup with multiple access points, but the vacuum does not roam to any of them. When I manually remote control it, I can go to the area in the red box with remote viewing, but right at the end of the map it will drop the wifi connection. There is an access point 5 feet from that red box, but it REFUSES to connect to it. The access points are not meshed, the network is 2.4GHz with no ""fast roaming"" or anything enabled, and it is the same SSID and everything. I tried contacting support, but they were not very helpful. Anyone have any suggestions?

EDIT:

It was the location of the dock, for anyone that has this issue in the future, put the dock in the middle(ish) of the house and it should work fine.

"How well does S7 MaxV Ultra autoempty work for pet hair?A year or so ago, we purchased the Ecovacs T8 AIVI because it supposedly had obstacle avoidance and auto-emptying bin.  We didn't much need the obstacle avoidance, but found that it didn't really work well.

However, the bigger bummer has been the auto-empty bin.  We have 2 dogs, and the vacuum will invariably be unable to empty the bin after vacuuming unless we run it very frequently (2x a day at least), or else make it clean smaller sections of the home before returning to the base.  Managing this cleaning routine (do this room, then empty, then this room, etc) is not easily done via the software, which is part of why that solution is not really a good one for the T8 AIVI.

So, for those with dogs or other animals that shed: do you find the auto-empty is reliable for pet hair?

The other big gripe we have with our T8 AIVI is that it frequently fails to climb some of the thresholds in our older home (fails maybe 80% of the time on some, enough that we just don't have it vacuum certain rooms).  It's hard to find information re: maximum climb height for most robovacs, but if anyone has any insight here as it'd be much appreciated.  For context, the T8 AIVI is supposed to be able to climb thresholds up to 2cm, but routinely fails on our ~1.5cm thresholds; curious to know either the purported spec for the S7 Max V Ultra, or else to hear from anyone who has first hand experience of its threshold climbing ability."

"Both S5’s not running scheduleHi all. I have 2 S5’s both on the latest firmware. I’ve notice that neither are running their daily schedules anymore. I have a very reliable mesh network in my home and this problem only started a few days back. I’m still able to see both on my app and start a clean via the app. 

Is this a firmware bug?"
"S7 MaxV Ultra getting worse by the dayWas really loving our S7 MaxV Ultra (our second top end Roborock in two years) - but recent weeks seem to be a cascade of formerly reliably routines falling apart. 

I have another post about map problems that seem detached from reality. 

Today I’m starting with a clean slate map-wise for that third time in recent weeks across two firmware updates. The issue today is it keeps getting stuck where rugs sit six or so inches from walls or other solid objects. These are heavy wool area rugs with rounded edges, so the rugs aren’t bunching up or curling.

The rug placements are the same as ever and it’s handled them perfectly for months. Today while doing a map cleaning it relentlessly gets its butt hung where the rug ends while plowing headlong into a wall, hearth, etc. If it wobbles out after making grinding noises for minutes, it will turn and plow headfirst right back into the same situation and start grinding again. 

Have loved these units and spent thousands on them in two years, but in recent weeks it’s baffling that previously reliably routines are falling apart with no change to parameters or the physical environment. All I can wonder about are firmware updates. 

I’m keeping it well maintained and cleaned, so I don’t think it’s sensors."
"S7 MaxV Ultra Does Not Auto Empty Dustbin After Vacuum Task - When is auto-emptying supposed to occur?Technical question for the true Roborock nerds out there.  Google can't seem to find any similar issues (search results dominated by unsuccessful auto-empty attempts - my problem is with INITIATING auto-empty)

Recently replaced an S6 with an S7 MaxV Ultra (with the Empty Wash Fill Dock).  So far, it's mostly been working great and meeting our expectations.  The mopping was only a ""nice to have"" feature (but I am rapidly growing to appreciate it more).  The key is not having to manually empty the tiny dustbin 4-6 times per session.  We have lots of hairy pets, and in the past if we didn't really stay on top of things during a cleaning, the vacuum bin intake would jam with hair, and we might find half the house never actually got vacuumed (due to the hair clog) because we got distracted by something and forgot to constantly check the dustbin levels.  First-world problem, but surprisingly annoying after a while.

The routines and tasks are a major component of what makes the S7 MaxV great, but I've been noticing that the vacuum does not always auto-empty the dustbin in between vacuuming tasks.

Some background on my setup:

I have my house mapped and broken into rooms specifically sized to be well within the capacity of the vacuum dustbin.  In other words, small enough that the dustbin should never jam under normal circumstances.  I'd rather have the vacuum return for auto-empty more often than reduce cleaning efficiency or (worse) jam something in the docking station because it tried to suck out too much at once.

I have daily routines built within the app.  Some involve separate vacuum and mopping tasks, others a string of vacuum-only tasks.  For today, I had a routine scheduled that looks something like this:  
Task 1: Room A, Turbo Vacuum

Task 2: Room B, Turbo Vacuum

Task 3: Room C, Turbo Vacuum

Today I watched the vacuum return to the docking station between tasks, charge for a few seconds, then start the next task.  I was under the impression that the vacuum should auto-empty the dust bin between vacuuming tasks, but this doesn't seem to be happening.  I know that the auto-docking is successful between tasks.  I know the auto-empty works because it I can hear it happening occasionally (at least once per routine - need to pay closer attention to determine if it is ONLY at the end of each routine).

Other days I have routines similar to this:

Task A: Room A, Turbo Vacuum

Task B: Room A, Intense/Deep Mop

Task C: Room B, Turbo Vacuum

Task D: Room B, Intense/Deep Mob

On these days I'll notice the vacuum return to the dock after a vacuum task, dock for a few seconds, then start the following mop task by leaving the dock, turning around, and backing in for the mop clean before mopping.  All without emptying the dust bin after the vacuum task.

Today I called Roborock customer support to ask if the dustbin auto-empty is supposed to automatically occur when the vacuum returns to the dock after a vacuum TASK, or if that only happens at the end of a ROUTINE that included a vacuuming task.  The gentlemen I spoke to said he wasn't sure and took my email - hopefully the development team will get back to me.

If auto-emptying is supposed to occur at the end of every vacuum task (even if it's the 3rd task in a 6-task routine), then there is a problem with either my vacuum, the app, or both.

If auto-empty is only supposed to occur at the end of every routine, then that is an unfortunate limit on using the vacuum to its fullest potential.

The great thing about auto-empty after vacuum TASKS are that they are sequential.  I can have many strung together in a routine, emptying after each room, secure in the knowledge that the vacuum isn't driving around with a clogged dustbin intake and only pretending to clean.  If a task is interrupted to clean a sensor or remove a jam (even if it takes 30 minutes for me to notice), the routine just keep going until all tasks are finished or the battery reaches 20%.

If auto-empty only occurs after a ROUTINE ends, that is more problematic.  It means I have to have more routines with fewer tasks to ensure the bin is emptied more often.  The issue is that routines have to be scheduled, and if a routine is still running when the next one is supposed to start, then that next routine gets skipped.  Not the same sequential flexibility as tasks.  The next routine won't just start later if needed (like tasks do).  This is a much less efficient way to schedule the vacuum, since you have to spread the routines out with enough ""buffer"" so that the next one doesn't get skipped if the previous routine runs long for some reason.  I want to concentrate the vacuum cleaning to certain time windows, not have it executing spaced-out routines spread out over most of a day because that's the only reliable way I can get the dustbin auto-emptied between rooms.

Anyone else out there having this problem?  Is there some task creation / routine scheduling element I am missing?  Some known bug with a workaround?

Today I had to manually empty the dustbin after my vacuum struggled through 3 rooms (each a separate task) without an auto-empty - the dustbin was totally clogged with hair and not effectively cleaning when I shook it out over the trash can.  Preventing this is a major part of why I decided to upgrade in the first place."
"Repeated odd map instability after working great for agesWe had an S6 MaxV for 18 months or so with few if any issues. I upgraded to the S7 MaxV Ultra and things started out great for the first month or so. Then one day it just started losing its mind about one particular room and, in closer inspection, it almost appeared as if it’s concept of the relationship between several rooms where they converge had shifted by a couple of feet. Boundaries were bleeding over between previously existing walls and it was trying to go places it couldn’t, etc. 

There had been a firmware update not long prior, so I wondered if that poisoned the well. I wiped out the map and did a new quick map, vacuumed, rebuilt room definitions, etc. Things got back on track. 

A day later some boundaries in those same areas shifted a bit again, but slightly differently and it continued to function, so I left well enough alone. 

Yesterday it started losing its mind again, getting stuck behind a door that has been a no go boundary through the whole new map. I noticed yet more bleed and boundary shifting yet again. Two days running it has done that and gotten trapped with no physical change to the environs, just the map degrading in accuracy. 

Firmware update landed yesterday to the latest, so I applied it. It did got stuck again this morning, so I tinkered with that problem space again and now it’s really losing its mind about the area just inside the door to that room. It wobbled around in two feet of that space and declares it done with 99% of the rest of that room untouched. I can pin and go into that same uncleaned space fine, though… so it can clearly traverse the area. 

Making me nuts. 

I’ve backed up the map and am redoing it yet again from scratch now with the new firmware just in case it helps. 

Had things not worked great for so long before getting unreliable, I’d be unaware of how well things can and should work. 

Anyone else seeing similar? I can share examples from the map, but hoping the description is adequate if others are seeing similar changes in reliability. 

Yes, sensors are clean. No changes of note to the environs. I do keep reconnecting my schedules to the rooms once I’ve remapped, but I assume they don’t carry any baggage and just reference the rooms as defined/redefined."
"Why Don't Schools and Offices Use Robot Vacuums?This may be a controversial topic, but I can see a lot of benefits to use robot vacuums in schools and offices.

It would save a lot of money, because I'd assume that spending $1,000+ on a robot vacuum and Mop combo is still much cheaper than having to pay a janitor for their service every single day. I don't think it would even make janitors go extinct. Janitors have to do some jobs that a robot vacuum just can't.

I can see the argument that robot vacuums wouldn't clean and mop as well as a janitor would, but my argument for that is to have a janitor still work there, but just have them clean less often. For example you could run the robot all five week days, but also have the janitor work for 2 out of the five days, let's say Monday and Thursday for example. I'm sure the floors would still he pretty spotless. 

There are also robot vacuums out there like the Roborock G10s Pro (which I think is identical to the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra) that can have their water intake and drain tanks plumbed directly into the buildings plumbing system which would mean no one would have to fill or empty the water tanks for the mopping system.

Now, I can see the biggest issue being with their reliability. People might think it's a waste of time and that the robots will just break down or have issues. But to that I say, why doesn't someone try it out? Now I'm sure that no business or school would want to waste time and money with this if they think it wouldn't work, but idk. Maybe Roborock could have a partnership with a company or a building to try the idea out, and if it works well then they could advertise and market their robots to business and brands as well!

Anyways I feel like I've talked enough, any thoughts? Am I just being ignorant? I'd like to hear what you guys have to say.

P.s. Also sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm too lazy to go back through this paragraph to fix the grammar"

"Dyad Early Adopter problemsI don't know how popular the Dyad is, but I got what seems like a very early production model. I've used it for relatively light maintenance cleaning over the last few months and it just seems to have a ton of problems.  


1. The screws are uncoated and rusted almost immediately on exposure to tap water. All the exposed screws on the floorhead are severely rusted. Some of them are constantly dripping rust onto the floor and rollers. I've never seen a wet cleaner use bare steel screws, did they fix this and I'm just paying the early adopter fee? 
2. The speaker crackles like a broken Speak-and-Spell about half the time. It doesn't seem to coincide with any particular voice line, it just gets all crunchy and poppy like it's being possessed, which makes me suspect there's water leaking somewhere inside.
3. The floorhead has a bunch of sharp edges that specifically guide and pack dirt into the sprayer nozzles. After just a single use, I have to scrape mud and cat hair out of the nozzles just to get the machine to work normally. If I don't scrub the whole thing by hand - including the ""self cleaning"" rollers - the front roller turns grippy, and pulls the whole thing forward with a surprising amount of force. It goes from being an effortless glide to a wrestling match that leaves streaks all over my floor.

My $10 steam mop is currently a more reliable, easer-to-use tool than this $500 specialty cleaner. If there's something I'm doing wrong, or a design flaw that Roborock fixed since my purchase, I'd really like to know."
"I want to buy a Roborock.. advice please! :)I'm quite overwhelmed with so many versions of Roborock, while I'm doing my investigation, checking reviews, etc.

From what I've read so far, it appears that people are generally happy with the S5 version and it's been most reliable, seems. Do you agree with this?

Or do you recommend me to get an S7 instead? (just seems way more expensive, so I want to be sure the investment is worth it)

&#x200B;

I also want to make sure it has a Dock. Is this something I buy separately, or do I need to make sure that the model I buy includes a Dock? When I was looking at the Roomba, only the ""+"" (plus) versions had it.

What is the difference between Empty Wash Fill Dock, Auto-Empty Dock and Auto-Empty Dock Pure ? Which do you recommend?

&#x200B;

I've also seen that I should ensure it has Lidar for detection.

And I've read as well it's recommended that it supports the Roborock app instead of the Mi Home app. Is this something I should look for as well, when selecting the model?

"Wlan RepeaterHi Community,

when the S7 Max V today moves further away from the Wlan router it should connect to one of the Repeaters but does not do so automaicly. How can i add the repeaters to its Wlan sources?"
"Trigger vacuum with Alexa routine through HomekitI just bought a Roborock vacuum and want to automate it; turn it on when everyone leaves, for example. I really like the integration with Siri Shortcuts, and of course it works with Alexa out of the box. HomeKit, of course, being left out.

All that being said, I prefer to use HomeKit's presence detection triggers because I think they are 1. more reliable, and 2. more flexible - in terms of options to include others in your home.

I know there is a Homebridge plugin to connect HomeKit to Alexa for this purpose, and I did test it. It works well, but it also requires an account on [homebridge.ca](https://homebridge.ca) with comes with a monthly subscription. That's a non-starter for me.

So, the question is - how can I trigger an Alexa routine seamlessly using presence detection in HomeKit. More specific automation example: When everyone leaves, vacuum everywhere.

I have Homekit, Alexa, HOOBS, and Smartthings in my setup but haven't seen a good way to solve this.  

The only idea I have right now, it to figure out how to open a contact sensor (robotically) via HomeKit when everyone leaves, then use that contact sensor as a trigger for the Alexa routine.

You can also tell, I am trying to do this to avoid integrating my Roborock vac into HomeKit using Homebridge also...I'd have to use the Mi Home app app which would result in me losing functionality.

Thanks for any ideas!"
"Dreame V9 vs Roborock S5 MaxMy Xiaomi MOP PRO just got broken, which is somehow a relief since it had so many problems.

I need a proper replacement for vacuum and mopping at single level floor. I have one carpet with long hair, but I don't expect any miracles (I usually set it up as a no go zone and vacumm it manually).

Question is, I could get the Dreame D9 for 300€, Roborock S5MAX and S6 Pure both for 400€.

I've reading reviews of the Dreame D9 and I'm confused (my understanding is that it has been receiving firmware updates in the past year). So I'm wondering if the Roborock vaccums are worth the extra 100€ in my case.

Which one should I get?"

"Roborock S7Hi y'all, I just ordered my S7 for $491.90 and I have some questions. I saw on videos and from other peoples feedback that mapping first time takes really really long, because it has to navigate around the house. A YT video suggests using the navigate feature to make this faster. What is the best way to carry out the mapping. Should I leave things as be or should I move some things up before sending it out to map first time? Basically what is the best/most reliable way to map the S7 so it performs its best?"
"Debating which to buy: S4 Max, S5 Max, S6 Pure, S6 MaxV (with prices)We've had robot vacuums for a few years. First was a ""dumb"" Roomba I got for $80, then upgraded to an Ecovacs Deebot 901 we got for $170 that we loved until it started messing up a couple months ago. Pretty sure it's a wheel sensor or something, but wife wants to upgrade because of reliability issues. 

Now we are biting the bullet to get a good quality vac since we are reliant on it to clean every day vacuuming dog hair. We have mostly engineered hardwood, carpet in two bedrooms we rarely let the robot into (kids rooms with junk all over the floors). Never had a mopping feature before, so not sure if it's worth the extra 100-150. We would only use the mopping to clean up the occasional pawprints tracked into the house in the entrance/living room. Still would use steam mop for deep cleaning. We don't leave our dogs out when we aren't home, so risk of running over poop is low (only happened once :/)

So looking at current prices, I wanted to get recommendations on which to go for if it were you.

* S4 Max - $310 (actually ordered this over the weekend, debating going with a vac/mopping bot instead)
* S5 Max - $460 (Refurb $360)
* S6 Pure - $380 
* S6 MaxV - $460 (Refurb $400)
* S7 - $650 (out of our price range)

Is it worth it to pay extra for occasional mopping? Or is it not worth it unless you get the S7? Also, would getting a refurb but paying for the 3-year warranty make the most sense?"

"Returning S6MaxV (multiple issues)I wanted to like this robot so badly! I did a ton of research to decide what to update my Roomba 690 to. 


reasons for returning:


1.The biggest issue is that the robot detects a electromagnetic field in the MIDDLE of my dining room and as a result refuses to clean there. Support said over email that I should return my unit even though the answer seems simple (turn off magnetic no go line detection with an app toggle). 


2 The side brush is incredibly dumb in execution. When the robot goes on my higher pile carpet the main brush works fine but the side brush always gets tangled. The robot doesn't seem to know to reverse the rotation direction of the side brush to get free like my 4 year old Roomba does...(again...simple software update). 

3.I had to put white pieces of paper tapped to all the cliff sensors just to get my robot to go up on the rug. (another thing that can be turned off with a software toggle). 

4.It relies TOO MUCH on LIDAR without doing false positive checks with the bump sensor. What I mean by this is if it accidentally goes under a drapery or shower curtain then it shuts down and yells at you in the app that it can't see. (again, simple software fix to have it try and go back to the last known position by backing up or driving forward) 


As a software engineer in the medical field this just seems lazy in programming design. Specially for the amount of iterations this company has done to get up to this model. 


I'm going to try out the Ecovac's T8 AIVI and see if that's better. Really sad though given that their unit doesn't have a IR camera.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/15/2020)

I have received my Ecovac T8+ from Bestbuy. Got it set up, fully charged, ran a whole house clean. Here are my initial thoughts in comparison to the Roborock S6MaxV below.


1. It immediately was able to overcome the area with the high electromagnetic frequency. No issues what so ever. It held it's straight line pattern and was done super quickly. 

2. It had the same issue initially as the Roborock where it refused to go up onto my higher pile carpet. I took all the white tapped paper off of my S6MaxV and taped them onto the bottom of the T8. This solved that issue just like the Roborock. I say initially because once I solved the climbing onto the carpet issue it had NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER at cleaning the high pile carpet. Now _note_ this robot has TWO side cleaning brushes and neither got stuck in the 20 minutes I ran it on my high pile carpet, amazing. I still hate having to put tape over an $800 device, but at least it doesn't get tangled once up on the carpet.

3. It cleaned up my apartment in about the same time as the Roborock but did it in a different style. It split the rooms in half and would do half a room, then leave and do another room, then come back. I was worried at first because that seems inefficient, however on completion of the map generation, it merged / separated the rooms correctly and so now I can tell it to clean a specific room. 


4. Carpet detection is amazing! I didn't have to put ANY no go lines in my place vs the Roborock where I had to put some on the carpet as well as by the night stands where cables lay around and the cat bowls. 

5. Avoided the cat bowls. Got up super close but then recognized an object in the way, backed up, and cleaned around them. The Roborock would either not get close to them on some passes or would completely shove them out of the way. (granted the cat bowls are around the area that the Roborock yells about the EMFs). 


6. Seemed to pull much more out of my medium pile carpet. I don't know if that's from the rumors of Roborock's main brush overheating management or just something else. After running it just once there was so much in the dustbin that I had to clean it out by hand because the self cleaning couldn't do it. (This is known issue with self cleaning robots that you need to run them move often to avoid clogs). I JUST ran my S6MaxV last night on that carpet so seems better in that regard. 

------ISSUES SO FAR-----------
-only issues i've had so far in the app was splitting rooms in the app. Merging was SUPER easy but the splitting algorithm seems to want splits along existing walls. For instance I wanted to isolate the area in front of the cat's litter box to a room so I can tell it to clean that area specifically. The first split of the main room was fine but the perpendicular split wouldn't take. I ended up doing an angled single split instead which get 80% of the area I had intended. Will try and get that working better though. From my research this is the biggest issue with Ecovacs. 

-Since I had taped over the cliff sensors to get onto the high pile rug, it caused an issue where the auto empty station wouldn't start up at the end of a clean even though it said it was in the app. Removing the tape covers fixed it. I guess i'll have to come up with a better solution to get it onto the high pile rug but at least i know once it gets on the rug it will be okay. 

All in all I'm much happier with the T8+ so far. It tackled my two main issues ( high pile carpet cleaning and EMF areas) which staying about 99% on par with my S6MaxV. 

I will continue to update this thread throughout the week with further updates since I have until the end of the month to send either unit back for a refund. 







-------EDIT 09/16/2020--------


THINGS I LOVE!
Okay so this was freaking awesome. I remembered reading that the new T8's 3D object detection tech is using two cross shooting IR lights with a center mounted IR sensor.


 I have security cameras in my apartment that turn on when we aren't home since my apartment has a clause in our lease that says maintenance can come in at any time due to emergencies without advanced notice, which they have before . Just helps me keep at ease. Anyway at night they switch to IR mode and I was able to check out the IR from the T8 working in real time! I would also guess that night time might be _easier_ for the robot to navigate/ see in my apartment when the cameras are on because of all the IR light they project out. 


Here is what that looks like in the camera view 
[camera picture](https://imgur.com/a/myiMKrD)
I can't be sure, but it looks to have two side IR lights as well, perpendicular to the front of the robot. The object detection still is better than the S6MaxV. It's getting closer to my cat's water and food bowl to clean but won't run into the like the Max did. The Max always pushed them off the cat mat; maybe because the bowls are too reflective, idk. 


The self empty base station is awesome. A bit loud but only runs for 20 seconds a day and seems powerful enough to clean the filter.I was worried about that since a dirty filter after an empty would just make the robot's suction decrease the next run. 


Navigation has been great! It seems to improve every run and is going under all the chairs my Roborock would get too nervous about going through. 



-----------ISSUES SO FAR-------------
So i've had a few more software issues but again nothing game changing. After removing the cliff sensors so that the robot works with the self empty base station, it again wasn't able to go on my high pile carpet. I picked up the robot and put it on the carpet then told it to run. I then looked at the map and saw it was CREATING A NEW MAP and I couldn't see my old map. Had some slight uneasy feeling that I would need to remap my whole apartment again. I went into the map settings and tried enabling multifloor map saving. THIS WORKED! I immediately found my original map of my whole apartment and loaded that back up. 


For the time being i'm going to place my robot on the area rug and have it create a new map for just the rug until I work out a way to tape or press down the edges of my pile carpet so the vacuum can do the whole apartment in one run. Again, not a deal breaker by any means because it's still able to vacuum the high pile carpet once its on it and doesn't have EMF issues.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/17/2020)


-------The Good----------


I was asked by u/fishy6868 to run some comparison tests on the mopping functionality of both robots. 

firstly here is a picture of both pads and pad velcro plates. [Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/rBuCxpe)


[Second Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/OcVvd13)


You can see from the photos that the Roborock pad is about 10-15% larger than the Ecovac pad. 

I let the T8 mop my whole apartment (besides the carpets) and then compared the results to my S6 tests. I ran both robots on max water level with only one pass in each room. 


Both robots seem to mob about the same which is to say they aren't amazing, but the do a decent job in maintaining your floors for day to day. I personally mop because cat litter likes to stick to the wood floor which has a hard time being picked up by both robot's brushes. Each mop pad was similar in dirtiness when can on different days though I noticed the Roborock, despite a bigger pad, likes to get a lot of the dirt in more of the middle part of the pad. 


Some things I noticed in comparing the pads is difference in methodology between companies. What I mean by this is that the Roborock has a bigger pad but it's much thinner. I think this is because of the tighter tolerance between the mopping pad and the floor when the mopping pad is installed on the Roborock. 


The Ecovac has a MUCH thicker pad but there seems to be more play between the floor and the pad when the pad is installed which seems to be for angular adjustment of the mopping pad as it goes up and down different grades of surfaces. 


All in all I'm satisfied with the mopping capability of the T8 and don't see it as a driving factor in deciding between either robot. If the differences were drastic I might have more trouble deciding but since the difference is negligible then I'm fine with either if given the choice.  


The navigation keeps getting better. I HAVE YET TO PUT A SINGLE NO GO ZONE OR NO MOP ZONE IN MY MAP. It's amazing because with the Roborock I had to put a lot of them (by the nightstands where cables lay, by the cat bowl it never avoided, around the high pile rug that it would always error out on,etc). Simply amazing. It also has gotten smarter about going under my chairs which the Roborock never did because it never was confident enough to.




Haven't had simple map issue since I turned on multi floor mapping. 


-----The bad------


Okay so I took the cliff sensor tape off of all the sensors the other day when I found that they were interfering with the auto empty function from actually working for some reason. After removing these sensors the T8 is able to still get up onto my high pile carpet rug, but it has trouble with navigation once on it (probably from the sensors going on and off about different distances to the floor). I does a lot of side to side motions when trying to go in straight lines (like the guy who posted about his Roborock acting drunk). This doesn't seem to be a deal breaker for me though as much as it was for the Roborock because at least the T8 can clean 100% of my wood floor. The S6 didn't do that because of the EMF issue. Also, the T8 never spits out any errors or stops cleaning which the S6 would do a lot if I put it on that carpet.. 



Maybe down the road i'll figure out how to get it to be more reliable in navigation on the high pile rug. Again though, at least it can get up on the rug and doesn't error out when attempting to clean it. After a few days I am strongly leaning towards keeping the T8 and returning the S6MaxV since i'm not having any major issues.






-------UPDATE 09/19/2020----------

So I've decided that i've done enough testing; I'm returning the Roborock S6MaxV. The T8 is just much better fitting for my needs and has better avoidance. I also hooked it up to Alexa and I can confirm that it allows me to tell it to clean specific rooms or areas with my voice which is something I had wished the Roborock would be able to do. 


I contacted Ecovac support about issues with splitting rooms and they confirmed my theory which is that you can't split a virtually split room. You can only split along walls the LIDAR has confirmed. while that is a bummer, it's not a deal breaker and they said they aim to improve this in the future. I was still able to split 90% of the rooms the way I wanted perfectly. 


Still think that the T8 picks up more hair on carpet than the Roborock. Each day I run it on my medium pile carpeted bedroom and it fills up half the bin where the S6MaxV only filled MAYBE 1/4th. Also when I run my regular standing vacuum after a cleaning run with the T8 I get less in the bin in conparison.  


Navigation still isn't as perfect as the Roborock (it sometimes does little circles but maybe that's it trying to avoid stuff or navigate) but it's 90% cose to the Roborocks so the pros out weight any negatives in that regard. 


I will say though I'm going to miss the active community this sub has. Ecovacs has posts that are weeks old...


Hope this helps anyone trying to decide what's best for their home! Maybe in a few weeks when I get more data i'll add more information if anything changes but day to day everything has been great so seems pointless to still do daily updates. 


Cheers!


P.S It seems VacuumWars on Youtube gave the T8 a top pick over the S6MaxV for premium robot vacuum. Seems for Roborock you're better off going with the S5Max instead for the price to value. I think the S6MaxV is way overpriced at $750 currently."
"S7 vs i7+?Hello everyone!

I want to buy my first robot vacuum cleaner, and after a small research I found that S5 Max was great shot offer/price. But after that I heard about S7, new one and I’m considering grab that one. 

My friends are recommending me Roomba i7+ but I don’t see any reliable comparison or benchmarks of that two together. What do you think, which one I should buy?

Second, additional thing - I saw here that there is already better version on S7 in China with additional sensors on front panel - any rumors when they will be available in Europe? I still want black robot so I need to wait for S7 still, so maybe it’s worth to wait for this one from China to be released in Europe? On the other hand, I’m thinking about robot from Christmas and my patience is going to the end, I just want to have good vacuum robot 😅

Thanks for answers guys!"

"Upgrade from S4 to S5max or S7Been very happy with the S4, but now wanting to try one with a mop. (Don't care about the auto-empty option available with the S7)

I'd be happy (based on all the reviews I've seen/watched) with either the S5max or S7.

But, from what I'm seeing, there's only a $100 price difference, which seems odd to me. I'd love to save that $100, but are the extra features really worth it? (for me).

Would only use it on 1 floor which is 90% hardwood. Any areas with carpet are low-pile. Any expected differences in reliability?"

"S5 Max can't pass door threshold anymoreHi everybody

I bought an S5 Max a few months ago and was very happy. I had to do a little handy work and install ramps on a few of my door thresholds but in the end the robot managed to pass all thresholds clumsily but reliably.

Since this week it can't even do the easy ones anymore. I'm at a loss. Does anybody have an idea what to do? I had a look if the wheels were blocked but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Could it possibly relate to the firmware update from a week or two ago?"
"360 S10 vs Roborock S6 MaxVGreetings All,

Our home pretty much has toys and lego blocks scatter on the floor as we have got young children.

I have been eyeing on the Roborock S6 MaxV since its release last year due to its AI computer vision capability.

I done extensive research on it and it seems that the MaxV not only has blind spots, its computer vision navigation capability isn't that reliable.

The new 360 S10 uses 3 LIDARs. 1 x front mounted long range for general navigation, 1 x front mounted short range to detect objects as small as 1cm, and a side mounted Lidar to reduce blind spots.

Would you go for the S10 or MaxV?

TIA!"

From the product description it wasn't clear if any dust bags are included. I think they will need some bags because it's better to keep the dust trapped and correctly dispose of it.

So, I checked the Roborock lyfestyle Store on AliX since they are one of the main resellers (often linked on the official RR site) but even they dont carry it: [https://gshopper.aliexpress.com/store/group/Accessories/3205065\_518419454.html](https://gshopper.aliexpress.com/store/group/Accessories/3205065_518419454.html)

"Required furniture height for consistent cleaning!?Hello!

I have a Roborock S6 that I adore. Trouble is, it gets stuck consistently under my couch (despite no go zones).

My couch is roughly 4.5 inches off the ground. Anyone know what the minimum required height for reliable, no-getting-stuck, cleaning is? My hypothesis is that it is either too dark for the LiDar to work or I am having a navigation issue."

"Roborock S6 worth it?Dear Community,

I know, you must've heard this question a lot, but please bear with me, since I'm rather new to robot vacuum cleaners.

I currently own a eufy RoboVac 30C and that is also my first robot vacuum cleaner. In general, I like this device a lot: It's powerful enough yet quiet and also cleans everything in my room. Setting up no-go zones through magnetic strips was cumbersome at first, but since I only needed to do it once, it wasn't a big deal. Oh, and I really like the App. But sometimes, it also seems to stop with an error message during cleaning or it gets stuck in between rooms because of the threshold of my doors (something I got fixed with a little ramp).

However, I'm looking for something smarter now, a robot vacuum cleaner that really knows my apartment and one where I can set virtual no-go zones through the App. I also like the thought of being able to let it to clean only certain rooms. I've watched and read a lot of reviews and the Roborock S6 seems to be one of the best for its price.

But before making a final decision, I have a couple of more questions and I was hoping you could help me out:

* How reliable is it for cleaning my apartment while I'm not at home? Like many of you, I'm currently living in quarantine at home, but I have plans to let it vacuum my apartment when I'm not at home, maybe even set up different room schedules for different days.
* How well can it go over thresholds of doors? In other words: How high can the threshold be? I've found conflicting statements in some of the reviews I've watched.
* How good is the Android App? The eufy App really is reliable and works like a charm.
* Does the S6 support 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi networks?
* Is there anything else I need no know?

For what it's worth: I only have hard floors in my apartment and I also have a cat. So the chances are quite high that some of her toys will lie around on the floor. ;) But there are no carpets whatsoever.

Thank you so much in advance, I appreciate your help a lot."
"Help. Which model should I get? (S4, S5, S5max, S6)Looking for an upgrade on my downstairs vacuum - currently a Neato D3.   Nothing is ""wrong"" with the D3, but I just don't like how it handles corners and tight spaces...  I'm considering moving it upstairs where 80% of the floor is carpeted.

Debating the Roborock, based on what seems like overwhelming positive reviews...  Here's my situation.

Downstairs is almost all tile/vinyl flooring.  There are a few half-rounds between the rooms where the flooring material changes - none are taller than 1/2 inch.

There are 2 area rugs... cheap ones from Amazon (this one, to be exact...  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DW94S3A/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DW94S3A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ) and the corners of one rug are covered by couch legs on one side, and entertainment center on another (I've read issues where corners get pushed up, if that matters), while the other rug is in the foyer and taped down.

I'm not too concerned with mopping, although I guess it'd be a plus to stem the gap between ""actual"" mopping.  Also not too concerned with the ""older"" technology of the S5 - I just want something thats going to be reliable, do a good job, and not have be babysat.

So... from those who have had experience with the current model line, what's my best bet?"
"Are there advantages of using the Mi Home app versus Roborock app on iOS?I'm currently using the Roborock app with my S6.  I switched to it from the Mi Home app after I ran into a mapping issue where my entire downstairs was a single zone.  It turns out this likely wasn't an issue with the Mi Home app, but rather just the nature of having an open floor plan.

That said, since I believe the vacuum has to remap everything if I were to switch back to Mi Home, I wanted to see if there were any advantages of having one app over the other.  This may come down to:

 - Updates: how often is each one updated?
 - Features: does one have more features over the other?
 - Reliability: is one more reliable/stable over the other?

I searched around a bit, but didn't find a direct comparison of the apps - so I was hoping someone here may have some experience with both.

If it makes a difference, I will be getting another Roborock (S5 this time) delivered today - so I'll have two vacuums on whichever app I go with.

Thanks in advance for any info."
"Roborock S5 possible battery issue?Been using the S5 since release and discovered my first issue today.

"Roborocks on unusual flooring? S5 Max vs...?New to the world of robotic vacuums - didn't ever go for one previously because they seemed to be so hit and miss for users. Anyway, thanks to Reddit I've started looking into Roborock. Considering the S5 Max. I have a small place (600 sq ft)...don't judge my lack of cleaning skills - ha! Anyway, most of the flooring is polished concrete, I also have a medium pile charcoal grey area rug and dark teal linoleum in the bathroom.

I have read about robotic vacuums as a whole having a problem with dark floors, but I wasn't sure if the types of flooring I'm mentioning might have a problem or if it is only black flooring.

I liked the mopping function on the S5 Max. Any other model I should consider based on user experience with that one? The cheaper the better, but of course I want to buy something good, reliable, and hopefully with longevity.

Edit: It did just occur to me that the Max is overkill on the size of my apartment so I imagine the S5 is really what I should be evaluating others against."

Roborock S7 US availability prediction anyone?Waiting for S7 to be back in stock in US market. I read about the chip shortage impacting the availability.

"What's wrong with this thing??I've had some posts here about being frustrated with my newly bought S6 MaxV, and I got some helpful advice I hoped would solve my problems. 

But it has still only been able to complete a run without getting stuck once in seven attempts, and it gets stuck in the places one would think should be simple enough for an advanced device to get out of. 

What it struggles with mostly is the living room chairs. It fits between the legs from 3 directions, but they are too narrow at the back for the robot to get through. But even with 3 out of 4 directions open for escape, it spends several minutes trying to force itself through the narrowest opening before quitting with an error message.   
Just now it spent 2 minutes headbutting the table leg (!) until I shut it down and repositioned it.

Earlier today it had to return to dock since it only had 20% battery left (the one time it completed its run it did so with 52% remaining), because it had wasted all its energy grinding against the chair legs and even a wall. It managed to get back to the docking station, but never resumed cleaning/mapping when the battery was full.  
Shouldn't it do that?

And it is never able to identify the obstacles it marks on the map and takes pictures of, an IKEA floor lamp was predicted with 86% certainty to be a dust tray, the wheels on the dinner table are with 86% probability poop (wut?), and it never spots the same obstacles even if they are in the exact same location the next run. 

It is brand new, so no dirty sensors or cameras."
"What Happens If I Move The Base For My Roborock S4?My wife and I rearranged the room that contains the base for our Roborock S4, resulting in my moving the base station from one wall of the room to another wall of the same room.  I was concerned that I would have to wipe out the map of the entire house (along with room assignments, etc.) and start over.  I was pleased to discover that the robot is able to update the location of its base station without resetting the map.  (I know the Eufy L70 has to start from scratch when this happens, so it was a nice surprise.)

Here's how I accomplished the move:

1. Set a pin and tell the vacuum to ""go here"" so it was no longer on the base station.
2. Move the base station to the new location.
3. Use the app to tell the vacuum to return to dock.
4. Predictably, it drove back to the old dock location.  It began its little ""wiggle dance"" trying to dock itself, but soon figured out there was no dock there.
5. It drove back and forth and around in circles a bit, trying to find the dock.  (It was kinda cute actually - us humans can anthropomorphize anything.)
6. After a few minutes of looking in the wrong place, it suddenly turned around and drove straight to the new dock location, and docked itself.\*
7. An interesting quirk: on the map on the app, it showed the vacuum driving to the new location, but once it was docked, it showed the vacuum located at the old location.
8. I started a cleaning (a zone cleaning in this case, but I don't think that's relevant) and once it left the dock from the new location, the map in the app updated the dock location to the new location.
9. After the cleaning, the vacuum went directly to the new dock location, and everything appears updated in the map in the app.

\*A note on #6 above - I'm not sure how this would have worked out if I had changed the room that the base was in.  I suspect while the robot was turning in circles looking for the dock in the old location, a sensor picked up a signal (likely optical?) from the base station in the new location, and thus was able to drive itself there.  If the base had been in a different room, or if line of sight to the base were blocked, this may not have sorted itself out so neatly.  I'd love to hear from someone more versed in how this actually functions."
"Wishfull thinkingHi, i recently purchased my first robovac a roborock s7. We are slowly getting to know each other and for know I predict we will get a long and good life together. But you know, there is always these quirks that you learn to live with - but at the bottom of your heart you'd want them to be different, or at least adjustable.

I get we can do a scheduled clean.but I really want to be able to start it from the app. Go over this room 3 times. First two you vacuum, last one deep cleaning."
"Sourcing an s4 from New Zealand?Hi Roborock community - I'm so keen to buy an s4. I don't need the mopping capability of the s5/s6 and I appreciate the lower price point.

So a question for other APAC owners - where can I buy one? Alixpress seems to only have the s5/s6 in stock and Mi retailers in NZ seem to only stock the S5 at a (predictably) inflated price. Amazon currently isn't shipping to NZ.

I'm hesitant to use a US forwarding service because I know the box will be really heavy.

Any tips would be appreciated."

"Roborock S7 Pro Ultra not self-emptying consistently - need adviceHello fellow Reddit users,

I am reaching out to this community with an issue I've been experiencing with my Roborock S7 Pro Ultra. It has always worked flawlessly, but recently, the self-emptying function has become inconsistent. It sometimes empties itself, but more often than not, it just doesn't.

This is particularly frustrating given that the device is less than six months old and I've become quite reliant on its features.

Here's what I've done so far to troubleshoot:

1. I've thoroughly cleaned the filter, ensuring there's no debris or accumulation that could interfere with the functionality.
2. I've replaced the bag, in case the problem was with the bag sensor or something similar.
3. I've checked the docking station and the vacuum itself for any possible obstructions. It all seems clear and unblocked.

Despite these measures, the inconsistency remains.

I've searched online extensively for a solution and have come up short. This is why I am reaching out to you all in hopes that someone might have experienced a similar problem or might have some insights about how to fix this. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance!

Best,"
"Hey, cleaning is noticeably better with latest firmware!I did the latest firmware update to my S7 Max V Ultra last night, and let it mop/vacuum most of the house before I went to bed.

When I looked at the app in the morning and saw the paths it took during the cleaning, I could immediately see it did a better job than it has before!

I know some people on here commented, earlier, that they really didn't see any difference in the cleaning before/after the last firmware update. But this is noticeably better in my situation. (EG. In my master bedroom, it used to make maybe 3 passes back and forth across the room in front of my bed, and only a half-effort to clean around the side of it facing my window. It seemed like it would eventually get the room completely vacuumed but only after 2 or 3 consecutive runs. Last night, it had lots of lines where it clearly went back and forth, getting everything covered.)  And since we just replaced an old ceiling fan in my room, there was some random debris in the carpeting from stuff that fell from the ceiling during the work. I could tell that was all vacuumed up today.

So very pleased with this update!

  
\* EDIT:  Realized objects (such as a laundry basket or pile of sheets) were likely the main reasons it wasn't previously vacuuming the entire room consistently. I don't think those obstacles were in the way of it on this last cleaning run I did. So I may have spoken too soon, OR it turns out this new firmware update simply makes the Roborock negotiate around random obstacles a bit better than before.  
"
Is there a reason why my S6 MaxV is consistently avoiding a certain area?
"Positioning before every new runHad anyone have had the experience of the robot ""positioning itself"" before ever run. My S6 pure will waste about 2 minutes driving through the entire house just to make shure where it is. It does this every time it starts. The software is up to date. Any known fixes to the problem? Would be kind for any advice."
"Required furniture height for consistent cleaning!?Hello!

I have a Roborock S6 that I adore. Trouble is, it gets stuck consistently under my couch (despite no go zones).

My couch is roughly 4.5 inches off the ground. Anyone know what the minimum required height for reliable, no-getting-stuck, cleaning is? My hypothesis is that it is either too dark for the LiDar to work or I am having a navigation issue."
"Maps doesn't load consistentlyI'm pretty upset to be honest. If you are gonna store the maps server side then at least have them work.

Am I the only one having this issues? Maps doesn't load most of the times.

When I go to the maps section it says it can't load them. Even tried 4G to see if it's my network.

We need the option to store this locally. I can't return it anymore since it's many months I bought it"
"Has the S7 MaxV ReactiveAI Obstacle Avoidance improved since it was released?I recently upgraded from the S7 to the S7 MaxV and I was hoping the object detection would avoid [baseboard mounted doorstops](https://sep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-47392605487097/ives-061f-us26d-satin-chrome-4-flexible-door-stop-21.gif), but unfortunately it doesn't. I did notice a setting in the app called ""Pet details"" which apparently makes the S7 MaxV ""move in a way that improves obstacle recognition"" that I may try, but I have a feeling doorstops are just not something the object detection is trained to see.

Since the S7 MaxV was released, has there been updates to the obstacle avoidance?"
"Auto emptying s7 maxv ultraHi all,
I have the s7 maxv ultra and am consistently emptying the dust bin. It’s always very full. The bag, however, is barely full at all (but it does have some garbage within it). I hear the robovac emptying the bin and I also see the bag inflating, but I I’m not sure if it’s taking anything out of the dust bin since it’s always so full.

Is the dust bin where all the garbage that gets picked up goes? Or is it only dust? I tried a small test by emptying the dust bin manually and then putting some small pieces of debris into it to see if it’ll empty… I went on the app and made it empty but when I checked, the debris is still there. What’s going on? 

There’s no cover on the dust bin emptying section (I assume I removed this when I first bought the unit). It’s been 3 months and my bag is probably less than 5% full…?"
"Battery concernI bought my S7 MaxV last month and loving it!! However, not sure if the battery is faulty as the cleaning duration varies.  We have approx 140sq meter area for full cleaning, some days the battery lasts about 145mins and does the cleaning in one go but on some days the battery only lasts for 80-90mins, goes back to charging for about 2hrs and then resumes cleaning again which is a long time finish the full clean. And the unit is always charged to 100% before starting the full clean mode.  I would imagine that the battery run time should be consistent like any other good brand vacuum. I’m following this up with the technical team as there may be a technical fault with the unit and should be either repaired or replaced as it is a brand new unit and under warranty. and I bought this directly from the website and have been asked to send the unit back for checking which I’m really concerned as I’ve to pack it myself and worried if the unit gets damaged on the way. I think there should be better service provided for repair/replacement to have a secure way to send back the unit. I’ve flagged my concerns with the team and hoping to get an outcome that is easier to do and quicker."
"s7 Maxv Ultra just stops in the middle of cleaning and becomes disconnectedHi, I have had this Roborock since June of last year and in the last 2 months, the robot will go out for a scheduled job and just stop cleaning in the middle of it. I will be off at work and the robot will become disconnected/unavailable via the app. No alerts from the app that the robot is stuck or has a low battery. I will come home to find it sitting in the middle of the room, basically asleep. I place it back on the base station and then it is available via the app. This has been happening consistently each day. I have  submitted a ticket with Roborock. 

Anyone experience this? Best ideas to solve it while I wait to hear back from Roborock? I wish there was better logging in the app."
"Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra LDS Error 1, motor was fine // Repaired Successfully.Just sharing an experience I had with my Roborock S7 MaxV.  


I got a whole kit from eBay. It was listed as not working, but for $540. I couldn't pass it up, as it came with the dock (just missing the ramp).  


I had the ramp replaced from buying a heater module which came with a modified ramp to begin with.  
The dock seems fine and no issues there...  


The S7 MaxV itself didn't seem to have issues initially. I tried to make it go to the dock which was a couple ft away. And it would report an Error 1 / LDS issue. The head clearly looked like it was spinning. I do have another brand new MaxV and in comparison it didn't look like it had anything wrong with it.  


I did a 'quick mapping' after trying to get it to go home which consistently gave me errors. But the quick mapping seemed to work... Weird, I had started to use it for a few days doing a new map when i finally brought it from my workbench to the floor it would end up stay at. After a few days, it stopped working and reported that same LDS Error 1.  


Having educating myself with online videos, I decided to remove the LDS and closely inspected it. No hairs, or entanglements whatsoever. Even did some test runs with the 2 large lids removed, and the center head off. Just to see the LDS spin, but again would report an LDS Error 1. I know I got it used on eBay but from the condition I received it, this doesn't looked like it was used more than a few hours or runs before it getting re-sold off online. Probably an Amazon Return, I've noticed others getting DOA's LDS Error 1s here on the forum.  


But I can't return this sucker. So after waiting 3 weeks, I installed an entirely new LDS module that was \~$40. The ""broken"" one that was inside, did look differently. The 2 wires the motor was hard soldered to the PCB, and didn't have a removable plug like the replacement I got. Also theres 2 thin blue wires that seem to go somewhere into the center of the spinning array. These wires were soldered onto the board as well as the replacement one had a connector. The little sticker both named the ""Model"" as the same model #. But its clearly a different revision. Not sure if hard soldered model is a newer or older revision.  


Anyways, I have it working now with the new LDS module. In the end, saved over $800 so its a good deal. I'm just happy I didn't have to replace the Motherboard, which looks like a PITA to get to (requiring nearly full disassembly).  


Hopefully this inspires others you can repair these things.  
FYI, Roborock US Support basically said they couldn't do anything to help, even when I asked I'd be happy to send it in for repair for a fee, or if they could sell me the LDS part. They said to return it to whoever I got it from for a ""replacement"" obviously not an option in my case, well it'd be morally incorrect to pull that on an eBay Seller who specifically marked it exactly as described. So ended buying from another vendor overseas which is why I waited 3 weeks."
"Mopping My Carpet (possibility of?)I just received my S7MVU.  I've vacuumed twice but have not mopped anything yet.  I'd like to send it to the room I've designated as the Living Room (""LR""), which consists of half carpet and half hardwood floors.  However, the LR doesn't require vacuuming at this time.   I realize that if I send it to the LR and select, ""Vac and Mop,"" it will correctly vacuum the rug and mop the hardwood floor.  So two questions:

1. If I send it to the LR and select ""Mop"" (only), will it disregard my carpets entirely and simply mop the half of my floor that consists of hardwood?
2. Is there any extra/hidden or full/complete manual I haven't seen that shows the machine's nuances and what will occur in these circumstances?  The online manual seems anemic and does little more than indicate features and troubleshooting.  Perhaps there's a manual for the app itself I haven't seen?

Thank you, folks! - Mike"
"LiDAR error ONLY when washing the mop?Haven’t had my S7 with the wash dock for long, but yesterday it started to exhibit this very strange behavior consistently:
- LiDAR turret spins
- Robot can map a new floor
- can start a cleaning job
- However, whenever it tries to wash the mop Error 1 is thrown."
"Timers/Schedules Not Working Consistently?I had an issue where one of my timers would only run once a week or so even though I scheduled it to run almost daily. Disabling and reenabling the timer didn’t help. In reaching out to support, they instructed me to change this timer by one minute and the issue has been resolved since!

Just thought I’d share this little tidbit in the hope it saves someone some frustration in the future.

Cheers.

Uncomfortable with new technology? I created a little Roborock app walkthrough video and you can find it at [https://youtu.be/va6uf9Cmaws](https://youtu.be/va6uf9Cmaws)."
"S7 Sidebrush Speed IncreaseI've had the S7 for a while now and the sidebrush has never been very fast, more of a consistent speed that works well enough...maybe 2-3 full rotations per second?

I just ran it today and the brush spins unbelievably fast now. It's to the point where it's spinning so fast, I can't see the brushes... It's just a blur.

Was this some type of update?"
"Standing waterSo I've been considering buying a s7 maxv ultra - but I haven't done it yet as I'm concerned with standing water on my floor - I have a large dog who cant keep the water he drinks in his mouth when hes done. Last think I want is an expensive s7 paperweight!

Anyone with any experience with this let me know how the s7 maxv handles standing water."
"Slightly Disappointed in Roborock S7 MaxV - A ReviewAfter watching multiple reviews, doing some research and posts, I decided to purchase a MaxV the other day off Amazon with the $90 off coupon. I eventually want to get the Ultra Dock, which I'm hoping alleviates some of my issues, but in the meantime I'm running the MaxV by itself in my relatively small house that mostly consists of hardware floors, and single large area rug. Over the past few days of ownership though I've been pretty disappointed with it's performance and now realize that my use case was not covered by most of the reviews/tests I've seen of the robot in various youtube videos, etc. I wanted to share my experiences here for anyone that's on the fence and might face a similar situation.

First some of the good things: One of the reasons why I wanted the roborock was for the AI features. I have a dog, a long haired german shepherd (named reggie) that loves to play with his toys but rarely (never) puts them away. My current Neato D5 often gets stuck on said toys, so I'm required to pick up and put away everything before I run it.. which makes it hard to schedule and leads me to running it less often than i'd like. The Roborock's AI features accel here. I can schedule it to run at a set time or multiple times and regardless to what's on the ground it does an excellent job of avoiding all the toys/cables/etc that my previous Neato would get stuck on or require no-go zones to avoid running into.

The other thing I love is the mopping. I live in a very wooded area and being that we are in April (lots of rain) Reggie often brings some mud in on his paws and onto the floor. The Max V's mopping quickly removes theses and keeps my wood floors very clean compared to how they were previously. I really love this feature.

\_

The negatives. I want to preface this by repeating that a lot of these issues are going to be specific to my house and I realize I'm probably in the minority but i also think that these issues can be remedied by different design choices or options..  I'll explain as I go on.

Bin Size. I came from a Neato D5 which has a 750ML bin. I would run the Neato every 2 days or so which would often result in the bin being completely full. I figured with the Max V and it's AI abilities, I would be able to run it more frequently as it would ignore the toys and each day I would just clean the bin out daily and it would be enough. I was wrong. The bin often fills 3/4's of a way through a cleaning cycle. The robot continues cleaning (it has no full bin sensor) and essentially a bunch of dog hair (again long haired shepherd has a ton of hair) gets jammed up in the roller/bin ""chute"". Unless I'm there to stop and clean it, it basically just doesn't clean 3/4's of the house. I was hoping that if it had a ""bin full"" sensor that when I got the ultradock it could return, empty it's bin then continue.. but no sensor. I've been told by other reddit users that a workaround is to divide the house up into multiple runs so it empties between each run. I'm going to try this when I eventually get the ultra dock but until then it's kind of a bummer. I'd prefer if it knew the bin was full and stopped/could return to empty when you do have a dock.. or it just had a larger bin to begin with. I have one dog, my fiance and me.. when we have kids, or if I decide to get another dog this thing is going to be overloaded before my house is even half clean.

Climbing Ability. I have what I'd consider a small threshold between my livingroom and kitchen. My Neato had no problem climbing over said transition but the Max V can't clear it. On top of that I also have a C desk that sits next to my couch and blocks a small corner area behind it. The part that sits on the ground of the desk is not very high.. maybe slightly more than 3/8"" inch? The Neato was able to go over this and clean the back corner of the room.. the Max V gets stuck on it. I had to zone the area off and I've just been manually cleaning it now.  I'm going to try changing the kitchen/living room transition for one with less height and hoping that fixes the issue.. the C table is whatever, I personally didn't expect the Neato to climb it when I first set it up but I guess the fact that it does and the Max V can't is a little disappointing, the kitchen threshold is just mind boggling to me though.

Carpet Cleaning. The area rug I have doesn't have particularly high pile - 1/4"". I notice a lot when I'm working out/doing yoga or whatever (laying on the floor) that Reggie's hairs' seem to get embedded into it a bit. The Neato's bristle brush seems to be able to yank these hairs out for the most part but to get them all out I need to pull out my Dyson and actually manually vacuum. The Max V's rubberbrush is horrible at removing these hairs. Even at max suction it leaves the rug covered in hair. Running my Neato after the Max V results in the Neato pulling not only a lot of hair but sandy/grit/dirt out of the rug that the Max V just didn't get for whatever reason. I would really like to see a bristle brush option for the Max V. I think it would resolve the hair issue.

Mopping. But wait I thought you said it's great? It is, but the one thing I don't like it has having to prewet the mop before I use it. I wanted to run the mop when I'm not home and Reggie is upstairs sleeping, which is usually about an hour or so after I leave the house but since I have to prewet the mop it's impossible. The Ultradock obviously fixes this (as far as a I know it prewets the mop) but I feel like having more areas on the robot itself that releases water would also fix this without the need of the expensive dock.

\_

In the end I'm probably going to keep it until I get the dock. If the dock doesn't fix the few issues it can, I'll probably sell it to my Mom who has been looking to buy one anyway and doesn't have the dog/threshold/climbing issues.

Again I just wanted to share my impressions of the device, it's shortcomings for my usecase and where I think they could improve in the future."
"Genuine Roborock S5 max mop pad colour and style?Hi All!

UPDATE: The new mopping pads that I bought in the official box from a proper store worked terrifically well, despite looking a lot like the terrible cheap ones I had bought online earlier. They're beige and brown. Will see how well they hold up in the washing machine on hand wash setting! 

Original post: Love my S5 Max, and for my (pretty clean) house, I find the mopping feature quite useful.

When I bought the machine around two years ago, it came with one fantastic grey, full-coverage mopping pad (not the older style ones with just the thicker material in the middle part) that has held up really well (over two years!) even with many machine-washes. It catches the dirt really consistently across it and is even. Edit: the ""good"" one that came with my machine looks like these ones: [https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-Robotic-Microfiber-Mopping-Generation/dp/B07BRH2TN7](https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-Robotic-Microfiber-Mopping-Generation/dp/B07BRH2TN7).

I wanted to have a couple of extras, so I bought some replacement pads from a store in Sweden not that long ago, and they looked completely different. More of a beige fabric with brown plastic around the upper edge. And they were terrible, and the quality in the stitching/material etc was super visible. When using them, the dirt only became visible around the edges, and after a couple of (hand!) washes, the plastic tubing fell out of the top bit you attach it with, and I had to throw them out. After looking online, it seemed like maybe the grey ones (like my original) were the real ones, and all the cheap fake poor quality ones were that beige/brown combo. The beige ones look like this:

Anyway, flash forward to today, and I found replacement mopping cloths in the proper Roborock box in a big, reputable electronics store. When I got them home and opened the box, they look exactly the same as the cheap nasty ones that fell apart after a couple of uses. Beige, poor stitching, different configuration, etc etc. The bad beige ones look more like this: [https://www.amazon.com/Microfiber-Compatible-Roborock-Washable-Replacement/dp/B09BJ9Q1VY/ref=sr\_1\_6?crid=FN9H1KSLVE89&keywords=roborock+s5+mop+pad&qid=1660409096&sprefix=roborock+s5+mop+p%2Caps%2C450&sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/Microfiber-Compatible-Roborock-Washable-Replacement/dp/B09BJ9Q1VY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=FN9H1KSLVE89&keywords=roborock+s5+mop+pad&qid=1660409096&sprefix=roborock+s5+mop+p%2Caps%2C450&sr=8-6)

So I wanted to ask - should the real Roborock-endorsed mopping pads be that original grey material, with the better quality? Or is Roborock now selling the beige/brown, poorer quality ones themselves? I also thought it might be possible that someone bought the real ones in the store, swapped them for some crappy online ones, and then returned them and the store didn't realize.

I really love my original mopping pad, and I'd love to track another down. Also didn't want to start to use these ones that I paid way more for if they're just the cheap fake ones!

Thanks so much for the help!"
"Roborock + HomeKit AutomationsHey Guys, 

when I try to google I always get news articles that roborock now supports shortcuts but I can't find any useful information about if it would be possible to trigger roborock when I do leave the house. 

I am selfemployed as an editor so my working times are not rly consistent so I don't want to use the normal ""start at time x"". Bit I can select to trigger an automation in Apple HomeKit when I leave the house. 

But with roborock it seems to only add shortcuts ... so my question is

Is there a way to trigger shortcuts with HomeKit ? (Without using a raspberry pi or something like that)"
"Roborock s7 - not sure if dispensing water and vibrating mopI got an s7 and mapped all my rooms. I then told it to vacuum and mop 2 rooms. All I saw was a thin streak of water going down the centre of wherever they roborock was going. 

Did some research and turns out you have to wet the mop first. Gave it a second go, wet the mop then told it to mop only this time instead of vacuum and mop. Initially saw a wide path of water so obviously the wet mop was dragging the water. But after a while noticed again it was just a thin streak of water. 

Second thing is I am not sure if the mop is vibrating. When I look at the mop I can’t really see it vibrating but that could just be due to the high rpm. Touch the mop attachment and feel a slight vibrating but not sure that could just be the robot motor under normal operations and not actually vibrating. 

Is there something I’m doing wrong ? An issue with the roborock? Something I need to clean?

I got the s7 about 2-3 months ago. Used the vacuum once as I was travelling. Now came back for the first time to try and vacuum and mop and noticed how it works."
"Can't get Google Assistant Voice Commands to workSo I've set up and mapped out my S7+ using the Roborock app. I've added my account to my Google Home app, and the bot appears in the app in the location the docking station is in. The room names in the Roborock app are consistent with the names in the Google Home app. However, I still can't get the robot to work with voice commands from my phone or a smart speaker with any of the following commands:

- ""Ask Roborock to clean the living room""
- ""Ask [Robot name] to clean the living room""
- ""Clean the living room""

"S7 MaxV - 2 Floor home w/ multiple levels per floor?Just got my S7 MaxV earlier this week and I'm trying to create maps, but running into issue's due to the nature of my Home. It is multilevel consisting of 2 floors (not counting the basement, so... Main Floor and a Second floor) The issue is that each floor has raised/lowered rooms. For example: The first floor Kitchen/dining room area is a single step higher than the entry way, the Kids room is a step higher than the kitchen, and the great room is three steps lower than the kitchen. The second floor is similar with three separate areas, each a step apart.  There's also a landing area on the stairs (30-40 square feet) between the two floors.

Soooo... How do I go about Mapping this out correctly? I've tried doing one room on the second floor, pausing and moving to the lower area, but when it looks for it's new position it identifies drastically off and then tries to clean the new area as a different part of another room. I've tried doing the Matrix mapping of both rooms, but that doesn't seem to make a difference at all. 

What would help would be the ability to have it scan one room as a new map and then merge it onto an existing one. Is that possible?"
"Is there a way to add custom voice on roborock 7?Is there a way to add custom voice for the roborock 7 ? or use the roborock speaker to play somthing like music, while its cleaning?

"Roborock S7+ Firmware SuggestionsSo this is mainly directed at anyone in the Roborock software engineering department that cares for a little constructive feedback. I was a Roborock S7+ and Auto Empty Bin early adopter for both products, without a doubt the construction of both is the highest quality and I have been nothing but completely happy with both products up to the this point. However over the past 5-ish months, the firmware updates have really deteriorated my experience. The robot is consistently having navigation issues, finding areas of the home that just don’t exist, and at times now just gets lost and I have to pick it up as it sadly wanders around my home. I've done a re-map twice already at this point. None of these issues existed on the earlier version of the firmware. So I’m going to up front what I think the issue is, I really believe the firmware and cleaning algorithms have just been way over engineered. As an Electrical Engineer who does design work as well as Systems Engineer who is a manager, I understand the impulse to iterate on your product to fully envelope all your edge cases and to provide a product that provides 99.9999% coverage for your customer. At some point you reach a point of diminishing return and in this instance, I would argue provide a WORSE customer experience. The robot vacuum should provide a 95% cleaning solution for your customers, it will never fit into those odd little corners or get the dirt out of every crevice, and while I appreciate the engineering team trying, its really throwing my robot for a loop. In evidence of this, the first picture I uploaded was a custom zone cleanup, in the past I’ve done this exact zone before and the robot has done great, done in less than 10 minutes with minimal battery usage. However consistently now when we specify this cleaning zone, the robot obsesses over getting into the corner where my TV stand connects with the wall. In the picture you can see the robot going all the way around my house 2-3 time trying to get itself into that corner. It also obsesses over the chair in the northern part of the image, trying many many times to get all the way around the legs. This tiny zone cleaning took 20min to complete and used 16% of the battery, that is a huge change from earlier version of the firmware. In the second picture I uploaded, I had specified a room cleanup for the area I have specified as the “dining room,” the robot just left the cleaning area inexplicably and just stopped, had to pick it up and drop it back at the base station. So anyways, I’ll wrap this up, on the one hand I completely respect the Roborock engineering teams commitment to continuing to hone and develop their firmware/algorithms. But just asking you, take a step back, and make sure the positive changes you are trying to make are not having unintended negative impacts on your customers experience.

"S4 max, new’ish user, any high threshold tricks?Pretty much title: Just switched from Roomba to Roborock S4max. Very happy with it, but I have a high threshold into my kitchen. It’s made it in there before when I did a manual zone clean, but it doesn’t consistently make it and it never makes it during regularly scheduled cleans (yes, the kitchen is set up to be included). I know it’s capable, but not sure how to ‘encourage’ it to try harder. Anyone have ideas?

Additional info: The kitchen floor is cork and I installed it and built the transition myself. I could knock the squared shoulder off, but it would still be the same height. Would just go from 90 degree shoulder to a 45 degree, for example. The transition from one floor to the other is about 3/4 of an inch. 

Thanks, in advance, for any help/suggestions!"
"suction power S7, S6 MAX, and S5 MAXBased on the specs, the S7 and S6 MAXV have 2500Pa suction, while the S5 MAX only has 2000.

Yet in every YouTube reviewer test, the S5 MAX consistently has the best deep cleaning on carpet.

Any ideas as to why?"
"S7 Water OutputI'm a new S7 owner and am curious about the water output of the S7 Mop.

Prior to mopping, I soak the mop pad and wring it out. I see that it puts out a nice, wide spread trail of water for the first 30 minutes or so of mopping. As it runs and drys up, I notice that the water track it leaves behind is smaller and less consistent. The water tank is lowering as it goes so it's putting out water.

Is this normal? Should I soak the mop pad after each room?"
"Network Slow. Please Wait.So we have a brand new Roborock S5 Max, purchased from Amazon UK.

It went through the wifi set up perfectly but all we get is:

""Loading Map""  (For a few seconds)

THEN

""Network Slow. Please Wait""

 

**Stuff of Interest:**

The S5 max has a solid blue light.

The router has a 2.4 Ghz network and is enabled.

Security is WPA2

Password contains only letters and numbers.

The wifi signal is full 3 bars and I am getting 72Mb/ps.

There is NO issue with our network.

Anybody else getting this infuriating crap?

This is our second S5 Max, the first one had a failed motor but this is a new issue to deal with.

Thanks folks,."

"Roborock S5 Max hacked: being used as data mule?I've been running the Roborock S5 Max pretty happily for over 6 months now. It’s been really nice to have the vacuuming taken care of consistently: Win! However, in the last 3 weeks it looks like my *device has been hacked*. How do I know this?

**Answer**: Around mid December something started sending my S5 a giant truckload of data: almost 4 TB in an hour. Yes, you read that right: my robot vac ***was sent almost 4 TERABYTES*** in 3.5 BILLION packets. During that time, the S5 device attempted to transmit 468 GB (see image below).

[Graph of network traffic into the Roborock. The big green spike is a 3.5 billion packet dump, smaller spikes are 500 to 800 million packet dumps.](https://preview.redd.it/d2wv3unna7961.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=58e964f3c93768371c50aac2ff053e6a74b6acc1)

*Edit: Per discussions below, receiving or transmitting this much data is physically impossible for the hardware involved, so the working theory is that there is massive packet loss going on. Somewhat like pointing a firehose at a drinking straw, some of the water will get through, but most of it falls on the floor.*

This event, of course, pissed me off. What possible legitimate use case would there be for SENDING a robot vacuum 4TB of data? None that I can think of. I’ve done a little reading on the Roborock / Xiaomi devices and the data they generate from LIDAR scanning, but it seems like that would generate a much larger upstream (transmit) load, rather than an overwhelming amount of ***received*** data. I haven’t done anything to hack the vac. I have allowed it to update it’s firmware through the official Roborock mobile app, other than that, it is as it came in the shipping box.

I’m happy to hear explanations of this activity somehow being legitimate network use, but you better be damned convincing.

My response has been to limit the devices on my IoT network (which is ONLY this device at the moment) to a low bandwidth. This action seemed to stem the tide, but the device was still receiving almost half a terabyte every few days, usually during the dead of night, and sending out between 50 and 100GB during that same time. You can see those as the smaller green spikes in network use on the right side of the traffic graph.

Now, today, I’ve had two instances where the device was pushing more than a terabyte in an hour, one early this morning and another just after lunch time. This data dumping probably explains why the S5 vacuum suddenly got a case of the stupids during its cleaning run this afternoon: forgetting to clean two rooms and utterly failing to find its way back to its dock. Since my software networking restrictions don’t seem to be working, I pulled the S5 vacuum off the charger and powered it down.

I’m interested to hear comments, particularly about:

1. How to report to the Roborock folks that their device is being hacked (assuming they care).
2. How to shut down the jerks who are stealing a huge chunk of my bandwidth though my robot vacuum, aside from completely shutting off the vac and not using it, which I’m certainly considering.

Oh, and here’s my theory for what’s going on: The S5 device is being used as a data mule by some bad actors: dumping data to the vacuum in order to pass it on to some other location, possibly to hide the source of the data transmission. Based on the research I’ve done, the Roborock vacs are basically  embedded Linux boxes, and there is plenty of bad stuff you can get up to with unrestricted access to an operating system and a network connection.

# UPDATE #2 - 1/4/2021

Thanks for all the comments so far. Here's an update;

I powered down the Roborock S5 Max overnight. I turned it back on this morning to let it do it's Monday routine and the device has been very quiet, network-wise: not more than 100 packets sent or received over any 5 minute period for 90 minutes or so.

* I changed the Wifi password for the isolated IoT Wifi network that the Roborock has been on this whole time. After two attempts to reset the Wifi settings on the Roborock, it wouldn't get on the network with the new password.
* Shortly after these attempts to reconnect it with a new password, my Unifi switch went into an ""Adoption failed"" state, causing some devices on my regular Wifi network not to be able to reconnect (including my phone). Some of the disconnected devices reported ""DHCP configuration"" errors. I reset the switch and had to reboot the Unifi controller to get the client devices working again, and get the switch to be re-adopted.

This network breakdown caused one of my daughters to miss one of her online class meetings. By this point I'd had enough messing around with the vacuum and just shut it down. **I plan to do some more testing, and I'd appreciate any tips on how to do that**, but I'm considering my S5 compromised until proven otherwise. I still haven't seen a reasonable explanation for the network behavior I'm seeing from this device.

While it may be that Unifi is miscalculating the total volume of traffic, I believe it is measuring *something*. I also wonder if what I'm seeing is just massive packet spam coming into the device. Most of it doesn't make it through (e.g., 90% of packets gets dropped), but the packets are being counted anyway.

# UPDATE #3: 1/8/2021

Tonight I tried resetting the Wifi connection on my Roborock S5 Max again, using a new, longer password, per suggestions here. The Roborock is on an isolated IOT wifi network, so it can't talk to any other devices on my network. Here's what happened:

1. I put the Roborock in the ""Reset Wifi"" state.
2. I put my phone on the isolated IOT wifi network and fired up the Roborock app.
3. I connected to the Roborock through bluetooth and went through the steps to reset the Wifi. The app reported getting through 2 of the 3 steps, and then got hung up on the third step, eventually giving me the red X failure indicator.
4. I then pulled the vacuum off the charger and power cycled it (OFF --> ON)

I cycled through steps 3 and 4 two more times. Each time the Roborock reported a failure to connect to my network.

*Shortly after this, my entire home network stopped working.*

Both my Unifi Access Points and my Unifi switch were reported as ""Adoption Failed"" in the Unifi controller web interface just before that web application became unreachable as well. All traffic on my home network, wired and wireless, stopped flowing. I had to power cycle the Unifi controller and my switch and, luckily, everything came back up OK.

After I got everything booted up and connected again, I went back into the Unifi controller web interface to try to figure out what happened, and found this:

[Graph of network traffic from the \*mostly\* disconnected Roborock.](https://preview.redd.it/ner0w9xvp9a61.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0158620db06574fddbe3680e48905739b5e4dea8)

Between 9:35pm and 9:40pm, the Roborock \*DID\*, in fact, connect to my network (despite the Roborock app information to the contrary), and sent out 2 packets, totaling 724 bytes. Immediately following this event, all traffic on my network stopped. You can see this very clearly from this graph of several other wired and wireless devices on my network, below. All traffic stopped at 9:35pm, right after the Roborock sent those 2 packets, and it didn’t come back until I got both the Unifi controller and switch rebooted, around 10pm:

[Graph of network traffic from several wired and wireless devices on my network during the same time frame as the previous graph.](https://preview.redd.it/6q69dug3q9a61.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2d2989586e64a9320a9d2e8d6f3fc565b41fca5)

***I consider this data a smoking gun.***

It’s very clear to me that the firmware on my Roborock was or has been compromised, and that  software deliberately attacked my home network, with the intent to disrupt it. Clearly the attack was quite successful, if only temporarily.

I have no idea how widespread this issue might be. Hopefully, this is an isolated case, but I really have no idea. What I do know is this device has been part of an attempt to steal huge chunks of my network bandwidth for several weeks and has now attacked and disrupted my home network twice.

If you have one of these devices (specifically the Roborock S5 Max), I encourage you to treat it with extreme suspicion. You should take steps to isolate it from the rest of your network and other connected devices, or simply shut it off.

# UPDATE #4: 1/18/2021

Hey folks, this is likely my last update on this topic. Here goes:

Last weekend, I factory reset my Roborock S5 Max, per some of your suggestions, in the hopes that this suspicious network activity would go away. I really had no choice other than to reset the device, since after resetting my Wifi password several times, the device ***refused to reconnect to my network and disabled my network equipment*** in the process, on two, separate attempts.

Since my last post, I've made these updates:

* Factory reset my Roborock S5 Max
* Changed my wifi password to a significantly longer, randomly generated string
* Reconnected the S5 Max to an isolated Wifi network, by itself (no other devices)
* Throttled the bandwidth for that Wifi network to a max of 10mbps up and down
* Set up scheduled outages for that Wifi network so that it's only up for several hours a day, when the robot is supposed to be cleaning (so the network is unavailable the majority of the day)

Even after factory resetting the device and making these changes, the suspicious network behavior DID NOT STOP.

While the Roborock didn't take down my network reconnected it, the ***suspicious network behavior has continued,*** as you can see below:  

[My Roborock's network activity for the last 2 weeks. Note the continued massive spikes of inbound traffic while the device is allowed on my wifi network. \(I had the vac shut off from 1\/5\/ to 1\/9, before I did the factory reset.\) ](https://preview.redd.it/pl3bxy11n7c61.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4e9dfe0492620c0873a4812fefc3b769bbd8f19)

The only thing that has changed is that the behavior has is now at a lower volume, down to a peak of a 150 million packets received in an hour and 60 million sent. The lower volume is due to the bandwidth throttling I've imposed on this network, specifically to curb this ridiculous, if not outright malicious, network behavior.

***Resetting the firmware didn't get rid of the problem***, and it looks like my vacuum is now on a list of exploitable devices for who-knows-what purpose. What I find most alarming about this is that it means that whatever ***security exploit was in the original firmware that shipped with the device***. 

One more bit of data for you all before I put this thing in the incinerator:

[Summary of deep packet inspection findings from my Roborock S5 Max.](https://preview.redd.it/08myycyyp7c61.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be497a779ea4f3a86e671d67cc57c7f9810f3dee)

Apparently my vacuum is sending data to a social network called Miliao. What is that, you ask? I had no idea either, but apparently it's a [social network operated by Xiaomi](https://www.techinasia.com/miliao-xiami-music-sharing), part owner of Roborock. What the hell is a vacuum doing sending data to a social media site? I have no idea.

&#x200B;

What I find most alarming about this latest round of testing is that a ***factory reset hasn't fixed the problem,*** which means lots of other folks may be exposed to this problem. I was thinking that I might have got a compromised firmware update, but is seems like whatever exploit is being used came with the device.

Again, I encourage folks using this device to treat it with extreme caution, isolate it from the rest of your network, or just shut it down and stop using it, which is exactly what I'll be doing."
"S5Max suddenly won't connect to networkI've been using my S5Max for over a year with no issues and suddenly it no longer connects to the network. I've tried resetting wifi, using a different mobile device with the app, even tried the MiHome app instead of the Roborock app at the suggestion of Roborock support but nothing is working. It consistently fails at the third step after passing the first two steps.

Has anyone had a similar issue resolved? I'm still waiting to hear back from support but I'm wondering if it's a lost cause."
"S6 MaxV - AI Object Avoidance recommendations?I got a S6 MaxV around Christmas and after about a month of use I'm having mixed feelings about it. 

I find that while it is nice to have more consistently clean floors, this thing just needs so much constant attention and so regularly get's stuck on things or doesn't finish cleaning all the spaces it's supposed to that it's almost more of a hassle than it's worth. 

Here's a list of pretty normal things for a real human to have on their floors at any given time that really throw the robot for a loop: 

* Shoes
* Bath mats 
* Pet food/water bowls 
* Runner Rugs not securely fixed to the ground 
* Cords 
* Any moderately large trash like a napkin, or packaging plastic
* Clothing 
* doors that are sometimes open and sometimes closed 
* Miscellaneous trash cans or other small containers that live on the floor but are too light to trigger the wall sensor. 

There are so many things the object avoidance just won't pick up on, so even though I've added like 5 no-go zones the robot will still stupidly ram and mount on top of things and either get stuck or push things where they're not supposed to be. For instance, we have an entry way table we like to kick our shoes off under, so I no-go-zoned that, but heaven forbit one flip flop is sticking our a few inches past the line that's hard to visualize in the app, and then it will run it over and drag it into the middle of the room. Also, our bath mat is no-go-zoned, but you know sometimes it moves around a bit. I like to push it to the sink when I shave and if I don't put it back in the exact right spot again it get's mounted and pushed around. We leave our bedroom door at least 1/2 open every night, but even when there's plenty or room for the robot to come in, it just decides ""nah I don't feel like it"" about half the time. 

I'm no slob, and try and keep my place tidy but sometimes you just forget about a cord or just a sock that got tossed towards the laundry bin, but fell to the floor, and those things can completely wreck havoc on this thing.  So now, it feels like I have a 10min chore every night to move the rug, bathmat, any shoes, and stuff off the ground, and another 5min chore to reset the place in the morning. Comparatively, I used to use a Dyson stick vac and it only takes about 15mins to manually vacuum my whole place, and it's just done then. Not this constant repeated chore that causes nightly anxiety. 

I specifically bought this model in hopes that it would be smart enough to avoid things, but it doesn't seem to work the majority of the time. 

Has anyone had success getting the AI avoidance to you know actually avoid things?

Edit: I have tried cleaning the camera sensor."
"Error 10 - Check the filter I've had my S5 for about 6 months now and to date it has been great. We use it for vacuuming exclusively (no mopping).

"My Roborock S7 : Malfunctionning or just technology limitation?Hello !

I have a brand new Roborock S7, it works overall very well, in particular when i ask it to clean everywhere. Very amazing to me since it's my first robot vacuum .

I have though consistency issues when I ask to clean some specific rooms. It seems the robot has some trouble to consistently evaluate the distances.

My SS function on my phone is down but here's an magnificient mspaint explanation

https://preview.redd.it/xax310hhlrj71.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc088186f6106b4ca0a3677297621dd3a26a0cb3

So when I ask my roborock to clean for instance room 3, he would sometime think he arrived at room 3 when he is at room 2, or sometime would arrive to room 4 and still thinking it's room 3 according to his positionning. I can clearly see on the app that he thinks he goes faster/slower than he actually does. Sometime it works perfectly fine.

I've check the wheels which I assume measure the distances but they seem fine. Maybe i'm wrong and i have to check the base which send an erroneous signal ?

It's a bit annoying because sometime, i assume because of it, the map gets modified wrongly.

I'm gathering some feedback to understand if it's malfunctionning or just that I need to lower my expectations on this amazing robot

Thanks in advance"
"Issues with my S7, help!Recently purchased a S7 with the auto empty tank. Tank is fantastic, absolutely love it. My issue is the actual S7 gets stuck multiple times on miner things making it around my house and consistently has connection issues. It’s getting stuck on things like door stoppers on my base board, a/c floor vents, and other typical things. Is there something that I’m missing? My S5 is the best money I’ve ever spent in my life, so based on that had pretty high expectations however for the price point of the S7/empty tank it’s majorly disappointing."

is it possible to rotate the map?I have both upstairs and downstairs mapped. However the orientation of the maps is not consistent. I tried but didn't find there is a way to rotate the map. Is there any trick to make the rotation of the map?
"Main Brush IssuesI posted in the past to find out if the FW update solved this issue but got a lot of anecdotal, confirmation bias, opinions from roborock fans who seem to need to justify their buying decision but nothing factual, so I started researching.

You see, I owned an s6maxV and sent two back after having what I thought were issues with the main brush.

Long story short, RR told me about the stalling issue and suggested another model. S7.

Then I bought a Dreame L10 which was great (cleans well, but support seemed suspect, and the app is not as good as RR. I purchased via a reseller who Dreame would not directly support, so I returned it... if you buy this, buy it directly from Dreame)

I spoke to RR support Monday to ask again for advice about which CURRENT model to get for mid-pile carpet. (My home is 80% carpet) The prime day was here, and I need to get a robot vacuum, and RR had some decent but not amazing deals.

I was told the following by RR:

For the main brush issue, there is a protection system in the robot sent via FW to avoid internal system damage. (Well documented past issue with this) The FW update was the fix.

When the brush faces high friction like on a carpet for a certain period, the brush will stop running to protect the robot.

https://youtu.be/aIJXERoA8cA

The pause is temporary, and the brush WILL resume running. The process will cycle if the brush keeps facing high friction. Additionally, the suction strength will increase to max automatically when the robot reaches the carpet if you have enabled the carpet mode.

The gearbox and brush are the same in the s4max, s5max, S6maxv, and s7

I asked if my 1st refurbished model had a lessor motor, and I was told there was never a change made to the gearbox in production units, refurbished units are tested, and the behavior seen in the video I provided was consistent with the expected performance post FW update and the 2nd NEW unit that was sent.

The hope is the rubber s7 brush will not stick, BUT it will not pick up carpet hair as well as the bristle brushes models. (She noticed I had a dog in my video, PM me and I can share the videos)

Support mentioned that the brush does not need to spin consistently to clean the carpets adequately. The combination of suction and brush rotation and multiple passes will clean the carpets.

The RR rep added the combination of pile length AND material lead to friction which caused motors to burn out prior to the update.

RR said the prior s4 and s5 models did not receive the same FW update and are more susceptible to motor burnout, and the S4max was raised higher to help combat motor burnout. 

I would guess other lessor brands with similar designs have similar issues. RR is just large enough to have engineers develop a solution

My 360 s9 gave me the main brush stuck message every ten runs, and their solution was to cut the rubber fins off the brush. (Sent that one back)

RR support is excellent and responsive. 

I am JUST reporting what I was told; if you would like confirmation, please call or email RR.

Since my environment is mainly carpet and Amazon prime day had a great sale on the I6, I bought one. Excited to see how cleaning performance and navigation compare

Trolls, no need to respond. Yes, I did edit this message to provide a more complete recap and correct a few typos."
"Roborock S5 Max battery life questionTwo questions. 

I just got my vacuum yesterday and I’ve tried to map the upstairs a couple times but the battery dies before it can finish. The battery goes down at a consistent rate but both times it instantly dropped from about 35% life to 19% life. Is that normal? 

At what point will it go back to mapping the floor? I thought maybe when the battery life hit about 30% but no. Then I read if it’s the first time mapping, 80%, but no on that too. I assumed it started back up automatically, but maybe I’m supposed to start it again?"
"roborock app vs Mi HomeI tried both (on android. IOS users YMMV).  You can switch from one app to the other without losing your map. You just install the app and link the roborock by pressing both buttons for 3 seconds (of S5 max).

They seem to draw on the same code, and are very similar but some differences I noticed so far:

\- Naming rooms is only possible in Mi Home. In theory naming rooms  allows me to tell google assistant to clean a specific room, however:

\- Linking Alexa and google home only works in Roborock app, I cant get either working in Mi Home.

\- Firmware version numbering is totally different, but they do seem to use the same firmwares, just name them differently. Roborock provides newer firmware than Mi Home on my S5M. I did not upgrade to the latest one to see if it works in Mi Home.

\- Sharing a robot works fine (\*) in Mi Home, I couldnt get it working in Roborock app, where the other person is consistently not found. (\*) NB: removing the share does NOT remove the other persons access to the robot!

\- Getting a token to integrate roborock in Home Assistant requires an older version of Mi Home. You can upgrade Mi Home after getting the token. However, linking the  robovac to Roborock app invalidates that token, so you can switch apps and maintain your HA integration.

Since I want both Home Assistant and Google Home integration,  I guess Im stuck between a (robo)rock and a hard place.."
"Roborock S6 issuesmy S6 consistently gets stuck and shows the ""error 5: brush roller jammed"" message even when there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. I've taken out the roller and removed the traces of hair that aren't even impeding movement dozens of times but it still throws the error consistently to a point where I can estimate when and where it will get stuck. I've tried all power levels with no change. The area it's cleaning is low-pile carpet, nothing crazy about it at all. What's the deal? Is this just a bad model?"
"Do you think Roborock will add Y-mopping cleaning to their robots?For those that don't know, Y-mopping style cleaning consists in mopping the floor in a Y pattern move, it's a bit more efficient that normal mopping, although it takes a bit more time to cover the same area.
It looks like something that could be released in a firmware update.

The recently released Viomi V3 supports this and it's in the same price point as an S5 Max."
"Map orientation algorithm?I got a Roborock (S6 Pure) and have multiple floors. It cleaned the first floor and made a map, and when I put it on another floor the map was in a different orientation - but not consistent to how I had it oriented when I turned it on. 

In other words, it was pointing east (buttons in the east side) on floor 1, and ended up making a map oriented with south on top. 2nd floor, I started it pointing north, and it made a map with WEST on top. 3rd floor, started it pointing east like the 1st floor, and the map has west on top again.

Clearly the orientation isn’t related to the starting orientation. I saw some 1-2 year old threads speculating about this but am wondering if anyone figured out the algorithm since then.

It’s not that big a deal (as long as it doesn’t mess up its map on subsequent cleanings as I saw some people experienced - I will see if that happens). But, would be good to know."
"S6 on bright floors?Hello,

I have a question regarding Roborock S6. ( I have tried to find people with similar problem but didn't have much luck); I'm considering purchasing S6 as it's really good value + does both mopping and vaccuming, but in the description of the product it does say that it might have trouble with really bright/white flooring. My house consists mostly of hardwood and cream/white tiles (mostly matt), and I'm a bit concerned if that's not going to create an issue and maybe I should go for Braava M6. Therefore my question:

"How can I find a list of robot vacuum models and the carpet ply thickness that they're capable of vacuuming?Hi all,

I have been struggling with my Roborock S4 for a few years now and am just about ready to throw in the towel.  

My problem is that the S4 really sucks at vacuuming **medium** ply carpet.  When it gets to the carpeted rooms, it rolls around just fine but randomly gets an error saying that its stuck on something.  Ultimately, I've had to create no go zones for the 3 carpeted rooms.  Is there a solution to this problem that I'm missing?  It feels largely like a software issue since it, functionally, has no problem actually rolling through the rooms.

If there's not a solution to this model, are all Roborock models the same in terms of carpet ply capabilities?  My hope is that I can upgrade to a newer model and these problems won't exist. 

Thanks in advance for any info you can provide."
"S8 Pro Ultra - talks way too muchI love the capabilities so far, but this thing talks way too much.  I know I can turn the volume down, but then I won't hear an important message that I suspect exists (like water tank empty, or dirty tank full)... I'd love to see a setting in the software that lets you choose which verbal announcements you want to hear... A switch for every single verbal announcement it's capable of.  In a 400sf clean it said ALL of this with mop washing interval set at 20 minutes.

"Q Revo On Carpet?How would Q Revo perform on medium pile carpet?

I've never had a robot vacuum and was stalking Roborock's IG for the S8 with dual rollers--but the price tag..🫠 

I have a ragdoll and a maine coon, and im hoping for some maintenance during the week on their shedding/not having hair clumps everywhere. I do a deep vacuum and deshed on the weekend. 

I'm mostly seeing info about its mopping capabilities but only 1/4 of my house needs mopping. Would this still be 'worth it' if my main concern is the carpet?

It seems Roborock is worth diving into robot vacuums for, just trying to see if im delusional with the medium pile 🙏😅

I appreciate any help!"
"Should I get an S8 pro Ultra/S8Plus or an S7 MaxV Ultra/Plus?Hi,

Conflicted on which to get. They work out to basically the same amount since the S8 Pro Ultra is 1600 but I have $200 off from buying a Dyad Pro. The thing is I don't know that I really need the mopping capability. I have all hardwood floors in my house but also have a Narwal Freo which I believe will likely be better for mopping. The one issue with the free is the dust bin doesn't self empty. I'm wondering if it is worth it to get the ultra models or just get the S8+ or S7 MaxV plus. 

Also curious since it seems the S7 isn't great with pet hair and I have 3 long hair dogs, but the S8 has less suction.

&#x200B;

Anyone in a similar position and what did you do?"
"Seeking Recommendations for First Robot Vacuum (S7 MaxV, S8 or... S8 Ultra Pro)Greetings, Roborock community!

I'm excited to venture into the world of robot vacuums and would greatly appreciate your assistance in selecting the perfect model for my needs. Here are the key points to consider:

1. New to Robot Vacuums, I never owned one before!

2. Apartment Details: I live in a 65 sqm flat with a mix of carpets and hardwood floors. There are no pets in the household.

3. Top-Notch Performance: I'm looking for the best robot vacuum available in terms of both vacuuming and mopping capabilities.

4. Delaying Dock Purchase: Since this is my first robot vacuum experience, I'm hesitant to invest in a dock right away. I'd like to test the vacuum's performance and suitability before committing to a docking station.

5. Model Choices: After some research, I've narrowed down my options to the Roborock S8 and S7 MaxV. However, I'm hesitant about the S8 Ultra Pro, it feels really the best but it would force me to buy a dock right away and I would love to avoid that.

Given these considerations, I would greatly appreciate any tips, advice, or personal experiences you can share. Which model would you recommend based on my preferences?

Thanks!"
"Fully carpeted apartmentHi all,

I've done abit reading and learnt that the Q series are generally the best for carpet (not sure about S8) - however the Q5 isn't available here in Oz and we have only the Q7 Q7+ which I believe have rubber rollers and then the S series and Roomba etc.

Could I please get some advice as to which are the best models available for my use (perhaps re carpet mopping power and obstacle detection and general stable mapping capabilities)? Happy to consider other brands too.

 Whilst I dont have a strict budget, I am keen to avoid paying for unnecessary features given my whole apartment is fully carpeted.

I get the idea that the Q7/Q7+ or S5 Max, S6 MaxV and S7 may be good enough but also not too sure how to rank it in preference order.

Thanks!"
"Roborock s7 maxv with default and q5+ brushI read a lot of comments about using Q5+ brush for better results. I experimented with both and found that:
1. Q5+ brush is the best for hairs but it decreases the collection of dust
2. Q7 brush is the best for dust and decreases the collection of hair

I think somehow the suction capability is impacted by the q5+ brush because as soon as I change brush and run of the s7 brush, I collect a lot of dust. 

I live in an apartment on carpeted floor. Have decided to run most days with s7 brush and once a week switch over to the q5+ brush.

Just my experience and thought someone might want to know."
Can any Roborock vacuums be programed to do a predetermined sequence of movements?I'm looking at robot vacuums for my new house that has three floors.  I'm trying to find one that I can preprogram to follow a particular path so I can tell it to go into a dumbwaiter to move between floors.  Are any of the roborock mop/vacuums capable of this?  Any other recommendations?
Which model would be capable of detecting these kind of slender table and chair legs?
"I bought the water kit for the S7 MaxV, need a power supplyCan anyone recommend one?
Would any of 20v work without damaging the pump? If I'm not mistaken, the voltage should be the same, but the wattage can be the same or higher without issues, right?

Is the pin radius this device uses standard?

Thanks."
"Best Roborock for my needs?Looking to get my first Roborock, but not sure which one to pull the trigger on.

My house is completely laminate/tile, no carpet at all. I have a dog that sheds a medium amount. Really just looking for vacuuming and mopping capabilities. I don’t think I want to pay the extra money for the auto dispenser. I’m also looking to stay below $600 if possible. With these facts in mind, which machine would best suit my needs?"
"Wanting to purchase S8U. Have carpet question.So I've been waiting for the S8U. Today I read that the carpet plate lifts 5mm, and the unit is capable of cleaning 4mm high carpets because of the mop pad dragging. 

My house is probably 40% tile and 60% carpet. Kitchen and baths are tile.

My carpets are what I would describe as medium pile. I'm not home now so I can't measure. But, 4mm is damn short.. like carpet in a hotel. Mine are definitely taller than 4mm. 

Is the S8U, or Roborock, for that matter, a no-go for me? 

Can anyone with experience give an opinion please?

Thanks"
"S8 Navigation IssuesS8+ set for reactive obstacle avoidance and Less collision mode but still doing some weird stuff. For example, even driving down a mapped hallway, instead of just smoothly driving along the edge of the wall like my S5 did, it veers right and constantly taps the wall having to then turn and straighten out. Like every 4 inches. Seems it should be able to just drive next to it without bumping. But it is capable of driving straight not along that wall. Like in open spaces.

First robot with obstacle avoidance. But it seems finicky. it thinks it randomly sees things in the middle of the open floor and attempts to go around them then marks them as cones on the map. I've cleaned the front sensor window things. I also understand it's not great at detecting small things like cables, but I thought it would be able to detect a tight, thick clump of a rats nest of cables. But it doesn't, it just runs into it over and over. Sometimes gets stuck and needs help, other times can get out of it. I don't usually have a clump of cables laying on the floor, but after noticing it having issues the time the cables were there, I decided to leave them to see if the bots behavior would adapt. It doesn't seem to.

Is my bot acting as expected or could my front sensors be goofed or something?"
"""Avoid"" carpet setting doesn't exist in my app - S7 MaxVIs my robot capable of this? I've seen screenshots of the setting but my app doesn't have it."
"Roborock S7 possible or wishlist?I'm wondering if my S7 has any of these capabilities and I just haven't found them yet?  

* App presets to clean certain rooms or spots with just the push of a preset button?  
* Ability to select direction of flooring planks, so mopping can happen in that direction
* Custom reminders, to remind me to change the mop after set number of moppings"
"What are the differences between the S8 series and S7 MaxV series?I'm just trying to understand all of the differences in features and capabilities.

Ones I think I know about - S8 Pro Ultra dock has dryer standard. S8 series robots have dual rubber brushes vs. single in S7 MaxV series. S8 has more suction. S8 loses remote view and obstacle photos. S8 Pro Ultra is actually a different robot from other S8 series (non removable water tank and mopping pad bracket.)

Anything else?"
"updated S5 capabilities vs S5 MaxThe S5 seems to be on sale for \~ $350 these days while the S5 Max is $550 at the cheapest. Add tax and that's more than $200 difference between them. 

Does S5 lag really behind S5 max today, after accounting for recent software updates? Can someone with S5 please post if the following features work with the S5 with the latest updates:

&#x200B;

1. Ability to divide up house into rooms
2. Scheduling room cleaning
3. Water drip control - is gravity control (S5) really worse than the S5 Max? 
4. No-go zones (I hear S5 has them)
5. No-mop zones  (I hear S5 doesn't have them)
6. Ability to climb thresholds
7. Other issues I haven't thought of..

What real world situations is the S5 Max better at?"
First time being disappointed
"Charging base for S7 Maxv ultraI recently bought an S7 Maxv Ultra and it's great for the main floor. However, I don't think I can complete mopping on the 2nd floor without splitting it and manually relocating it. I was thinking if I could just add a charge only base station on the second floor for convenience.

Has anyone done this?

Could someone please send me a link to a working after market charging base?

Thanks"

"Does the S7 MaxV object recognition get better with time?The S7 MaxV is my first robot vacuum and while the cleaning is phenomenal, I am a little disappointed with it's object recognition capabilities. I have a tangle of wires next to my nightstand, connected to a power strip, and it always sucks up the wires. It also cannot identify low obstacles such as the base of my speaker stands.

I have been using no go zones to get around it but honestly it's a little disappointing that such an expensive piece of equipment cannot recognize objects the way it's advertised.

I am wondering if there is some sort of ai that actually learns and improves the object recognition, or am I stuck with using no go zones?"
"You think your Roborock is mopping really well? Think again 😳We bought a Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, and we are generally quite happy with all the autonomy it provides. But we also knew that the robot was not capable of cleaning deeply our wooden floors. Even cleaning with deep mopping 2-3 times a week we knew the cleaning sessions would need something stronger from time to time. 

We live in a 2014 modern one floor flat of 4 rooms, around 140 m2 (1550 square feet) in Switzerland, and we decided to also buy a Bissell Crosswave cleaner, the idea behind is to use it once a month or so for a deep clean session all around the flat. 

We started to remove our shoes at the entrance of the house and use sleepers when walking inside to help reduce the amount of dirt we bring from the street. 

We were really surprised when we found out how much dirt was extracted from the Bissell dirty water repository. Really disgusting as you can see on the video.

Floors didn’t look terribly dirty at the look of the eye, but after seeing how dark the water extracted from the Bissel was, we got really concerned. 

Did you encounter a similar experience as we did?
Thanks for sharing your thoughts"
"Roborock S5 Max Custom Voice PacksHey all,

i sucessfully rooted my vacuum and installed Valetudo following different guides and resources(Used Dustbuilder and mostly instructions from there). After assembly its up and running and Valetudo looks great! BUT i really want to install a custom voice on it. So far ive tried an Android app from XDA (Returns an error as soon as installation starts) and the Webinterface(cant figure out how to upload also what hash). I have the Voicepack ready in .pkg format (although unsure if this package is meant for my Vacuum(its the Glados Package)), i also have all the Files separate. I have full root access to the vacuum via SSH if that helps any. Im fine with just placing the files via terminal but i guess it doesnt work that way. I couldnt find instructions specific to the S5 Max only for different Models. I suspect lacking OTA capabilities are part of the problem. Really could need some assistance.

Thanks in advance"
"Can the S5 run with the suction fan disconnected?I want to use an S5 as a general lidar-capable robot for a project.

"New S5 Max dissapointingHey all, I’m hoping to get some feedback and help on how to help use this thing and get a good map set up.
House is all on one level, with one big floor rug that it keeps getting stuck on. When it doesn’t, it spent almost 45min JUST on the rug, and kept going over the same areas, completely neglecting the rest of the house which it didn’t even get around to mapping before the battery ran out and had to dock. Then when we resumed it later, it deleted the map it had made so far anyway even though I’ve turned on the “beta” option to save. I also tried to add a no-go zone to cover the area rug that it obsessed over and got stuck 3 times, and now when it gets near it, it errors out and I have to MANUALLY move it away?? It doesn’t have the capability to turn away and go somewhere else? Is that not what should happen?

As far as I assume, you would need to do a full house clean to build a proper map, then lay out no go zones, room designations and all that to refine it. Is this not correct? 

As it’s going now I’m pretty close to returning this thing."

"S7 Max V Ultra vs. Max V Plus (bagless?)?Hey everyone,

I'm sure this type of thing has been asked a bunch but I can't seem to make up my mind on what kind of vacuum I want to get. I have done a bunch of research on the Max V Ultra and it seems pretty awesome aside from the hefty price tag... one thing that I really hate though is having to buy bags. I'd love a bagless version and I think I would buy it instantly if it had that. Does anyone know if it will be possible to swap the bag in the Ultra dock for a bagless bin in the future? From what I've found, no information pointing to that so far.

Interested in hearing your thoughts about the Max V Ultra in general as well. We have a really dusty house in a really dusty neighborhood so the mopping capabilities seem very nice to have, but again I'm not sure if its worth all of the extra money.

Thanks!"
"best price quality robot vacuum cleaner for my apartmenti need to buy a robot vacuum cleaner for my new apartment which is 115 m2. my apartment has several low and medium pile carpets and I don't have pets.

I've been looking at the new Xiaomi Mop 2S which looks like a very capable vacuum cleaner and is price-quality ($200).

However I question if it is worth the extra effort for the roborock s7 (460$). The advantages of the S7 are carpet detection to increase suction, lift the mop, and better clean with mop vibration.

I've heard that the s7 leaves a lot of mop streaks.

"S4 max, new’ish user, any high threshold tricks?Pretty much title: Just switched from Roomba to Roborock S4max. Very happy with it, but I have a high threshold into my kitchen. It’s made it in there before when I did a manual zone clean, but it doesn’t consistently make it and it never makes it during regularly scheduled cleans (yes, the kitchen is set up to be included). I know it’s capable, but not sure how to ‘encourage’ it to try harder. Anyone have ideas?

Additional info: The kitchen floor is cork and I installed it and built the transition myself. I could knock the squared shoulder off, but it would still be the same height. Would just go from 90 degree shoulder to a 45 degree, for example. The transition from one floor to the other is about 3/4 of an inch. 

Thanks, in advance, for any help/suggestions!"
"French Review of the S7 MaxV Ultra[Here's the original, click for pictures](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/roborock-s7-max-v-ultra-p66755/test.html)

Google translated:

 **Roborock's S7 MaxV Ultra prides itself on being one of the most autonomous robots on the market.** **Delivered with an imposing base comprising three bins, it vacuums, washes, empties its collector and automatically cleans its mop.**

## Presentation

The S7 MaxV Ultra is a hybrid robot vacuum for vacuuming and mopping the floor. Even better, Roborock presents it as an almost autonomous device. Sold at €1399, it is the “ultra” of the range which, delivered with a charging station, relieves the user of less than stellar tasks. Composed of three bins, the base empties the waste collector, fills the robot's water tank if necessary and keeps the soiled one after cleaning. Originality of the product, this station is automatically responsible for washing its tray and mop. And to achieve unparalleled cleaning performance, the manufacturer has equipped its robot with sensors, a rangefinder, a camera, a 3D scanner and a mop with sonic vibrations.

&#x200B;

 

## Convenience of use (5 stars)

Roborock's latest has a futuristic look. Dressed in black and red, it measures less than 10 cm in height. Above all, the S7 MaxV Ultra is a compendium of technologies, and it shows! It is thus equipped with ReactiveAI 2.0 technology combining an RGB camera and a 3D scan. This would allow the robot to find its way around its environment and detect obstacles in its path. Its laser rangefinder helps it correctly map the environment and optimize the route. Finally, the S7 MaxV Ultra obviously has an armada of sensors to detect different types of surface, obstacles or prevent it from falling into the void in the presence of a staircase, for example. Thanks to these technologies, the navigation of the robot should be among the best.

 If Roborock communicates a lot about these many technologies, the charging station remains the major asset of the S7 MaxV Ultra; imposing with its 49 cm in height and 42 cm in depth and width. It thus makes it possible to minimize the maintenance carried out by the user. To do this, it carries three different bins. Two are intended for the washing function: one must be filled with clean water, while the second collects dirty water after washing.

 Concretely, the base automatically fills the water tank integrated into the robot (200 ml), wrings the mop during and after washing, then stores the soiled water in the second tank. If the [Yeedi Mop Station](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/robot-laveur-sol/yeedi-mop-station-p64729/test.html) and the [Dreame Bot W10](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/robot-laveur-sol/dreame-w10-p67407/test.html) also have bins of this type, they do not have a collector drain container. The base of Roborock – and this is the originality of the robot – is equipped with it. It is therefore no longer necessary to get your hands dirty to empty the collector. But the manufacturer does not stop there and has equipped the S7 MaxV Ultra with an automatic self-cleaning system on its base after a session.

Continuing around the owner, we spot the waste collector under the carcass of the S7 MaxV. With a capacity of 400 ml, it has a HEPA filter that traps small dust and thus reduces the risk of allergy or asthma. A large rubber brush and a small side brush, combined with a suction power of 5100 Pa, are responsible for sucking up waste and dust.

 The mop attaches under the robot and goes into the washing machine. As for the water tank, it is clipped to the back and it allows you to moisten the vibrating mop.

 Finally, we identify the control panel located on the cover of the robot. Very classic, it allows you to start a cleaning, pause it, send the S7 MaxV back to its base or ask it to undertake a targeted cleaning.

 

### Connectivity and app

The Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra pairs easily with the app. After searching for the device on the latter, a QR Code appears and must be flashed by the robot's camera: it connects to wifi and becomes operational.

The user is then offered a plethora of functionalities. Of course, it is possible to ask the robot to start cleaning, to pause it or to return to its base. The mop's suction and “rubbing” intensities can be adjusted according to the chosen mode: vacuuming and washing, vacuuming or washing. As with many robot vacuums, the Roborock app allows you to create virtual walls, no-go zones, cleaning zones and even customize rooms from A to Z. In short, the user is king.

The possible settings are so numerous that it is difficult to detail them all. The user can choose how often the mop is washed, enable or disable automatic bin emptying, or schedule sessions. The multi-stage option is also available and is very valuable.

As with the [Samsung Jetbot AI+](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/samsung-jet-bot-ai-vr50t95735w-wa-p65705/test.html) , the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra's on-board camera lets the user see what's going on at home. It is then possible to follow a cleaning in progress, to control the robot remotely using a remote control and even to call the robot! The user can then communicate with people nearby or with his pet.

The app provides a very complete experience, especially since the details of the mapping are really appreciable: the robot identifies the obstacles (an icon identifies them on the map), the different surfaces (such as carpets) and grays out the clusters of waste (such as our sawdust).

## Maintenance (4 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra's docking station is supposed to be very self-contained, but the facts diverge somewhat. First of all, we noticed that the automatic draining of the collector was far from efficient. After initiating our cleaning session, the robot returns to its base, which in turn sucks up the collected waste. We then manipulated the robot and noticed that waste was escaping from the collector. To find out for sure, we placed 150 g of rice in the belly of the device, then ordered to empty its collector automatically. Only 26.3 g of rice were sucked up… We repeated the operation with 50 g of sawdust this time. The results are then better, but unequivocally: only 30 g were recovered by the suction base.

The automatic mop cleaning is also somewhat disappointing. During cleaning and at the end of the cycle, the base of the Roborock takes care of cleaning the mop thanks to an integrated brush. Alas, the results remain mixed and we prefer to put the wipe in the washing machine for more efficiency (60°C for a perfect result).

In the same way, the base is supposed to clean itself, always using the brush. Despite this feature, we find the base plate very dirty after cleaning. In question, the many interstices present on the base.

The HEPA filter retains little dust. We weighed before/after sucking 20 g of cocoa. In the end, only 0.2g got into the filter.

We should also point out the efficiency of the automatic filling of the water tank integrated into the robot. Thanks to its clean water tank, the base fills it as soon as necessary, which allows the S7 MaxV Ultra to gain autonomy.

Finally, the rubber brush avoids the entanglement of hair and hair, knowing that a small tool is delivered with the robot to improve maintenance.

## Navigation system (4 stars)

As we have previously reported, the S7 MaxV Ultra is a compendium of technologies. Its sensors, its laser rangefinder and its pair of cameras should allow it to locate itself perfectly in any type of environment.

 We therefore wanted to verify Roborock's claims and scattered 100 g of sawdust in strategic places in our laboratory. The trajectory of the robot is strange: it sometimes cuts the room in two, sometimes lingers on the carpet. Either way, it circles the area first before zigzagging around.

Then comes the first difficulty: our fine carpet. It's a success: the robot passes over the carpet without difficulty and does not forget to raise its mop to avoid soaking it. Ditto, the chair bars are not obstacles for the S7 MaxV Ultra. On the other hand, it bypasses the curtains without going under them and considers them as walls.

We then decide to place objects in its path to observe its behavior. The S7 MaxV Ultra would indeed be able to recognize shoes, cables and even animal feces. Above all, the manufacturer ensures that his machine reacts differently according to what he perceives. The robot vacuum cleaner would approach shoes, but stay away from excrement, for example. Obviously, we did not carry out this test, but placed a water bottle, a tea towel and a power cable. Apart from the water bottle, the robot dragged the obstacles in its path, which is a bit disappointing given the promise.

Finally, we place the robot in the dark. A front light comes on to light the way. Its route is quite methodical, but the robot seems to take detours from time to time and sometimes finds itself in difficulty in the face of certain obstacles.

## Suction (4 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra has a suction power of 5100 Pa (pascals), a wide brush and a side brush. This trio gives hope for more than adequate suction performance. This was the case on hard ground and fine carpet, in boost or normal mode.

On thick carpet, however, the test thickens. The device manages to collect 70% of the scattered rice in normal mode and 72% in boost mode. If this coating is particularly difficult for robot vacuum cleaners, this Roborock does not stand out on this test. For comparison, the [Dreame L10 Pro](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/dreame-l10-pro-p64593/test.html) , one of the last tested by *Les Numériques* , had sucked up 82% of the waste.

We tested the S7 MaxV Ultra as a robot vacuum, not a floor scrubber. The procedure therefore does not include washing efficiency. However, Roborock's strong communication around the versatility of the device prompted us to double down on our testing. Find the results in the news lab link.

## Autonomy (5 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra ranks in the middle of our [comparison](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/comparatif-choisir-meilleur-aspirateur-robot-a1555.html) and requires just over 3 hours to fully recharge. In standard mode, the robot is placed in the high average and vacuums for 2 h 51 min. It is also one of the longest-lasting devices in boost mode since it cleans for 1 hour 40 minutes.

## Noise (2 stars)

If it does not break the ears, the robot is not the quietest. In standard mode, it reaches 62 dB (A) against 54 dB (A) for the [iRobot Roomba J7+](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/irobot-roomba-j7-p64987/test.html) . The robot vacuum even goes up to 66 dB (A) when set to its maximum power.  

## STRONG POINTS

* Good suction performance.
* Quick recharge time.
* Good autonomy.
* Full app.
* Automatic filling of the water tank integrated into the robot.

## WEAK POINTS

* Improving obstacle management.
* Sloppy 2-in-1 features.

 

Conclusion (5 stars):

**The S7 MaxV Ultra is presented by Roborock as a hybrid device capable of vacuuming, washing and automatically managing its maintenance.** **However, if the suction performance is more than correct, there is a downside.** **The docking station is indeed very messy and does not manage to clean itself, whether at the level of its base, its mop or concerning the emptying of the collector.** **The vibrating mop, it (and like on many other devices), is only figurative.** **The S7 MaxV Ultra is certainly an excellent vacuum cleaner, but seems to rush its other features.** **It is therefore far from being considered a 2-in-1 robot worthy of the name.**"

"Need help choosing a model!I've been looking for a Roborock vacuum cleaner and stopped on two models -   


S5 Max  
S6 MaxV(around 70 euros more expensive)  


From my research, both should be good, but I'd rather ask people who actually use those just to make sure. I have two concerns:   


1) I have a cat(Scottish Fold, hair fairly short), it shouldn't be a problem, right?  
2) What I'm mostly concerned about - Most of my rooms are separated with a frame/ramp or however you call it, depending on the room it can go up to 3cm tall or so. Are those robots capable of climbing those?  


Other than that, I have a carpet almost in every room except for kitchen, so there's a lot of places where the robot should go from the floor onto a carpet. So any recommendations are very much appreciated!"

For the past week I have been reading extensive reviews on robot vacuum cleaners since I want to purchase my first one. 
Up until now I have been very skeptical but have decided to give it a shot. 

Is S5 Max still worth getting for me to enter the robot vacuum world? 
The mopping functionality is not crucial for me and neither is the docking station capability, in this scenario the most valuable is S5 Max if I have understood it correctly? Any input is appreciated. 

S5M costs me about $400, and S7 about $600…."
"Roborock Dyad US release date?Hey everyone, I'm really interested in the roborock Dyad due to the self cleaning capabilities and I was wondering if anyone knows what the release date will be in the US? I don't see any indication or purchase link on the site so maybe I'm missing something or no one knows yet.

Edit: Support says it'll be released on Amazon and US site on February 10th."
"Roborock T7sThe T7S series is a newly designed sweeping and mopping unit with automatic dust collection. The T7S has a new carpet recognition sensor on top of the existing sensor on the bottom of the T7S, which sends out ultrasonic waves to accurately identify carpets and floors, and to control the lift of the mopping unit (up to 5mm above the floor) according to the current working conditions. At the bottom of the T7S, where the vibrating mop holder is mounted, there is an additional metal rod assembly which drives the vibrating area of the mop to swing left and right to wipe the floor, with a high frequency vibration of 3000 vibrations per minute achieved by the high performance brushless motor, easily dismantling stubborn dirt on the floor. Another major upgrade to the Stone T7S is the new design of the main brush module. The main brush is now a flexible TPU brush with 5 long and 5 short brushes to ensure the best possible air pressure and dust removal. In addition, it reduces the problem of static electricity when cleaning carpets. The dust collection station has been upgraded from the secondary 9-cone cyclone separation on the stone handheld hoover to a larger 15-cone cyclone for efficient separation without loss and is certified by the TÜV Rheinland for no loss of suction power. In addition, the dust collector has a triple separation filtration system with cyclone separation, pre-filter and HEPA filter of class H13, resulting in clean exhaust air and avoiding secondary pollution of the vacuum equipment. It is worth mentioning that this dust collector is currently the only one on the market that can achieve H13 air purifier level filtration. Finally, as for the T7S series purchase advice, the T7S and T7S Plus have the same basic functions, the same sweeping and mopping capabilities, the T7S Plus has an additional Reactive 3D structured light obstacle avoidance system, which is more capable of avoiding small objects such as toys and messy cables. For those with less clutter on the floor and no pets or babies, the more cost-effective Stone sweeper and mopper T7S is recommended.

"Docking after cleaning a different floor is frustrating.We’ve got two floors and two maps. After cleaning the floor with no dock, we place the robot on the main floor and can do one of two things:

1.	Press the Home button and watch the robot ~~establish its position and head to the dock~~ wander around aimlessly for over 30 minutes, creating multiple new maps, covering the same ground several times, and eventually stumbling into the dock.
2.	Press the Power/clean button, watch the robot spin around in place **once** and successfully establish its position, then use the app to cancel the clean and send it to the dock.

I’d love it if you could tell me I’m doing it wrong. It’s the 6 Pure, if that matters. 

**Edit**: Current firmware version is installed (3.5.8_1278)

**Edit 2**: It looks like we all have similar experiences, since I'm seeing a lot of ""tricks"" or workarounds for something that, ideally, should be push-button (they clearly are capable of quickly establishing their location, as they do when we push the button to get them to clean. They just don't do so when we tell them to dock). Thanks for the input!"
"S6 MaxV - No Mop Zone for Carpeted Rooms?Our robot has mapped the house, didn’t pick up that two rooms were carpeted, but we placed a manual no mop zone over them. 

I filled the water tank and attached the mop, then asked it to run a full clean. It did the whole house but avoided the carpeted rooms and then said the clean was complete! 

So I asked it to do those specific rooms and it would leave the dock but immediately return saying “clean up failed, unable to reach the location”. 

I deleted the no mop zones and then tried again and it went into the carpeted room…. But the mop itself seemed to be moving around and folding back on itself etc. 

What is the solution here? Am I really meant to detach the mop manually and run two seperate cleans? Does it not have the capability to clean the whole house in one go regardless of the surface type? 

Thanks!"
"Returning S6MaxV (multiple issues)I wanted to like this robot so badly! I did a ton of research to decide what to update my Roomba 690 to. 


reasons for returning:


1.The biggest issue is that the robot detects a electromagnetic field in the MIDDLE of my dining room and as a result refuses to clean there. Support said over email that I should return my unit even though the answer seems simple (turn off magnetic no go line detection with an app toggle). 


2 The side brush is incredibly dumb in execution. When the robot goes on my higher pile carpet the main brush works fine but the side brush always gets tangled. The robot doesn't seem to know to reverse the rotation direction of the side brush to get free like my 4 year old Roomba does...(again...simple software update). 

3.I had to put white pieces of paper tapped to all the cliff sensors just to get my robot to go up on the rug. (another thing that can be turned off with a software toggle). 

4.It relies TOO MUCH on LIDAR without doing false positive checks with the bump sensor. What I mean by this is if it accidentally goes under a drapery or shower curtain then it shuts down and yells at you in the app that it can't see. (again, simple software fix to have it try and go back to the last known position by backing up or driving forward) 


As a software engineer in the medical field this just seems lazy in programming design. Specially for the amount of iterations this company has done to get up to this model. 


I'm going to try out the Ecovac's T8 AIVI and see if that's better. Really sad though given that their unit doesn't have a IR camera.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/15/2020)

I have received my Ecovac T8+ from Bestbuy. Got it set up, fully charged, ran a whole house clean. Here are my initial thoughts in comparison to the Roborock S6MaxV below.


1. It immediately was able to overcome the area with the high electromagnetic frequency. No issues what so ever. It held it's straight line pattern and was done super quickly. 

2. It had the same issue initially as the Roborock where it refused to go up onto my higher pile carpet. I took all the white tapped paper off of my S6MaxV and taped them onto the bottom of the T8. This solved that issue just like the Roborock. I say initially because once I solved the climbing onto the carpet issue it had NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER at cleaning the high pile carpet. Now _note_ this robot has TWO side cleaning brushes and neither got stuck in the 20 minutes I ran it on my high pile carpet, amazing. I still hate having to put tape over an $800 device, but at least it doesn't get tangled once up on the carpet.

3. It cleaned up my apartment in about the same time as the Roborock but did it in a different style. It split the rooms in half and would do half a room, then leave and do another room, then come back. I was worried at first because that seems inefficient, however on completion of the map generation, it merged / separated the rooms correctly and so now I can tell it to clean a specific room. 


4. Carpet detection is amazing! I didn't have to put ANY no go lines in my place vs the Roborock where I had to put some on the carpet as well as by the night stands where cables lay around and the cat bowls. 

5. Avoided the cat bowls. Got up super close but then recognized an object in the way, backed up, and cleaned around them. The Roborock would either not get close to them on some passes or would completely shove them out of the way. (granted the cat bowls are around the area that the Roborock yells about the EMFs). 


6. Seemed to pull much more out of my medium pile carpet. I don't know if that's from the rumors of Roborock's main brush overheating management or just something else. After running it just once there was so much in the dustbin that I had to clean it out by hand because the self cleaning couldn't do it. (This is known issue with self cleaning robots that you need to run them move often to avoid clogs). I JUST ran my S6MaxV last night on that carpet so seems better in that regard. 

------ISSUES SO FAR-----------
-only issues i've had so far in the app was splitting rooms in the app. Merging was SUPER easy but the splitting algorithm seems to want splits along existing walls. For instance I wanted to isolate the area in front of the cat's litter box to a room so I can tell it to clean that area specifically. The first split of the main room was fine but the perpendicular split wouldn't take. I ended up doing an angled single split instead which get 80% of the area I had intended. Will try and get that working better though. From my research this is the biggest issue with Ecovacs. 

-Since I had taped over the cliff sensors to get onto the high pile rug, it caused an issue where the auto empty station wouldn't start up at the end of a clean even though it said it was in the app. Removing the tape covers fixed it. I guess i'll have to come up with a better solution to get it onto the high pile rug but at least i know once it gets on the rug it will be okay. 

All in all I'm much happier with the T8+ so far. It tackled my two main issues ( high pile carpet cleaning and EMF areas) which staying about 99% on par with my S6MaxV. 

I will continue to update this thread throughout the week with further updates since I have until the end of the month to send either unit back for a refund. 







-------EDIT 09/16/2020--------


THINGS I LOVE!
Okay so this was freaking awesome. I remembered reading that the new T8's 3D object detection tech is using two cross shooting IR lights with a center mounted IR sensor.


 I have security cameras in my apartment that turn on when we aren't home since my apartment has a clause in our lease that says maintenance can come in at any time due to emergencies without advanced notice, which they have before . Just helps me keep at ease. Anyway at night they switch to IR mode and I was able to check out the IR from the T8 working in real time! I would also guess that night time might be _easier_ for the robot to navigate/ see in my apartment when the cameras are on because of all the IR light they project out. 


Here is what that looks like in the camera view 
[camera picture](https://imgur.com/a/myiMKrD)
I can't be sure, but it looks to have two side IR lights as well, perpendicular to the front of the robot. The object detection still is better than the S6MaxV. It's getting closer to my cat's water and food bowl to clean but won't run into the like the Max did. The Max always pushed them off the cat mat; maybe because the bowls are too reflective, idk. 


The self empty base station is awesome. A bit loud but only runs for 20 seconds a day and seems powerful enough to clean the filter.I was worried about that since a dirty filter after an empty would just make the robot's suction decrease the next run. 


Navigation has been great! It seems to improve every run and is going under all the chairs my Roborock would get too nervous about going through. 



-----------ISSUES SO FAR-------------
So i've had a few more software issues but again nothing game changing. After removing the cliff sensors so that the robot works with the self empty base station, it again wasn't able to go on my high pile carpet. I picked up the robot and put it on the carpet then told it to run. I then looked at the map and saw it was CREATING A NEW MAP and I couldn't see my old map. Had some slight uneasy feeling that I would need to remap my whole apartment again. I went into the map settings and tried enabling multifloor map saving. THIS WORKED! I immediately found my original map of my whole apartment and loaded that back up. 


For the time being i'm going to place my robot on the area rug and have it create a new map for just the rug until I work out a way to tape or press down the edges of my pile carpet so the vacuum can do the whole apartment in one run. Again, not a deal breaker by any means because it's still able to vacuum the high pile carpet once its on it and doesn't have EMF issues.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/17/2020)


-------The Good----------


I was asked by u/fishy6868 to run some comparison tests on the mopping functionality of both robots. 

firstly here is a picture of both pads and pad velcro plates. [Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/rBuCxpe)


[Second Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/OcVvd13)


You can see from the photos that the Roborock pad is about 10-15% larger than the Ecovac pad. 

I let the T8 mop my whole apartment (besides the carpets) and then compared the results to my S6 tests. I ran both robots on max water level with only one pass in each room. 


Both robots seem to mob about the same which is to say they aren't amazing, but the do a decent job in maintaining your floors for day to day. I personally mop because cat litter likes to stick to the wood floor which has a hard time being picked up by both robot's brushes. Each mop pad was similar in dirtiness when can on different days though I noticed the Roborock, despite a bigger pad, likes to get a lot of the dirt in more of the middle part of the pad. 


Some things I noticed in comparing the pads is difference in methodology between companies. What I mean by this is that the Roborock has a bigger pad but it's much thinner. I think this is because of the tighter tolerance between the mopping pad and the floor when the mopping pad is installed on the Roborock. 


The Ecovac has a MUCH thicker pad but there seems to be more play between the floor and the pad when the pad is installed which seems to be for angular adjustment of the mopping pad as it goes up and down different grades of surfaces. 


All in all I'm satisfied with the mopping capability of the T8 and don't see it as a driving factor in deciding between either robot. If the differences were drastic I might have more trouble deciding but since the difference is negligible then I'm fine with either if given the choice.  


The navigation keeps getting better. I HAVE YET TO PUT A SINGLE NO GO ZONE OR NO MOP ZONE IN MY MAP. It's amazing because with the Roborock I had to put a lot of them (by the nightstands where cables lay, by the cat bowl it never avoided, around the high pile rug that it would always error out on,etc). Simply amazing. It also has gotten smarter about going under my chairs which the Roborock never did because it never was confident enough to.




Haven't had simple map issue since I turned on multi floor mapping. 


-----The bad------


Okay so I took the cliff sensor tape off of all the sensors the other day when I found that they were interfering with the auto empty function from actually working for some reason. After removing these sensors the T8 is able to still get up onto my high pile carpet rug, but it has trouble with navigation once on it (probably from the sensors going on and off about different distances to the floor). I does a lot of side to side motions when trying to go in straight lines (like the guy who posted about his Roborock acting drunk). This doesn't seem to be a deal breaker for me though as much as it was for the Roborock because at least the T8 can clean 100% of my wood floor. The S6 didn't do that because of the EMF issue. Also, the T8 never spits out any errors or stops cleaning which the S6 would do a lot if I put it on that carpet.. 



Maybe down the road i'll figure out how to get it to be more reliable in navigation on the high pile rug. Again though, at least it can get up on the rug and doesn't error out when attempting to clean it. After a few days I am strongly leaning towards keeping the T8 and returning the S6MaxV since i'm not having any major issues.






-------UPDATE 09/19/2020----------

So I've decided that i've done enough testing; I'm returning the Roborock S6MaxV. The T8 is just much better fitting for my needs and has better avoidance. I also hooked it up to Alexa and I can confirm that it allows me to tell it to clean specific rooms or areas with my voice which is something I had wished the Roborock would be able to do. 


I contacted Ecovac support about issues with splitting rooms and they confirmed my theory which is that you can't split a virtually split room. You can only split along walls the LIDAR has confirmed. while that is a bummer, it's not a deal breaker and they said they aim to improve this in the future. I was still able to split 90% of the rooms the way I wanted perfectly. 


Still think that the T8 picks up more hair on carpet than the Roborock. Each day I run it on my medium pile carpeted bedroom and it fills up half the bin where the S6MaxV only filled MAYBE 1/4th. Also when I run my regular standing vacuum after a cleaning run with the T8 I get less in the bin in conparison.  


Navigation still isn't as perfect as the Roborock (it sometimes does little circles but maybe that's it trying to avoid stuff or navigate) but it's 90% cose to the Roborocks so the pros out weight any negatives in that regard. 


I will say though I'm going to miss the active community this sub has. Ecovacs has posts that are weeks old...


Hope this helps anyone trying to decide what's best for their home! Maybe in a few weeks when I get more data i'll add more information if anything changes but day to day everything has been great so seems pointless to still do daily updates. 


Cheers!


P.S It seems VacuumWars on Youtube gave the T8 a top pick over the S6MaxV for premium robot vacuum. Seems for Roborock you're better off going with the S5Max instead for the price to value. I think the S6MaxV is way overpriced at $750 currently."
"S6 vs. S5 vs. S4Hey everyone,

My wife and I are looking at getting one of these for our house and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding on which to get. I was almost sold on the S5 until I was comparing the specs and noticed that the S4 is basically the same as the S5 minus the ability to mop (which I've heard is meh at best) and lack of top-up charge. It seems the S4 also has the capability for the adaptive route algorithm where as the S5 does not. Considering it's a difference of $160 ($320 vs. $480), the S4 seems like the better choice unless I'm missing something.

All that being said, initially the S6 wasn't on my horizon as I wasn't looking to pay $600 before taxes. But in all of this search, I stumbled upon a code on Amazon that brings the S6 down to $450.

S4 - $320

S5 - $480

S6 - $450

Looking at these prices, what are y'alls thoughts? Is the S6 basically just a better version in all aspects compared to the other two? I've heard such great things about the S5 in many many posts but with the S6 being newer (and usually more expensive) I haven't heard as much.

I appreciate the input!"
"S5 Max or Dreame L10 Pro?I'm aware this is a Roborock forum and prepared for abit of biased opinion .. 😂

Thinking of getting the S5 Max but essentially is it getting on abit now as it's 2-3 years old? I understand it's still highly capable and beats alot of the more expensive ones but for the same money can get something like the Dreame L10 Pro. Is it still worth it in that price range ?"
"Should i get the S7 or the S6 MaxVHave used Neato and Roomba in the past, Roborock will be my 4th vacuum.

The S6 MaxV has the AI capability with a dual camera, and the S7 has the LIDAR, which one of these works better for obstacle avoidance? I have a kid who loves to leave toys around the house.

However, the most important function we are looking for in a robot vacuum is that we have both the carpet, hardwood floor, and ceramic tiles all on the same floor, so we definitely want a vacuum that can mop the tiles and hardwood floor and vacuum the carpets as well. The carpets are pretty dense, and i was wondering if the S7 does a good job on the carpets?

Please guide."
"360 S10 vs Roborock S6 MaxVGreetings All,

Our home pretty much has toys and lego blocks scatter on the floor as we have got young children.

I have been eyeing on the Roborock S6 MaxV since its release last year due to its AI computer vision capability.

I done extensive research on it and it seems that the MaxV not only has blind spots, its computer vision navigation capability isn't that reliable.

The new 360 S10 uses 3 LIDARs. 1 x front mounted long range for general navigation, 1 x front mounted short range to detect objects as small as 1cm, and a side mounted Lidar to reduce blind spots.

Would you go for the S10 or MaxV?

TIA!"
"E4 vs S4 — would I miss LIDAR?For a ~1000 sq ft one bedroom apartment, how much do you think the LIDAR navigation/mapping feature would be missed?  It looks like the E4 does have mapping capability to a certain degree... is that good enough to ensure good coverage and the ability to go from room to room?"
"New robot - S7 vs S5maxHi all,

I live in a 3 floor house. Currently I have a roborock S5 which has already some years. It does not work as smooth as the first day though, I have noticed that it does not catch all the dust as good. 

I have decided that I am gonna move the S5 to the second floor and buy a new one for the bottom one. But I am not quite sure about which to buy. I have read in general here that the recommendation is to go for the S5max. Best quality/price. However the new S7 with the possibility of using the auto-emptying dock (dont know the technical name) looks appealing to me. 

Two things worth mentioning. I have a dog which losses A LOT of hair. Moreover, this hair is kind of short and sharp/pointed which sticks a lot to a level loop pile carpet that I have in the living room. The fact that it can properly vacuum  is important. 

I have barely used the mop function of the S5, simply because I found it not very good. I could use it if I see that it works better / its worth but its not something I fully need. 

It also would be nice to have the capability to vacuum in a cross pattern. I do not know if thats implemented in all the versions but its something I dont have in the S5 and I miss to make sure everything is well clean."
"Best RoboRock for medium-high pile carpetApologies if this has already been addressed...but...

I recently made the decision to buy an S4. It's *amazing* on hardwoods and low-pile carpet (most of my downstairs) but I've noticed that it performs HORRIBLY (constant errors/getting confused/stuck) on the 1 room downstairs with medium-high pile carpet. I can live with manually cleaning this one room (that never gets used really) but I'm also looking to purchase a 2nd RoboRock to be used upstairs... which is *ALL* carpet. So my question: Is there a RoboRock model that's better suited for medium-high pile carpeting? I've got no interest in mopping capability and would prefer to keep Lidar mapping.

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks!"
"Looking to replace my EufyHi all!

A couple years ago, I purchased a Eufy 11 and last year got the 15C. I'm disappointed with how both models quickly declined in quality and incessantly beeped over every little thing (MOST of the time it was invisible things). I shouldn't have to take apart a $200+ device to get it to work.

So I started digging around, looking into dropping money on an actual Roomba, when I found out about the Roborock. But there are so many models to pick from that I have no idea where to get started.

Here are my criteria:

* Under $300-ish
* Doesn't beep incessantly for no apparent reason
* Mopping not required
* STRONG suction
* Able to clean a 1000 sq ft space
* Connectivity to Alexa or Android app
* Spot cleaning capability

I think that's all I've got! I only need to use it on the 1st floor of my apartment, which is an open floor containing my living room (low carpet) and kitchen (wood). All of my furniture has tall legs, so no issues with robots getting stuck under things. I have rabbits and I really depend on my robovacs to help me suck up stray poops and other debris in between full vacuuming with my stand-up vacuum.

Thanks in advance for the suggestions. I'd rather get some real input because I'm a little burnt out from trying robot vacuums that don't work."
"How does roborock work with Alexa?I have an s5 max coming next week and it’s my first. What capabilities are there? 

Is it as simple as “Alexa clean the kitchen” and it starts that map? Or more/less sophisticated than that?"
"Roomba Owner Seeking Change. Browsed for a bit...help me decide what model to buy?Four years ago I bought a Roomba 650. It was okay at the time, but I'm just not impressed with it. The random navigation and just bumping around all over the place doesn't really do it for me anymore so I'm looking for something different. I've been browsing the sub and watching YouTube videos and I'm pretty impressed with the Roborock line of products, I'd like to purchase one but there are so many models.

&#x200B;

My situation: I have a 2000 square foot home with about half and half carpet and wood. Only one person lives in the home and I have a cat that sheds. I don't mop....ever...just spot clean if there's a spill, so the mopping capability would be nice (even though I know it's just dragging a wet pad across the floor, it's better than nothing) and I vacuum once a week. I'd love to be able to set schedules (on Mondays do the living room, Tuesday den, etc)

&#x200B;

Would something like the S5 Max be for me? I see it has a coupon on Amazon for $50 off....is this the cheapest I could get it ($549)? If I do order through Amazon, would it be worth getting one of the purchase protection plans? 

&#x200B;

Sorry for so many questions. It's just a big purchase."
"S6 MaxV suction powerReally enjoying the mapping and AI capabilities of this unit but the suction power is a bit lacking. Its been forever since I owned a robot vacuum so maybe there hasn't been that much progress. 

My main complaint is in my bedroom with relatively low pile carpet, it misses cat fur. Just a few of the pieces here and there but it's not like it's terribly heavy to pick up. It'll just roll over it.
I've tried doing the 3x pass in the bedroom and ensured that it's said to max power.

Anyone else experiencing similar? Does it help to have the water chamber filled with water even if I'm not mopping, just so it has more pressure against the rug?

I feel like the cause is the brush roller itself. Thr brush hair is so soft that it likely can't pull up debris that well when over carpet. Wish it was more rigid."
"Robot vacs with sunken rooms and thresholds (PHOTOS)I am new to robot vacs and bought an S4 on Prime Day but am thinking I might need to return/replace with something else. My question is whether a single vac with multi-floor support will best serve my needs, or whether I need multiple robots, or even an entirely different brand. The issues are:

1. SUNKEN ROOMS: My home has more than one sunken room. i.e., there is no door between the rooms, but there is a step down of a few inches. The robot could easily see one room from the other, but cannot navigate the step without being lifted. If I lift and ""help"" the robot over that step, will it continue to map that space as a single level that I can perhaps later divide into rooms or regions for targeted cleaning?
2. THRESHHOLDS: My home also has several thresholds: a barrier that's at least an inch high that separates one room from the other. The robot will have trouble getting over this. Can I ""help"" the robot do this for mapping purposes, then later divide the map into rooms for targeted cleaning?

If the above things aren't possible, then I'm afraid I would need to treat the home as 6 ""floors"" with multiple robots. Here are some photos for illustration:

[One of my sunken room issues](https://preview.redd.it/777l7s3g9pt51.jpg?width=1593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b7100f4b12d71b53979dcddd3cbc1488646a0113)

&#x200B;

[Here's another sunken room, this time it's 2 full steps down, but the robot can clearly see one space from the other](https://preview.redd.it/k380yebfapt51.jpg?width=1492&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7145d14cc94a0a29d4f1379c671a4b9ab06e841)

&#x200B;

[This threshold is too high for the Roborock to climb over on it's own](https://preview.redd.it/1x7nqwx9bpt51.jpg?width=1771&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=185d961578bebdb7bd816447595326d744d1b4f8)

[This threshold is a little lower but still a real fight for the Roborock. It takes like dozen or more attempts, which is noisy and disconcerting.](https://preview.redd.it/55fadsucbpt51.jpg?width=1735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=65fb8310794084ee74e9ed53aaf065e99669c218)

Thoughts? Again, I'm asking whether I can ""help"" the robot map these areas by lifting it, OR do I need to treat each area as another floor, OR did I choose the wrong brand of vac?

P.S. - I don't really want mopping capability. Just vacuuming.

THANK YOU ALL"
Roborock E4 MoppingI just purchased a Roborock E4.  The instruction manual says (optional) mopping.  Does this have a mopping capability?
"New user - few questions!Just got the S5 Max today and so far I'm really impressed; after a few minor teething issues (and a small amount of moving furniture) I managed to get a full scan of the ground floor of our house and now everything is pretty much working just great.

I have a couple of questions though, if anyone can help:

1 - I have a rug with quite a deep pile, so deep in fact that it triggers the bump sensor on the robot and it refuses to go on the rug, even though if it pushed a little harder it would get on the rug no issue. It actually inadvertently ended up on it whilst trying to clean around the couch so I know it's capable of getting up there. So the question is, is there a way to tell it to ignore the bump sensor for the area, or to detect that it's just a rug? I suppose the alternative is to put something down to act as a ramp, but I thought I'd ask before doing that.

2 - I haven't used the mop attachment yet, but I've seen people suggest that you can't use anything but water in the tank. Is that correct? And if so, is that because of the potentially corrosive effect to the electrical parts that deal with the water flow? As a solution to that, I'm guessing there would be no issue with me spraying areas on the floor that I wanted to use floor cleaner on prior to the robot mopping (say a stubborn stain or something) as the cleaner would only end up on the mop and not inside the tank?

I think thats it! Thanks in advance to anyone who answers!"
"Roborock T7 and Roborock T7 PRORoborock T7 and Roborock T7 PRO

 Yesterday (2.23), Roborock T7 was officially released in China. Huge upgrades have been made in maps, algorithms, and water tank cleaning capabilities.

"Help picking up a model (S6 MaxV vs S5 Max vs Mijia 1C) in MalaysiaHey everyone, i'm pretty new here. I'm looking to buy a new robot vacuum cleaner with the following features:
-  Carpet Vacuuming with hepa filter & strong suction (2500pa)
-  Good Mopping capabilities with electric water control
-  Mapping function with Real Time Tracking, Zoned Cleaning, No-Mop Zones & Multi Floor maps etc
-  Object recognition/AI Camera would be nice but is not a must

Feature comparison of the models:  [https://smartrobotreviews.com/comparisons/?compare=2727,2791,2685](https://smartrobotreviews.com/comparisons/?compare=2727,2791,2685)

Here in Malaysia, Roborock S6 MaxV can be bought at $482 while Roborock S5 Max & Xiaomi Mijia 1C are priced at $393 &  $204 respectively. Considering the prices, is worth it to go for S6 MaxV (retailed at $750) or perhaps S5 Max (retailed at $480) as its good enough for my usage? Or should I just settle for the budget model (Mijia 1C - retailed at $269) which imo gives the best bang for the bucks?

Thanks!"
"Is mopping tile effective?I have the model S6 that has the capability of mopping. We have a kitchen floor that is 12x12 ceramic tiles. I have never used the mopping feature because I figured the water in the spaces between the tiles, where the grout is, would not get mopped up. Has anyone had experience with this? Thanks!"
"2 S4s vs S4 Max (multi level home)Purchased an S4 a week ago. First robot vacuum ever and I love it! That said, I have a two story apartment/loft and debating buying another S4 for downstairs (more convenient; less cost effective) or the S4 Max for multi level capabilities (less convenient; more cost effective). 

Seems multi level for the S4 has been promised forever and isn’t actually coming. Any thoughts from long time owners on either approach?"
"Sourcing an s4 from New Zealand?Hi Roborock community - I'm so keen to buy an s4. I don't need the mopping capability of the s5/s6 and I appreciate the lower price point.

So a question for other APAC owners - where can I buy one? Alixpress seems to only have the s5/s6 in stock and Mi retailers in NZ seem to only stock the S5 at a (predictably) inflated price. Amazon currently isn't shipping to NZ.

I'm hesitant to use a US forwarding service because I know the box will be really heavy.

Any tips would be appreciated."
"Work Around for Multi-Passes on Room Cleaning!For everyone using the Roborock app, consider switching to the Mi Home App. Your saved map will transfer so don’t worry! This application is more comprehensive, allows the naming of rooms, and still has the multipass capability on room cleaning! Much better in terms of app stability as well!"
Alexa Roborock Plus skill commands? What can we do with this skill. Tried “Roborock clean kitchen” it started full house clean.
"S7 and Alexa voice commandsI have been trying to use Alexa to control my s7 and I found really frustrated that this is not working (at least not as expected). After adding the skill roborock plus to my Alexa I noticed that the voice commands only works when I manually launch the app on the device other wise Alexa doesn't know what I am talking about. 

But honestly if I have to open my phone to launch the app on my Alexa I am better off using the roborock app to click start cleaning 😅

Have any of you managed to get this working? (Ps I am relatively new to both devices (Alexa and roborock))"
"Alexa - MiHOME/Xioami - Q5+Hi, has any one have any luck pairing your Robo to Alexa using the MiHome app?

Unfortunately, The Roborock app no longer connects to my internet and sometimes my phone, and I found the work around with MiHome except that when I run the Alexa skill for the app it turns up empty on finding the device. (Had no problems pairing it with the roborock app prior to the disconnect).

I'm having issues with this Q5+ since the 2nd week after purchasing it disconnecting from the internet completely. Forcing me to hard reset the unit and re-pair over and over. Although I called it in after the 30 days of owning it, the company is letting me send it back under warranty and ""supposedly"" giving me a new unit (but not till after pulling hair out my head... they're not the easiest people to deal with over email.. Phone convos tend to ne a little better)."
Is voice command supposed to work right off the bat once the Alexa skill is installed? I had to write 2 custom commands for each room. Example - ask robo rock to vacuum the hallway. IOS - S7 Maxv

"Got my S7 a couple weeks ago and I love watching it drag its little wet mussy across my floorI posted here a few weeks ago asking for tips as I was waiting to receive not only my first mopping bot, but my first bot with LiDAR mapping. 

I’ve had the S7 for about two weeks now, and after upgrading from a bump-sensor, vacuum-only Eufy, I have to say how amazing this thing is.

First off, the vacuuming alone is worth it comparatively to my old robot. I have two dogs in a 500 sq ft studio (which is tile only), one of which is a German Shepard who sheds like crazy. On top of that, I live in Arizona on a dirt lot so it gets dusty very quickly. 

I run the S7 on vacuum only mode once a day and it sucks up everything. Unlike my Eufy, dog hair doesn’t get wrapped around the roller because of the rubber design. It does a better job sweeping than I do (probably says more about my sweeping skills). 

Onto the mopping, I love it. I have lighter floors and a lot of natural lighting, so streaks, grime or spills show up so easily. I’m kind of obsessive over cleanliness so I used to mop 3 to 4 times a week. Now I’m comfortable manually deep mopping once a week thanks to how good of a job this does. 

I run the mop once a day on Deep+ mode with medium scrubbing. I did notice a bit of streaking the first day, but once I split up my cleaning area into rooms to force it to go with the tile grain, I now notice no streaking.

I know I’ve read people have had their shortcomings with it, and it’s possible that a lot of my praise is due to the upgrade from a shitbot, but I’m super happy with my purchase so far."
"Alexa skill stopped working most commandsHi! My Roborock Plus skill with Alexa has always worked perfectly until recently.   
Now I can only ask Alexa to ""turn on / off"" Roborock. If I try like ""Alexa, ask Robo rock to return to the dock"" or any other command Alexa  will just do an error blip and go silent.  


Has anybody experienced that?"
"Looking for a repair shop for my s5My roborock s5 has been giving me an error 13 for the past year but the last week it has been happening more frequently. I don’t have warranty anymore and shipping plus repair costs to the company is too much. I live in the DC area and was wondering if anyone knows a repair shop that would be able to fix it. Google has not been helpful.

Update: I bought a motherboard from aliexpress and switched it out. That did not work. I bought a new dock from eBay since I don’t have the engineering skills to change the capacitor. One week and it has not thrown an error."
"Roborock S7, Alexa skillHello everyone,  


I am looking for an Alexa command to switch between the vacuuming/cleaning modes of the Roborock S7. Something to be integrated in an Alexa routine such as ""Alexa, vacuum the room"", as opposed to ""Alexa, mop/clean the room"". 

Does anyone know whether similar commands are available on the Roborock plus skill for Alexa?"
"Alexa skill questionFirst of all, I have a S4 Max with defined and  named rooms.  How do I specify a room to clean with the Alexa skill? It will only start a clean cycle of the whole floor. And which skill is right? I'm using ""robo rock plus"" which the reviews say has selective room mode. 

Also is there a way to tell it to clean a specific zone?"
Would the S7 Max Ultra V bought from the US work in the UK?I just bought one and brought it to the UK. I noticed on the packaging that the dock required 120V input while the standard in the UK is 230V. I haven't plugged it in yet because I am afraid it might cause a permanent damage. Has anyone faced a similar situation and knows what's the best way to make it work? returning it back isn't an option.
Alexa skill can’t linkAnyone else notice that they can’t link there account to the Alexa skill?! Just started happening to me tonight.
Using Roborock Routines from voice controlI see in my app I can create a cleaning routine with specific rooms and settings in the Roborock app but it doesn't seem like I can use Alexa voice commands to run those routines?  Or choose to run them as part of an Alexa routine?  It would be great to do this!  I hope to clean specific rooms when I go to bed at night and I am already running a command when I am in bed and it would be awesome to also start a routine without having to open the app on my phone!
"Finally managed to get Alexa to have Roborock clean, or do anything! Such a dumb reason that it wasn’t working before.I’ve had my Roborock S4 Max since May 2022 (so 8 months). Whenever I would say “Alexa, ask Roborock to start cleaning” she would say there is no device named Roborock or wouldn’t know what to do. I finally figured out that if I say “Alexa, ask robo……rock to start cleaning”, it works perfectly. I just have to put a huge pause in between robo and rock. The product is one word yet for some reason the skill is set to only recognize it if you say it as two words? If the app developers could fix this, that would be much appreciated."

"Do you use the Xiaomi Home app or the Roborock app?Do you guys use the Roborock app or the Xiaomi Home app? 

I discovered I could add the Roborock in the Xiaomi Home app when I got my Smartmi SmartFan 2S. 

They have some degree of difference between them. Remote viewing for example is limited in the Xiaomi Home app (no camera with remote control which is sad because the function is critical to manoeuvring the robot if you're not home).

(I would like to add that English is not my first language 😅)"
"Roborock S7 rooting/Valetudo tutorialHello,

there is little information on using Valetudo on the S7, so I am writing this tutorial. The main Valetudo dev does **not** recommend or officially support this device, so do not expect help or bother him with problems related to the S7!

**Update:** This has changed, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/v5zth2/problems_rooting_roborock_s7/j67lthu/?context=1)

**If you are not technically inclined, this is not for you**. But I have tested it and need to share this information - out of principle.

**Q/A**

* *What is this / Why would I do this?* -> Rooting means attaining full access to a device's operating system. It should be a matter of course the device's owner should have this, but IoT companies are anti-consumer. After rooting, [Valetudo](https://valetudo.cloud/) may be installed. It provides an interface similar to the official app, but constrained to the local network (or internet via VPN). The vacuum is now liberated from the internet/cloud, not sharing any (potentially sensitive) data with China and not requiring an account. Control or schedules will not break anymore when the cloud is down/blocked/hacked/discontinued/out of business/starts demanding a subscription/etc. Valetudo also enables integration with many home automation systems and allows custom voice packs. Lastly, it can be controlled with any device featuring a modern browser, not just phones.

* *Will the vacuum behave differently or navigate badly?* -> Nope. Valetudo replaces the ""cloud"" component, not the firmware on the device itself. It behaves as before.

* *Do I have to set everything up again?* -> Nope. Only schedules aka timers. The map is stored on the device and will still be the same after converting to Valetudo.

* *Can it be undone?* -> Yes. Install a firmware without the ""Patch DNS"" flag set.

* *How well does it work?* -> Great, in my experience! Contrary to [statements from Valetudo's main dev](https://erppc.net/~haarp/temp/Valetudo_Discussion_854.html), everything works. Plenty of RAM (>1/4) is left while Valetudo is running. ROM is near full, but that's no concern to an user. Some things are not (yet) configurable, but will still work: Carpet ignore zones, carpet handling with mop attached (raise mop/avoid/ignore) and showing carpets or mopping path on the map. Everything else is splendid. I have not, however, tested the auto-empty dock.

* *How much effort is it / will I succeed?* -> It's risky. You'll void the warranty. The robot needs to be disassembled down to the main board and a temporary wire needs to be added to flash a modified firmware. This is a lot of effort and can potentially damage the bot. Only recommended for those with experience tinkering with electronic devices and basic Linux/command line skills.  
It's also possible that [newer firmwares prevent rooting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/v5zth2/problems_rooting_roborock_s7/ibd0cac/), so beware. This is not yet fully confirmed tho. I can only confirm that firmware 02.14.44 was rootable. If someone attempts it on a newer firmware (such as the current 02.15.00), please report back. For the time being, avoid updating the firmware if you intend to root at any point. **Update**: See /u/dontvacuumme comment below

* *I want a fully-featured modern vacuum that's easier to root!* -> Get a Dreame L/Z10 (Pro) (but avoid updating the firmware on these too!). Also see [here](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html). For me, the reason for going with the S7 was the vibrating/rising mop.

* *What about the S7 MaxV?* -> Not a chance. There is no known rooting method and there likely never will be. The S7 non-MaxV may be the last Roborock bot to be rootable by mortal means. Luckily, second-hand devices and spare parts should continue to be available for a long time.


**Tutorial**

/u/dontvacuumme was the brilliant mind who came came up with the FEL rooting method. His howto can be found [here](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/howtos/nand/fel/_howto.html). A visual guide for disassembling the S7 is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGScpICKEbE).

I have a few comments, in *addition* to the howto above:

* I recommend fully charging the battery and setting the robot up with the official app first, so it connects to your Wi-Fi and you can note down its IP address. This is not strictly necessary however. Do **NOT** update the firmware!
* Be careful and gentle. If you need force, you're likely doing something wrong.
* There is a thin steel wire on the side holding the mop plate. It becomes visible once you start separating the main shell. Use tweezers to remove the small nipple at the end of this wire from its plastic housing before fully removing the shell.
* The vacuum needs to be disassembled down to the main board. The board can be removed from the robot, as it will still boot/connect to Wi-Fi with only the battery (and the little daughterboard) attached.
* See [here](https://i.imgur.com/j60PgGD.png) for the location of the pads that need to be shorted. They're on the underside of the board.
* The board has a conformal coating on it. Scrape it off (or solder) on both pads to make sure the wire actually makes electrical contact.
* If using Linux: Some distro's sunxi-tools packages install the `fel` command instead of `sunxi-fel`. Edit run.sh to remedy this.
* *""After it has been uploaded, wait 5 minutes. Your robot should restart when its done (look for turned off leds)""* <- also applies to Linux!
* *""Your robot should be reachable via SSH and your SSH key.""* <- the username is `root` (big surprise there).
* *""Continue the steps to install Valetudo (check the steps at the bottom of this document: S5E Cheatsheet)""* <- only the stuff after *""# this step activates valetudo""* is relevant.
* After these steps, navigate a browser towards the IP address of the robot to see the Valetudo interface.

Hope this helps somebody! Let me know if you have questions."
"Alexa Commands Just Stopped Working?Out of absolute nowhere, commands have just suddenly stopped working, and when I ask to clean certain rooms I'm getting 'The Skill Eufy Clean can help you with that.' WTAF?

I have routines setup too, where I can just say 'Clean the Hallway' and the routine will execute a 'Ask Robo Rock to clean the corridor' command - now that's just no-longer understood. Nothing has changed my end. I've enabled, re-enabled the skill etc, but nothing.

Anyone else experiencing this behaviour?

I'm UK based with an S7 MAX V using the Roborock Plus Alexa Skill."
"Roborock S5max Alexa SkillMy Alexa app is realy annoying with my s5max I cant charge him over a voice command, only starting roborock is possible ?

Do you have the same problems ?"
Alexa no long recognized commandsI have the s7 and it’s been amazing but lately (past few months) Alexa no longer understands commands. I have tried removing the skill and adding it again. She responds with “I don’t know how to set robotrock s7 to that setting”. I know this is likely an issue with Alexa and not the s7 but I figured this would be the appropriate place to ask since the issue is specific to the s7. Everything works from the app on my phone but all my Alexa’s have this same response.
"New Alexa skills for the Roborock S4 and S6 coming soonAccording to [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1963580733664463/permalink/2796526233703238/), Roborock is recruiting beta-testers for new Alexa skills for the latest S4/S6 models and the Roborock app. Hope they will add a voice command for cleaning a specific room, for example: ""Alexa, tell the Roborock to clean the living room."" Has anyone tested the new skills?"
"Use Alexa without having to say ask Roborock....Working great in my houseIt was great when they added room cleaning by voice... but sucked that you had to say ask roborock to clean the kitchen. Setting up simple routines you can just say Alexa, clean the kitchen. 

Just create a new routine for example:

When you say ""Clean the kitchen"". 

Next add a new action (make sure you click custom on the very top).

Next type ""Ask robo rock to clean the kitchen"" (note that Roborock has a space, if you dont put a space it will not work. Also need to spell the room name exactly how you have it in your Roborock app. I have set up all my rooms an it works perfect... thought id pass it along incase someone else was looking for this functionality."
"My S7 has Phantom Routines?Preface, I’ve already contacted support, but in the mean time, maybe you fine rando’s have seen this issue. 

I’ve got the S7, which I adore, and it cleans my house every night a little after 8. Which is cool, but I don’t want it to?! I can’t seem to find what is triggering this routine, but it only does it when connected to the internet. I changed the WiFi password which stopped the behavior, but it picked back up when added back to the WiFi, which tells me it’s not the robot, it’s something upstream. 

I’ve got a pretty simple setup, including some Alexa devices. I’d uninstalled and reinstalled the Alexa skill, and there’s no routine or hunch enabled. There’s also no routine scheduled in the app (running the latest update on both the app and firmware) and I cleared the cache as well. 

Is there a debug log or something that might indicate what triggered the cleaning events or something?"

"Alexa command for multiple roomsI just linked my S4 Max to Alexa using the roborock app and the roborock plus skill, named rooms, and can now tell the S4 to vacuum a specific room using Alexa. However, I can't figure out how to use a single command to clean multiple rooms. For instance, I'd like to tell the vacuum to clean the ""living room"" and ""dining room""... is there a way to do that with Alexa or does it need to be done manually in the roborock app?

Any help is appreciated, thanks!"
Alexa can clean rooms now!I didn’t read or see an update anywhere but just for fun I told Alexa “tell Roborock to clean the kitchen” and she responded with cleaning kitchen and the S5 max went to work! Tried again with my laundry room and worked as well! Not sure if everyone knows this so thought I’d throw it out there. Iv been waiting for this feature and super pumped it works now!
"Alexa Voice controlHas anyone successfully gotten the Roborock Plus skill to work with Alexa?  I have my account connected and it recognizes both my devices (one for the main level, one for upstairs). 

I have tried all the commands… using the robot name, using a room name, using NO name. And it just doesn’t work! If I don’t use a name, Alexa will ask me to pick one. It will name both devices and give each a number. I will reply with my choice and she will not understand. It’s super annoying. Any ideas on what I am doing wrong? 

I wanted to do specific room cleaning using Alexa but right now I’ll be happy if it just does something."
"Error when using Alexa room cleaningAs title suggests, I’ve been getting “Error” when asking my S5 Max to clean up select rooms via an Amazon Echo. Keeps persisting despite unlinking/relinking Alexa skill and up to date firmware.

Roborock s50 mop questionCan't seem to find an answer on this and I just got it so forgive me but does the mop attachment and cloth stay on all the time even if I'm just vacuuming? Or do I only attach it when I put it in mop mode?
"Roborock E4 Won’t Connect To AlexaBeen trying to connect my e4 to Alexa all day and to no avail. I have tried the roborock plus the mi home skill. I literally tried everything. Is there something I am missing.

"Selective room cleaning with Amazon Alex voice commandI know that you're able to initiate selective room cleaning with voice command for Google Assistant and Siri. But how about Amazon Alexa? I couldn't find any way to activate this with either the Roborock Plus or Hi Home Alexa skills.

"Connect S5 to AlexaHi! Love my S5. I am from Switzerland. I cannot connect it to Alexa. Roborock Home does not find it. And the Roborock App does also not find it, which is why I cant use the Roborock Plus Skill. Can anyone help? :-) Thank you!"
"S50 with roborock appYes, I know that is not available.

I want to know if there's a way to jerryrig the s5 max firmware unto the s50 since theyre fairly similar.

&#x200B;

I recently got an alexa echo and the mi home skill is simply not good enough. has just 2 commands for start and stop. the roborock plus skill though in comparison is actually very useful.

But since the roborock s50 is only compatible with the mi home app, it can only use the mi home skill.

So I want to know if I can change the firmware of the s50 to that of the S5 max, or get it work another way."
"Alexa RoutineHad my Roborock S5 Max for just over a week now and it is brilliant, my floors have never looked so clean. Now, to try and make it easier for the wife to use (technophobe), I’ve created a routine in Alexa so when you simply say “Alexa start vacuuming” it starts cleaning the whole floor but my only other option is for it to stop, it acts like a switch on/off, I don’t have an option for it to return to the charging dock. The reason why I’ve created the routine based on a specific term is because when trying to use the skill saying “Roborock” often responds with confusion and for my wife to remember and use it I need to make it as simple as possible. 

Hopefully makes sense? I know the skill has the functionality but I’m trying to build a routine to make it easier for my wife as she’ll never remember the Roborock phrase.

Thanks"
"Roborocks on unusual flooring? S5 Max vs...?New to the world of robotic vacuums - didn't ever go for one previously because they seemed to be so hit and miss for users. Anyway, thanks to Reddit I've started looking into Roborock. Considering the S5 Max. I have a small place (600 sq ft)...don't judge my lack of cleaning skills - ha! Anyway, most of the flooring is polished concrete, I also have a medium pile charcoal grey area rug and dark teal linoleum in the bathroom.

I have read about robotic vacuums as a whole having a problem with dark floors, but I wasn't sure if the types of flooring I'm mentioning might have a problem or if it is only black flooring.

I liked the mopping function on the S5 Max. Any other model I should consider based on user experience with that one? The cheaper the better, but of course I want to buy something good, reliable, and hopefully with longevity.

Edit: It did just occur to me that the Max is overkill on the size of my apartment so I imagine the S5 is really what I should be evaluating others against."

"Roborock S5 Alexa confusionI have a roborock S5 vacuum, and for some reason Alexa identifies it as either a light bulb or a light switch but not as vacuum. I have removed it and added back forcing it to identify it as a vacuum, but it just changes it back to a light. Google home does identify it as a vacuum. This vacuum is not supported by the roborock app but by the Xiaomi app instead so I can’t use the roborock skill to work with it either. 

Has this ever happened to anyone else? Is there a way to change that?

Roborock S8 Vs the new QRevoIt seems like the new QRevo will be really impressive. It almost seems as if it will be as good as the S8 series. The 7mm lift will be great. Its water tank is bigger. I'm assuming 1 roller. Seems like a better alternative to the S8 and S8+.

Additionally it **scratched** 120 m² of my white tiles from the rotary mob, my entire floor has visible tiny  scratches now.  
And **the map was damaged** 3 times in 2 months, it adds 4 ""Dining halls"" into my living room and a ""Corridor"" right into my Dining room. When that happens the automated cleaning will skip those ""new"" areas. To fix that I need to restore the old map from backup, then go into every single zone and setup the cleaning preferences once again (otherwise it needs 3 liters of water for one session which is more than the total amount available, it also uses 110% battery in that case)  


I have some mirrors and glas walls in my room, blocked by no-go lines. Those might confuse it (though not in my dining room)  


Sorry for ranting but these problems are important, Amazon is so friendly to take back my robot so I will exchange it.  
Either for a Deebot or for the Roborock.  


**Can you give me some guidance ?**  
Can you please let me know if some of those issues are also present in the roborock ?  
Especially if it uses so much water (the Dreame uses most of the water doing 3-4 times a self-cleaning action during the cleaning) and if the map destruction is something also happening with Roborock.  


I had a T9+ from Ecovacs before which had no issues at all with the map during 2 years of usage except for dreaming up a room behind a mirror. It also had sufficient water for ""slight"" mopping of my 150 m² with it's tiny tank.  


Any input, any issues you had that resemble my problems with Dreame would be highly appreciated."
"Quality of the Roborock appI have just purchased S7 MaxV, and while the robot itself makes a decent impression, the iOS app does not. I immediately noticed two things:

1. The password length for the roborock account limited to only 12 characters. Why? I see no reason for this limitation unless you intentionally want passwords to be easier to crack. Almost nobody does that.
2. Why there is no ipad version of the app? The interface looks ugly and unpolished

Honestly, it just seems lazy to release the app in such state. Especially when you charge well over $1k for your product and the app is actually one of the most important features. Even on the iphone, the UI feels like those other garbage apps, made as cheaply as possible.

Please Roborock, put more effort into it or hire a competent mobile app developer. It does make a difference for a lot of people."
"Bagless Dustbin Coming for Roborock?Ok so I'm new to robot vacuums and based on my research roborock are the best. Is anyone else out there waiting for the bagless auto empty dock for Roborock's next iteration? I figured if I'll get my first robo vacuum it'll be that one.

Anyone have any news on when to expect this? I know by the time it comes out it'll compete head on with Roomba's s10 when it comes out."
"Roborock S7+ vs iRobot j7+ & Braava M6Hi all,

Been doing some research and want to get a robot that vacuums and mops. Everything points to the Roborock S7+. My problem is I can't seem to find an S7+ anywhere in Canada. There's workarounds to get one across the border but the costs start to climb. They climb up to the point where I could grab an iRobot j7+ & the Braava M6 for the same price of a Roborock S7+.

Wondering if any folks on here would have advice as to how the S7+ competes with the iRobot combo. 

Thanks!"

"Tight Q5 brush on S7 MaxV update - genuine works!So after my recent post/video regarding the tight fit of the Q5 brush on my S7 MaxV, after some helpful comments asking if it was a genuine brush or not (it wasn't genuine), I went ahead and ordered what I hoped was a genuine Q5 brush on AliExpress.

I received the brush today that came in an official looking box (compared to the blank box the other one came in) and I tested it out.

It fits way better! No issues at all, and I'm loving what seems to be better pickup of pet hair and lint from my carpets.

The video shows how the brush fits and spins just fine compared to what you can see in my other video, and also the only real difference I can tell from the non genuine one; the little end bearing is removable. (There is also a very slight colour difference, and the bristles feel softer on the genuine brush)

Here is a link to some pictures of the box and the brushes side by side: https://imgur.com/gallery/XuFofxZ"
"Start Roborock Q7 Max based on phone location?Hello! I'd like to set up my Q7 Max to activate depending on my Android phone location, when I leave or return home.

I've tried using Google Home, but ran into problems. The Roborock doesn't show up on the list when setting up Household Away/Home Routines, even though it's linked in my devices.
When setting Personal Routines the vacuum is on the list, but the Personal Routines apparently cannot be triggered by phone location.

Any ideas? Doesn't have to be Google Home -based solution, I haven't got any other smart appliances (apart from one power plug) so I didn't try using that app at all before buying this Roborock. I'm working with an Android phone, so iPhone apps unfortunately aren't much help."
Battery life on s7Recently upgraded to an s7 with Auto empty dock. My old s5 max v was able to vacuum every room on max ×2 with out recharging but not the s7 is this normal
What is the best Roborock for carpet? I have the 7 max Ultra (which I love more than life) for downstairs which is all wood and tile but I want one for upstairs which is all carpet. Is there one that is good for carpet?
"Does the S7 MaxV water tank constantly release water or can I leave it in the tank?Sorry all, I tried to Google but couldn't really get a clear answer. I have the standalone so it's manual empty and fill for me and it just occurred to me to ask.

If it only ""activates"" a release when in mopping mode then i imagine I can just leave the tank full and dump it once a week or so."
What should I get? Going over after too many broken roombas and excited to see what direction you all point me in
"I'd sell my soul for an s7 max V or 8. Is it worth it?Man, I want one so bad! I haven't wanted anything this bad since I was a kid waiting for Christmas (I'm 30). All I do is watch review videos and search for a used one that's miraculously priced at half price. I show all my friends and family members. I know it's a vacuum but I'm obsessed lol. That price tag is bougie though and I can't do that right now.

For those of you that have it, is it worth it enough that I should save up for it? I've been thinking about getting a lower model, though I really don't want to. I also don't want to feel immense amount of buyers remorse if I do splurge. I have 3 cats who shed like crazy and have mostly carpets so I'm worried about a single roller. 

I'm also a tech enthusiast and am kinda obsessed with robo vacs so I want the best of the best lol."
"Please help choosing between Roborock Q5+, Roomba J7, or ......... 

Hey guys. I've researched more than I'd like to admit and still confused on what to get. My house is 60% hard floor, 40% carpet. Own 1 small dog. (never poops/pees in house. Just sheds a little)

Features I'd like to have:

1. Be able to spot clean a section of the house from the app. For example, if kitchen bar needs clean, I can spot clean a specific part of the map from the app.
2. robot avoid objects in floor. IE underwear/clothes, shoes, etc. Also want to identify on the map areas that robot can't go/bump into.
3. auto dispose bin would be great but not absolutely essential.
4. built to last. They are expensive and I expect it to last 10 years+. Only plan to buy extra brushes and battery replacement etc. down the line.

Roomba J7 pros:

1. better carpet cleaning, object detection for small objects like cords. Apparently roborock isn't as good as J7 bc it doesn't have camera. Easier to get replacement parts?

Roomba cons:

1. for price of q5+, doesn't have feature #3. Supposedly still has horrible mapping (bumps into objects all the time like the old school roomba did/do?). Doesn't use lidar.

Roborock Q5+ pros:

1. better mapping, more features. value for price (feature #3)

Robo cons:

1. doesn't clean carpet as good due to dual brush.

I'm leaning towards the roborock. Seems like most people agree it's significantly better overall. I think the only reason I'd go roomba is for better carpet clean and maybe easier to get parts down the road. I'm torn and would love some help.

I've also looked at Dreametech D10 Plus, Shark - AI, ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T10+. None of them seem to be as good as name brand roomba or roborock. I'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks!"
"Best value for money model?Hi all,

I'm currently looking at the following EU prices and I wonder where the sweet spot would be in terms of performance / price.

Q7 Max+ for 499S7 Pro Ultra for 1099S7+ for 818

I'm strongly leaning towards the Q7 Max+ since i can hardly imagine that the better dock / mopping features of the S7 Pro Ultra make it worth almost 2x the price? Or am I missing something here that would really make the S7 that much more valuable? Curious to hear your thoughts.

Oh and as a sidenote, for a house with multiple floors, should I consider to buy multiple units or does carrying the robot from one floor to another work generally well?"
"Wanting to purchase S8U. Have carpet question.So I've been waiting for the S8U. Today I read that the carpet plate lifts 5mm, and the unit is capable of cleaning 4mm high carpets because of the mop pad dragging. 

My house is probably 40% tile and 60% carpet. Kitchen and baths are tile.

My carpets are what I would describe as medium pile. I'm not home now so I can't measure. But, 4mm is damn short.. like carpet in a hotel. Mine are definitely taller than 4mm. 

Is the S8U, or Roborock, for that matter, a no-go for me? 

Can anyone with experience give an opinion please?

Thanks"
"Quick Mapping - Do you do closets/pantry?Just got my new S8 Pro Ultra and need to quick map the house. This is my first robot vacuum. Do you guys open all the doors even for the smaller closets/linen closets/pantry, etc?"
"Roborock S7 MAXV Ultra drain kit Chinese version. WORKING IN THE USA!Hello all,

I just wanted to provide input for US users of the MAXV ultra since I couldn't find many people trying to run the drain kit on 110v US voltage. It works with a simple 220v to 110v plug converter that they will include with the dryer from AliExpress. You don't need a voltage converter. It's dual voltage!

&#x200B;

**A couple of lessons learned here:**

1. Make sure you remove the rubber plugs (duh, lol!). It will seem like it's working, but it will clean it without water and won't drain.
2. Depending on your drain setup, you should only need 1/2 to 1/2 male connectors and use 2 1/2 inch to 3/8 faucet connectors. In my case, my faucet has the 3/8 connector attached, so I had to use a 1/2 female to 3/8 shutoff valve.
3. It calls for the check valve to be placed up top, but I placed mine at the entrance of the main drain pipe to avoid backflow issues. It works fine.
4. Snappy traps from Homedepot make this job more manageable. It has a drain for a garbage disposal drain that can be cut to fit the 3/8 drain pipe without issue. I added some self-adhering sealant tape around it for added leak safety.

Here is what I purchased:

1. Dry kit here: [https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804558176720.html?spm=a2g0o.order\_detail.order\_detail\_item.5.4a6cf19cqHyVlz&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&\_randl\_shipto=US](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804558176720.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.5.4a6cf19cqHyVlz&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&_randl_shipto=US)
2.

3. 1/2 x 1x2 male connector, Faucet connector, and snappy trap with drain from home depot.

I hope someone finds this helpful! **See attached images.**

I've been using it for a couple of days now, and so far, it's been awesome! I hope they provide a kit like this for the Roborock S8 Ultra because it's super helpful and really makes it automated."
"S7 MaxV cant identify the room it is in / does a new map every timeHey, my little helper seems to be unable to identify that its dock has never been moved so far.
Everytime he starts on his tours, he forgets his map, and seems to be unable to realise it is still on the same map i had him map out at the beginning. This kind of causes issues with telling him to go to specific rooms for example and routines...
oh, the map is set to single level. or rather, single map.

the dock is located in the living room, where furniture sometimes gets moved, depending on my households needs. does this cause the issue?
also sometimes one or more of the rooms are obviously closed off. either because the bot is unwanted that day, or someone simply forgot to open their door.

Any help or advice is appreciated!"
"I just want a way to edit maps and rooms on a laptop or a desktop web browserIt is frustrating to me using my phone (iphone) to edit the map, rename rooms, split them, add invisible walls...etc

I tried searching around but found nothing: Bluestack the android emulator doesn't run on Apple Silicon, the official app in the app store don't run on mac yet and any open source option require rooting and dissembling the whole thing, which is a no go for me.

As a last resort is there anyway to do it? maybe if even a way to edit the map on a laptop and then send it to my phone or something like that?"
"Voice/sound question.Is there a way to have to roborock make a beep noise llike the Roomba instead of the voice. I greatly prefer the beeps of my Roomba to the voice of my roborock. I find it more adorable. Especially the ""I finish cleaning and went home sound"".

Initial googling didn't show me anything, I can work out how to change files if I need to swap out some kind of programming text, I just need more to go on. I'm at a novice level with that stuff.

There is utility to make the roborock scream ""ouch"" every time it bumps into something, as funny as that is, that will probably be annoying after a short while so I'll save myself the time and not do that."
"S7 Maxv ultra dock availability and price in the future?I have the S7 Maxv+ which is amazing, absolute game changer, (GSD+Cat hair) but in hindsight I should have went for the Ultra dock combo. At the moment the ultra dock is €699  on [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de) which seems to be the only place to order to Ireland.   Will the S7 Maxv ultra dock come down in price soon or in the future eventually?  and will it continue to be available after the S8 release or will they discontinue it? Also if I do get the ultra dock, and put my s7+ dock upstairs, will the little fella use both docks dependent on what level I put it on?  To buy or not to buy."
"Has the purchase of your Roborock been worth it?I was hesitant to buy a robot vacuum considering the hefty price. I did my research and was thinking about buying one last year, but I balked. This year I thought about it again and it came down to the iRobot S9+ & the Roborock S7+. I paid $768 for the Roborock during Prime days. 

I've been really impressed with the intelligence of the technology and its ease of use. I was skeptical that a robot vacuum would be as effective and pick up as much as a regular upright, but it actually has picked up stuff my upright missed. I purchased the Cyclone dust bucket a few weeks later after not liking the whole bag experience. 

So yeah, it's been worth it for me. Of course, that will also depend on how long it lasts."
"S7 Max smart socket charging protocolI, like some others here, use a cheap smart socket as a charge controller for my S7 Max, to maximize its battery life. It's tricky to define the charging times though, because it's idle battery consumption isn't linear. It depends on how much charge the battery has.

In my case, it uses \~35% to vacuum the whole apartment, and it does so every weekday.

My charging protocol right now is the following:

* 1h charge at midnight (so it doesn not turn off);
* 2.5hrs charge from 9h20 to 11h50 AM (should give it \~40% before working);
* 1h working from 12h to 13h.

But this is far from optimal. Sometimes it starts complaining like 4 AM, because it's battery is at 1%. I end up doing extra charges, sometimes it does not have enough power to complete its job, and sometimes it enters trickle charging.

I'm thinking about just letting it go off, and stop doing the midnight charge. When it starts the pre-work charge, it goes on again automattically. I'll charge it to \~50% after work and see how it goes until tomorrow's work time. But I would like to see other charging protocols, if someone can share."
"S7 maxV ultra - irregular usage water problemsHi, I would like to ask about water in docking station/robot. All you guys seems to vacuum/mop every day. But what if I would like to use it once or maybe twice a week? What about the water in station and robot? Does it stink? Some problems? Like for my case it seems to just use regular mop once/twice a month and vacuum once/twice per week but don't tell me I'm the only here who wants high-tech robot but actually won't use it every day. Any experience from low usage owners? Thank you"
"Roborock longevity & long term support?As a person with one (very fluffy) dog and three long-haired cats, I've come to depend on my Roomba i7+. I've been thinking of upgrading to a robot vacuum with obstacle avoidance & mopping, though, and am between getting the j7+ combo and the roborock s8 pro ultra. I was wondering:

1. How are roborock products for long-term longevity? Can I expect \~4-5 years of daily vacuuming & self-cleaning? Given the price point, I couldn't justify 3 or less years of usage. The number of moving parts worries me about the s8 pro ultra.
2. I've read that roborock warranty/support can be lacking. Do you think I should get a third party extended warranty?

Thanks for any advice. I think I want to get the s8 pro max for its features but am slightly concerned that it won't live long enough to justify its price point."
Map dependant carpet rulesI have the new s7 and upstairs there is a very high carpet in the bedroom. Downstairs the carpet is ok for lifting the mop; upstairs not so. Would like to set different rules for different maps. Anyone thought of a solution for that?  Either that or no-mop zones? I.e. go for no mop installed; no go for no mop installed?
"Battery concernI bought my S7 MaxV last month and loving it!! However, not sure if the battery is faulty as the cleaning duration varies.  We have approx 140sq meter area for full cleaning, some days the battery lasts about 145mins and does the cleaning in one go but on some days the battery only lasts for 80-90mins, goes back to charging for about 2hrs and then resumes cleaning again which is a long time finish the full clean. And the unit is always charged to 100% before starting the full clean mode.  I would imagine that the battery run time should be consistent like any other good brand vacuum. I’m following this up with the technical team as there may be a technical fault with the unit and should be either repaired or replaced as it is a brand new unit and under warranty. and I bought this directly from the website and have been asked to send the unit back for checking which I’m really concerned as I’ve to pack it myself and worried if the unit gets damaged on the way. I think there should be better service provided for repair/replacement to have a secure way to send back the unit. I’ve flagged my concerns with the team and hoping to get an outcome that is easier to do and quicker."
"Keeps trying to go through wallDepending on where the robot is returning to the dock from, it keeps trying to go through a known wall. It can also happen when going from the dock and to a specific place. The wall is not really a wall, but the lowest step on my staircase. The dock is under the stairs.

It mostly goes around it, but sometimes tries to go straight through. I don't understand why. The bumper goes below it, but the lidar crashes into it. So the robot both gets stopped AND the lidar should be completely seeing the blockage because it crashes into it.

Also, the map shows a solid wall there.

But rather than trying to go around and using the known working path, it just crashes into it several times before giving up. You'd think that it would just try to go around it when crashing repeatedly into the same spot?

I'm afraid it will ruin the lidar over time."
"New Roborock won't turn onI recently purchased a Roborock S7 MaxV, which worked great for around 2  weeks, then during one clean, in an open space it just started spinning in a circle, and seemed lost, unable to do anything. It wouldn't respond to any commands or return to the dock. Then it lost connection in the app. A factory reset didn't work and was unable to install the original firmware. It kept  trying, then eventually it said ""unable to turn on, contact roborock support"".

Just wondering what people would do in this situation? Roborock have offered to repair it, but I'm concerned about repairing a brand new product with a major hardware fault after a small amount of usage, as I feel this may lead to further issues down the track.

My preference is for a new replacement, but they are out of stock for several months.

Is it safe to repair, or better to refund and perhaps wait for the S8 model, or just wait a few months for new stock to arrive?

As this is my first robot vacuum, i'm keen to hear from others what they would do. Roborock reviews sound great. Did I just receive a lemon?"
"a doubt!!I have a roborock s7 maxv without the automatic emptying station, and I would like to know if I can put alcohol inside the robot's water tank. Is alcohol harmful to the components of the device? I saw people commenting on putting vinegar too. Which would be more suitable? Does that make a bit of difference in cleaning or is it negligible?"
"About disinfectant product for cleaningHey !

I will receive my S7 next Wednesday and I would like to choose the right cleaner, what’s about alcohol ? Especially what do you think about the product who contains :

Disinfectants (L(+)-Lactic acid (CAS No.: 79-33-4): 0.816% (m/m), Ethanol (CAS No. m 64-17-5): 0.125% (m/m)).
<5%: citric acid, disinfectants (lactic acid and ethanol), anionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, sequestrant, perfume (tea tree oil).
Also contains: water, alcohol denaturant.

See the product [here](https://www.maisonverte.fr/product/nettoyant-sol-desinfectant/), sorry only in french.

Do you know some recommended products ? I would like a disinfectant product.

Thanks ! And happy new year !"
"Can I left water in combo container?I have a Q7 model and I read in the manual that it is best to empty the combo container of water after each mopping. 

However, I noticed that without the mopping attachment on, the robot (smartly :D) does not mop. 

Can leaving water in the container somehow harm the robot? I would change it at least once a week anyway."
Hi does anyone know where i can find the ribbon cables for Tanos V?
"No Mop Zones depending on if the mop is attached?If you set up a no map zone and the mop is attached, will it just not go there? And if you do not have the mop attached it will go there?

I probably assumed wrongly that it would simply turn off the dripping of water when it got to the no mop zone. And setting water to 'no' will also not make it go into the no-mop zone, apparently."
Do floor vents cause problems?Looking at getting a Roborock in the near future. I own a Neato right now and it has issues getting stuck on floor vents. I’m wondering if different models of Roborocks handle floor vents better than others. I have a two story house so taping off drop sensors is not an option and I’m not sure how well no go lines will work on such a small area. Thanks for any replies.
Will these replacement parts from S7 be fine for my S7 MaxV?
"Is anyone noticing issues with the latest firmware for S7 MaxV Ultra? (02.56.02)Hey all,  


I recently purchased the S7 MaxV Ultra after tons of research and the Black Friday sale that was going on. Everything led me to the S7 MaxV. However, it seems to be getting stuck and sucking up everything that I would expect with all the features it has.  


For example, I do have cats, so yeah, they're like toddlers, and sometimes they leave toys out, so I was curious how it would run with these left out, and the roborock straight clobbers them, and they're fairly larger toys too. I've noticed it sucking up a cord, running over a shoe and getting stuck on it, and even a blanket. I feel like I'm babysitting this instead of letting it perform.   


Am I wrong to assume it shouldn't be doing this? My less expensive shark would avoid these with no problem. I upgraded to the Roborock for the more advanced features, as well as mopping and mop cleaning at the dock.   


After some research online and on this sub, I've noticed a few people in the past have problems after recent firmware. I'm on the current one, or at least it shows that it's up-to-date for me (02.56.02); is anyone else having these problems? I feel like for over $1000 USD, it should at least be avoiding bigger objects like a shoe."
"S7 (without dock) or Q7 max+ (with dock)Hello,

I'm about to buy one of those. S7 (without dock) \[450€\] or Q7 max+ (with dock) \[500€\].

How to do 2 pass with Roborock S7Is It possible to adjust the Roborock S7 to first run only vaccum and the second run only mop? How can I do that? Thanks a lot
"sharing thoughts 4 month in on a s7maxv ultra (150h, +8000m2, 300 + cycles)Hello,

First things first:
- is it perfect ? 
No,  but I can deal with it.
- is it best robot for me at this moment?
I think so,  been a long term robot vac user (2016) but I don't upgrade alot (had 2) because they keep doing their job.
- do you use it daily ?
Yep , generally livingroom (wood)+ kitchen (tiles) vac in the morning when we leave for work, another mop in the kitchen just before bedtime.
Upstairs (sleeprooms , bath room) typically get a on average a weekly mop session  in the weekend, since the old bot is doing daily vac's upstairs.
Other rooms cleaned are 'on request only' 
-besided doormats we don't have carpets.
- it probably got stuck less than 5 times ever ( can't even remember the last time). I do remember that a few times I got a weir error about location not reachable.  I tend to remember only 1 entanglement (fake hair extension hair bundle thingy)
- I have not enabled the 'picture mode' so I only get obstacles and fibre, pets waste, indicators)

Dirt producers:
3 person family (260 m2 house)
1 parrot ( god damn the fine dust and food it throws around)
1 dog (short hair)
No shoes/dog upstairs (greatly reduces dirt upstairs)
Wood floor in living room tiles elsewhere and fake wood floors upstairs.



Things I do:
- Let's face it => even if it has ai, a bot prepared home will make it much more efficient.   So chairs and stools (dog toys) generally placed in 'optimum' positions.  It's much faster when it doesn't need to avoid and run around things. 
- depending on the dirt degree I sometimes 'pre wipe the corners and sides with a mop). This avoid the rounded circles in corners and  basically negates the visible not cleaned borders and corners.
- I clean the dock at least 1 time per week.  Take the filter out and take some wipes and paper to get filt out.   If I don't do it it will get 'smelly',. There is stail /smelly water underneath the filter:(
- I have 3 mop pads I rotate when needed.  Mid week I generally try to extend the mop life time and also avoid dock smell, by rinsing the mop and letting it soak a bit of water with a table spoon of bleach (to kill the germs), after the soak I rinse it wel and reattach it. 
And even after trying to really clean it well, it's surprising how dirty the bleach solution gets if you use this.  I find it greatly extends/removes the mid week smellynes.  And even if you wash the mops in the washing machine, the bleach seems to help.
- dock maintenance:. Rinse the filter,. Wipes and paper , a few squirt of table top cleaner and to give the dock a good wipe down.   Oh yes these small brushes are all gone by now.  They are fragile as 🦆.
- dirty water tank gets cleaned when I think about it.  After rinsing it gets a squirt of tabletop cleaner to minimize possible smells.
- been running an aftermarket cleaning agent for bots since day one.
- as said in weekend it generally does the upstairs.  I have pattern of rooms that result in approx  20 mins runs,. When done I carry it to the dock and let's it rinse and onto the next rooms etc ...
- rarely I empty the clean water tank dock and the bot reservoir to do a dedicated wooden floor session ( I also do a pre mop side border run in this case ). And refill it with a dedicated wooden floor care solution.  And then basically let it  do  'deep' mop sessions generally 4x until the clean water container is empty , this takes a fews hours (also needs to charge) and the living room floor is happy (and slippery as 🦆).   It's not as good as doing it manually but it's good enough and saves me half a day of work ( the manual  border pre mop really makes really a difference and I regard it as mandatory in this case because it leaves an intentional film behind and would probably result in clear marks)
- 1 time the bot bin got clogged some hair got entangled. I noticed by the fact the dock emptying sound changed and I didn't hear any debree passing. It only happens once so I'm not keeping a close eye. But If I hear it emptying I take a listen if I hear debree passing..... (which means it's not clogged, with the parrot there is ALWAYS debree)
- oh yes I taped over the underside charging pads they start to corrode/scratch a bit.  With the tape it 'fixed'


The not so goods:
- it's still a bot so it has its quirks (ghost obstacles,  ...)
- roborock plz fix the room / map drift it's quite annoying.
- release notes are only usefull if the are indicating more then 'fixed some bugs'
- accepting /ignoring obstacles doesn't to make alot of difference , so I stopped doing it (unsure if this makes a difference if I would enable picture mode)
- construction of the dock should be improved to avoid stail water in the dock
- a bring me to the dock mode (on a none dock floormap) would be helpful,. Pausing the bot to take it downstairs and let it find the dock seems to 'merge the maps'. ??! 
Therefore I adopted approx 20 mins upstairs runs => it ends tried to find the dock and goes to sleep. I take it down it switches maps, rinses and I let it restart the next upstairs mop session and again it will switch maps)
- its really, really hard to just fast stop a session....
- I would love to have the option to 'cancel for this run or next X runs this task) or delay for XX minutes the next run. Sometimes it's just handy to do that.


And the question I can't answer but I get asked alot from persons.
What the 🦆?, 1400 eur for a robot, is it worth it.    Meh difficult question.   I never imaged I would pay 1400 for a bot, even my first one was about 350.   But then again I never thought to spend 1000 + on a smart phone since the last few generations......

So would I get the 'next Generation'  hard to say.  Currently I can't imagine what I would like to see improved that would trigger me to upgrade,  I can't plumb it into the water and drain in my specific situation.   

Different statement. I hope it doesn't breakdown and no warranty but if it would stop working , I would probably again buy this type of robot, because it helps in the household and with the parrot a vac bot is a must, and the mop / dock feature is a very useful plus."
Would like my s7 max v to clean furthest room first then work it's way back. Any way to do this?I recently got my s7 maxv ultra and run it when I go to walk my dog. I'd like it to clean the entranceway of the house first which is farthest from the dock which is in the bedroom. is there any way to select which room order it cleans in?
"Roborock Android app permissionsWhy does the android app need active access to internet and GPS  to connect to a Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra?  


Technically there's no reason: they can both be on the same network, without GPS or internet access, and the pairing could be done through IPs. All the advertised functionality doesn't depend on either GPS or internet access.  


The security implications of having both the robot and android app connected to the internet are tremendous and the only benefit I can think of would be automatic firmware updates and anonymous usage data triggering the above-mentioned updates."
"""slow network""Cannot clean today.

Climbing issueThe robot cannot access my master bathroom as there is a granite pop up which it cannot climb over. Can I just select that room and then physically pick the robot up and put it there? Will it vacuum and wash once in there?
"First run left wheel marksJust got my s7 maxv ultra today. First run left tires marks in my kitchen. It was steam mopped with no cleaner two days ago, so I'm ruling that out. Also, no cleaner in the dock tank. My kitchen tile is black, though. It shows EVERYTHING. I'm going to run it a few more times, but I'm not hopeful here."
Can you mop after vacuum run is complete automatically?From what I understood when you vacuum and mop it does both simultaneously; so can you set it to mop AFTER the vacuum run is complete automatically?
"Debating S6 to S7+ UpgradeMy S6 has been great for the roughly 2.5 years I’ve owned it, but I’m itching to upgrade to a model with self emptying (especially with the great deals going on right now). 

A friend is trying to convince me that if I’m going to upgrade, I may as well just the the S7 MaxV Ultra for a little bit more. I don’t entirely disagree, but I am worried about the sheer size of the thing - it looks like it takes up a lot of space.

I have a roughly 1,300 square foot apartment, about 50/50 split of low pile carpet and vinyl flooring. I rarely use the mop feature on my current unit, so I’m skeptical the S7’s mopping (and automatic mop cleaning) abilities are strong enough to get me to use it regularly. 

TLDR: Looking for comments/experience around…
1 - Is the Ultra dock too big to find space for in an average sized apartment?
2 - Is the mopping improved enough that it could replace mopping by hand? Or is it just good to supplement regular mopping?"
"App is too small on iPhone to create roomsI have an older iPhone with a small screen. Since my house is an open floorplan, I'm trying to create rooms since my S7 won't do it automatically. It's impossible for my old fingers to manipulate the red lines on the app to create separate rooms. Every time it looks like it's going to work, I hit the check mark and see ""FAILED."" I looked for an app for my PC but the only thing I found looks like spamware and I'm not tech savvy enough to understand bluestacks and that sort of thing. Anything I can do to create rooms easily?"
"Is a map per floor correct, did I do this properly?"
"Getting root on standard S6I've been following the instructions detailed [here](https://arner.github.io/posts/#root-your-xiaomi-vacuum) to get root on my non-pure, non-max plain S6 vacuum but I've run into a snag. Whenever I try to run the command to actually install the custom firmware, I get the error:

    Error: unable to parse payload
    Error: miio.updater: No request was made..

The instructions say that the custom firmware that gets built is supposed to come in a .pkg format but I was sent .tar.gz instead. Is this the problem?"
"S7 changes sweeping/mopping direction after the latest firmware updateHi, since the latest firmware update for my S7 (02.15.36), my robot has suddenly started sweeping in the short direction of the rooms, rather than the long direction (following the floor planks) as it used to earlier. Has anyone else experienced this?"
"Trying to patiently wait…So we just moved in to a two story house. We have a Q5 that will run upstairs while the S7maxV will run downstairs (whenever it gets here)

My question is can the two vacuums share maps? Right now we move the Q5 up and down depending on what needs done more. Once the new one comes will it be-able to just takeover the downstairs map or will it need to re-do the map? I have already added all the furniture and things. Will I need to redo it?"
"S7 In EuropeSo, I checked the official Roborock website for the EU and I also messaged them to confirm.

They list Aliexpress, Geekbuying and Ebay as official links to purchase the S7 (all out of stock except Ebay, which is more expensive).

Although I already have Roborock, I bought mine from Amazon Spain, but RR were evasive, and it looks like they will not be selling on Amazon anymore (all the other RR products are out of stock).  I can't help wondering if this is because Amazon have such a superb returns policy, and if we buy from Ebay or Aliexpress,  if something goes wrong, we are left holding the baby?

It seems strange that a company which is so popular it can't keep up with demand wouldn't have a legitimate sales outlet with dependable customer service (when the wheel housing of my 2 month old s6 Max broke, they didn't want to know and referred me back to Amazon to get it sorted).

For this reason, I am reluctant to purchase from Ebay, which is the only place which has stock right now."
"Changed from Ecovacs OZMO 950 to Roborock S5Max. What I wish I knew review.Hi,

TLDR: I had an Ecovacs Ozmo 950, worked great for 2 months then had constant anti drop sensor errors. Had service, was worse when it got back. Returned it, bought a Roborock S5 Max a few months later. It has it's flaws, mostly with the app. I would have been happy with either, RR just need to fix the sequencing.

There are things I wish I had known before buying the Roborock (RR). I looked at plenty of reviews and many people saying that they bought an S7 but wish they had stayed with their S5 Max. I was also looking at an Ecovacs T8 AIVI, but the problems with my first Ecovacs (EV) made me want to change, especially after a service that seemingly did nothing.

**Vacuum Performance**: *Winner Ecovacs*. I don't know if it because of the two side brushes vs one on the RR, but in my situation the Ecovacs did better for cleaning my low pile carpet. I have been getting a lot of main brush errors on the RR but it does seem it was because I didn't have carpet boost on. Regardless, I didn't have it on with the EV and it still cleaned better.

**Mopping Performance**: *Winner Ecovacs*. You can't beat a steam mop, the EV left a wet line behind it but it didn't actually clean any marks. Same with RR. I have to give this to the EV because it detects carpet and doesn't go over it, only around it. With the RR I have had to set No Mop Zones all over the map. The RR is much easier to detach the mopping pad.

**App Mapping**: *Winner Roborock*. I have many low windows and have the same problem that it sees out the windows and gives an off looking map. RR didn't split the rooms well (most of the house was one colour), the EV app did that perfectly, but the accuracy was better with the RR. Roborock wins because I mapped once and it was perfect. I needed 6 attempts to get a good one with EV and then if I had to manually move it to clean, it would reset, occasionally the map would turn and it would lose the dock. The RR got lost last night and lost the dock on the map. I put it back on the dock and it retained and returned the original map and knew where it was. I had a corruption in the RR map, I restored it in the map and it was back to normal, no remapping required. RR wins this easily.

**App Splitting and Merging**: *Winner Roborock* (and it isn't even close). I tried splitting and merging with the EV app and it is so bad, so unsuccessful, it should never have been released. Thankfully I could undo before messing up my map again. Depending on your room (like if there are two entrances) you need some different thinking to split rooms with the RR app, but it works perfectly. So easy to do.

**App Scheduling / Sequencing**: *Winner Ecovacs*. The EV was easier to create custom schedules and select the room sequence. It was ordered in the order I pressed on the room. RR requires you to edit the map and select the sequencing, but this is for the whole map. If I want to schedule to do just three rooms, you have to use the overall sequence for that. If i have seven rooms but don't sequence the last 4, it just does them after. RR need to fix this so that when I select rooms in my schedule, it is done in the order of selection. An overall sequence only makes sense if always doing a full clean, which is likely only when mapping initially.

**Navigation**: *Winner Roborock*. I would constantly see the EV bumping into straight walls. It would go along a bit turn in, bump reverse, go ahead more, turn in bump etc, all the way along. The RR hugs the skirting board with rarely a bump against the wall. The EV also gets hung up badly trying to do around chair and bed legs and wastes a lot of time. I saw my EV once spend 40 minutes navigating around a mat when mopping. It detects and won't mop over it, but it won't do straight lines around it either.

**Overall**: So, I would have to say that the extra cost for the RR was worth it so far. For me and the troubles I had with the EV mapping, the app is very important to work well. I wasted so many hours having to remap the house multiple times. RR need to fix sequencing for schedules. I have a schedule that starts at 4am, i want the rooms furthest from the dock and bedrooms done first. It needs to be done in the map editing, but should be in the schedule which makes more sense. I only had my EV for 3-4 months and it is still early on for the RR. I accept that there is a teething period and so far I am happy with the RR. I think I would have been happy with the EV but I just couldn't trust it or their support after a bad experience before."

Ultra dock as upgrade for S7 MaxV?I got a “standalone” S7 MaxV right now. Any info if it will be possible to get it to work with the ultra dock once it gets available? Can’t imagine that the S7 MaxVs have different features depending if you bought them with the dock or not.
"S6 firmware questionMy s6 is currently on 01.27.00, is it fully up to date, and if not how do I force it to update."
"Am I wrong to think the mop function of the Roborock (and probably any other mopping robot) just redistributes dirt when it mops?I mean, I love my Roborock and all but it was just a thought I had. When manually mopping you'll go back to the bucket and wring out the dirt that was picked up and go back at it. With a mopping robot, it's just redistributing the dirt to other parts of the room it's cleaning.

Am I looking at this the wrong way?"
"Need help choosing a model!I've been looking for a Roborock vacuum cleaner and stopped on two models -   


S5 Max  
S6 MaxV(around 70 euros more expensive)  


From my research, both should be good, but I'd rather ask people who actually use those just to make sure. I have two concerns:   


1) I have a cat(Scottish Fold, hair fairly short), it shouldn't be a problem, right?  
2) What I'm mostly concerned about - Most of my rooms are separated with a frame/ramp or however you call it, depending on the room it can go up to 3cm tall or so. Are those robots capable of climbing those?  


Other than that, I have a carpet almost in every room except for kitchen, so there's a lot of places where the robot should go from the floor onto a carpet. So any recommendations are very much appreciated!"
"S7 suddenly fails 90% of the time on doorstepsi have had my S7 for close to 6-7 months, normally it would get stuck once every 2 weeks or so - no problems. But for the last 1½ week, i have not had a single complete succesfull run. If i get lucky it cleans 1 maybe 2 rooms (out of 6) - it literally have a 90% chance of it getting stuck on a doorsteps.

I tried the following:  
* Firmware Factory Reset  
* Updated firmware to the newest version  
* Tried with and without watertank & mop  
* Tried with full watertank & mop  
* Tried with empty watertank & mop  
* Tried getting some any slip tire skins

I have a S7 from the US and just saw a bagless dock on Aliexpress for a decent price. I HATE bags, so I'm really tempted. But I know there are some firmware differences on Roborock products depending on the country. Worse is the listing on Aliexpress doesn't specify if it's the EU version that's both the bag and bagless system or the Chinese one that's only bagless. 

Any help would be super appreciated."

"Scheduled cleaning notifications (Roborock app) on cellularA bit of an oddball question, but for those of with scheduled cleanings in the Roborock app, do you receive the notifications if you're not connected to your home's wifi? I was out of the house today and was only on cellular service, yet did not receive any of the normal alerts I get from the scheduled cleaning. I can't find any mention of this being wifi-dependent, and the app has cellular access in my iPhone."
"Free Idea to Roborock to improve corner, edge cleaning.Here's a free idea, would love to see this on newer models. Redirect the exhaust to blow air directly at the wall when near corners or edges.  The air will rush down when it meets the wall and push dust and hair into the center of the room. Then proceed to clean as usual.

Corners are the one thing these kind of vacuums continue to struggle with and its an easy fix. You already have a big fan in there, just exhaust it to small port pointed to the wall while you're edge cleaning. Otherwise vent to the back like usual."
"Two questions about S7. Carpet behaviour different for each room? Sucking power on different levels?Hi everyone,

I have recently upgraded my vacuum, from the very first model Xiaomi vacuum cleaner, to the Roborock S7.

So far I have seen many positive sites, I have also seen some things, which I find better in old version.

1) What I really miss now in s7, is the feature to select carpet behaviour separate for each room.
For example in one room I would like the robot to ignore the space when there is a carpet, don't go on it, and when there is no carpet in that room, work normally (carpet is not always there), when in other rooms, I would like the vacuum to go on carpet, if they are there, as there are lower ones.

Is there such an option? No go zones don't make the job.

2) do you know what is the sucking power depending on the level? Max is 250Pa, what about the other levels,how many Pa they do have? 
If anyone knows, so you know what are those levels for the Xiaomi vacuum cleaner?

Thank you and warm regards!"
"My s7 takes more than 6 hours to charge upIs this normal behaviour for s7 ?

Out of the box my s7 had 50ish percentage battery.

After doing an initial full run, next day when i gave it another run, i noticed it was at 57% percent battery when leaving the dock ! 
I gave it extra tasks to deplete it's battery and when the battery hit 23% , it paused cleaning and went to dock to charge. 4 hours later i saw that the battery was  charged to 57% and i thought this is max capacity my defective robot has.

But 6 hours later i checked as i created a support ticket with roborock and noticed it was 93% charged.

But the bot did not complete the pending mop..

I woke up, and checked and it's at 100% , when i open the mi home app, i can see it has done partially tasks (prior to battery draining) and the map shows my zones which are yet to be cleaned .  So it hasn't auto resumed.  Is there settings that i have to choose for it to auto resume after it's charged ?"
"2 design updated I wished s7 hadI just saw the 360 s10 vaccum and it's bin is enormous and it's system of emptying is great, there is 0 contact with dust. I am extremely allergic to dust.

Very impressive with their bin design.

Another design that I wished s7 had on the self emptying.. another brand bot had a small duct from which the self emptying bin sucked out the collection.  It looked more efficient than the suction of previous gen self emptying bin and the current s7 gens.. 
They even advertised the suction on these generally lead to clogs.
Anyone using self emptying bins of those kinds on non roborock series can confirm this ?

When the self empty bin releases I am doubtfull to get it or not depending upon apparently it's old design and if that design has clogging issues."
"Robot Only vs. Occasional Upright (Carpet)Only with the dependability of RR have I considered the robot enough. I'm 7 or 8 weeks in to RR from Roomba.

Having vacuum lines every day is great! But now, I'm thinking it's not quite as... fluffy as it is after the super strong Dyson.

The thing is, it seems the RR's (I have an S6 MaxV and an S5 Max) seem to get every bit as much dirt up. So this week, I'm starting a weekly vacuum of at least the 2 main carpeted rooms with higher traffic. I'm not sure the low pile, low traffic areas benefit as much.

So just curious - especially from the long-timers - RR only, or occasional upright?

"Important! Remember to descale your S5 MaxHello everyone,

After using the robot for about 10 months, I have noticed a peculiar issue - the nozzles begin to clog up. I have cleaned them with a bathroom cleaner prior to taking the picture, but you can still see it. The situation was much worse before.
Pic: https://imgur.com/JrpB0UJ

I guess it depends on the hardness of the water, but have you noticed the same issue? Have you applied any remedies? 

I was thinking about using coffee descaling liquid. Maybe somebody has done it already? Let me know your ideas on the issue."
"Mopping Streak Mop head needs improvement.I can’t be the only one. The mop head doesn’t apply adequate pressure and / or the mop itself is too thin leaving streaks and some areas unmopped. 

I think it depends on your surface so YMMV but it’s clearly an issue. 

I’ve tried pre-wetting and varying water flow.  

This is an inherent flaw in operation. 

Apparently some people are sewing cloth into the mop heads?

Can anybody link to that.

UPDATE: I took another of the mops, cut out the velcro , inserted it under the mop and used the velcro to secure the bottom mop in place. Now it works flawlessly. 

Will sew a a bunch of these in together."
"Multiple Docks for a single s6 Maxv?Im thinking of picking up the S6 MaxV off amazon for prime day for my new 3 story home im moving into soon.

Would the MaxV be able to register each dock and dock itself depending on which floor its on?"
"Roborock S6 Pure - Mapping issues?Hi all,

I’ve had a Roborock S6 Pure for about a month now and apart from repeated, unexplainable “Device Offline“ / wifi connectivity issues, it’s been great.

But, I’m now having issues with my saved maps - downstairs and upstairs. On the main page, I used to have the option of selecting which of the two maps applied depending upon where the Roborock was located. But, for some reason, I now only have one map saved there?

I restored the missing map (upstairs) and the vacuum is now trying to clean based on the restored map, except it’s “started” about five metres to the left of the true starting point (ie. the same location where I put the dock every time). So, it thinks it is cleaning the home office, but it was actually cleaning the family room using its saved map of the home office. It’s all a bit of a mess.

As mentioned the dock is in exactly the same spot - I marked the wall so that I would put it in exactly the same spot every time.

Do I need to start all over again? That would be a pain since I’ve divided all the rooms and created various no-go zones."
"Roborock S6 MaxV from the original Xiaomi Mivac - IKEA Poang chairs?I've had the original Xiaomi Mivac since 2017, and just upgraded to the S6 MaxV- received yesterday. I could never run the Mivac completely unattended: the brush would stall on carpeted areas, about a fourth of my house is carpeted (700 sqft) including the living room. It also would dig itself under furniture occasionally, I solved most of those issues with putting racetrack bumpers under furniture.

The S6 MaxV overall is very impressive, Balanced mode is relatively quiet, the buil-tin switch on the radar to keep it from digging under furniture works well, ReactiveAI in general has done a good job not pushing shoes around. The Roborock app is much faster to update than the Xiaomi app, though I'm sure this is location dependent-- I had to use the Xiaomi app with mainland China server.

The S6 MaxV has one bad regression from the original Mivac: Ikea POANG chairs. Because of the higher threshold climbing of the S6 MaxV, the MaxV tries to climb over the POANG chair's base while the Mivac would (usually have given up), and ends up getting stuck.

Those who own POANG chairs and a Roborock, do you have any solutions to this issue?

It would be nice if the app could parameterize a ""threshold climbing aggressiveness"", both as a global setting, and within rooms, to avoid a furniture climb... along with training ReactiveAI on larger furniture to avoid aggressive climbing."
"Looking to replace my EufyHi all!

A couple years ago, I purchased a Eufy 11 and last year got the 15C. I'm disappointed with how both models quickly declined in quality and incessantly beeped over every little thing (MOST of the time it was invisible things). I shouldn't have to take apart a $200+ device to get it to work.

So I started digging around, looking into dropping money on an actual Roomba, when I found out about the Roborock. But there are so many models to pick from that I have no idea where to get started.

Here are my criteria:

* Under $300-ish
* Doesn't beep incessantly for no apparent reason
* Mopping not required
* STRONG suction
* Able to clean a 1000 sq ft space
* Connectivity to Alexa or Android app
* Spot cleaning capability

I think that's all I've got! I only need to use it on the 1st floor of my apartment, which is an open floor containing my living room (low carpet) and kitchen (wood). All of my furniture has tall legs, so no issues with robots getting stuck under things. I have rabbits and I really depend on my robovacs to help me suck up stray poops and other debris in between full vacuuming with my stand-up vacuum.

Thanks in advance for the suggestions. I'd rather get some real input because I'm a little burnt out from trying robot vacuums that don't work."
"Where grey SDZS02RR main-brush belongs to? Definitely not to S5 MaxI bougth a replacement brush from same brick'n mortar shop I bought my S5 Max. This new thing collects dust over the square-in-circle wheel that turns the brush. The grey end wheels are fixed so I need to use a sharp pin to remove hair, instead of just taking it apart and use my fingers.

So, is this brush ment for some other model, or is this just a crappy fake? It depends how I shall complain. They're not knowlingly selling fakes as originals I'm sure, but that model was all they had in shelves so maybe it's just bad labeling."
"Is there a difference in the frequency of changing a washable versus non-washable filter for S6 Roborock?Hi friends, 

Have read on [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) \-  that filters should be washed approximately once a week and replaced every 3-6 months, depending on usage.

However some of the third-party filters are non-washable, would I need to change it more frequently compared to a filter that is washable?"
"Roborock S6 MaxV map saving not workingA couple of weeks ago we received our Roborock S6 MaxV. So far I regret buying it a lot!

I have a large house, kids and some carpets. Being able to manually select rooms to clean, areas to avoid, no mopping zones and so on was a big selling point for me. The first time it ran it made a map with map saving mode enabled. The next time it tried to clean a single room it messed everything up and could not even find the dock. Next time it had to make a new map again. When using that map it apparently thought the dock was in another room than it really is, so everything became messed up again. This keeps happening every time! I dont think it has ever successfully used a map without messing everything up. Usually its because of the dock moving from the living room to the kitchen next door for no apparent reason.

Am I the only one? Any suggestions? I know the app says the app saving feature is in beta, but a lot of the features depend on them. If I had known that a lot of the selling points were in beta and not working I would never have bought it."
"Magnet strips for S6?We got a Roborock s6 and are very happy with it, but contrary to other threads here we find it's almost chewing up our carpet. The other day I noticed it was sweeping dirt around instead of sucking it up, checked the dustbin after it had been on the carpet a few rounds and holy smokes, the entire dustbin was filled with what looked like our carpet in dryer lint format!

So naturally we're looking to make our roborock avoid the carpet, but we have a somewhat flexible layout (carpet included) which we switch up depending on when we get guests and how many, so a no-go zone won't do.

My question is, do magnetic strips work for the s6, and  would they work if they were placed along the perimeter of the carpet, but on the underside? Would the magnetic field be strong enough for the sensors to pick it up or would the strip have to protrude somewhat outside the perimeter of the carpet?

All magnetic strips I've found are black, which is quite jarring against our hardwood floor. Do magnetic strips of color exist, to at least try and camouflage the appearance?

Thanks."
"S4 Pathfinding WinThere are two entrances to our kitchen depending on which side of the house you come from.  I was doing a deep clean of the kitchen floor, and so had a number of items moved out of the kitchen to get behind and under them.  Collectively they blocked off one of the entrances to the kitchen.

I used room cleaning to tell our S4 to clean the kitchen.  It didn't even occur to me that the S4 would try to get into the kitchen from the ""blocked"" side (usually it comes through the other door during routine cleaning duties) but this time it did.  After a few failed attempts to get into the kitchen from the blocked side, it turned around and went through the living room to get to the other entrance, got into the kitchen, did it's thing, then went home.  I was pretty impressed.  That's better path-finding than some video games I play!  Hah."
"PSA: All theee models of the S8 series have different capacity dustbin and water tanks.The S8 has a 400ml dustbin, while the S8 Plus and S8 Pro Ultra has 350ml dustbin. The S8 and S8 Plus have 300ml water tanks while the S8 Pro Ultra has a smaller 200ml tank.

Interesting they went this route. The S7 MaxV series had identical dustbins and water tanks capacity between all three models."

I'm looking for advice on a new battery replacement for my Roborock S7 vacuum. I've had it for about two years and the battery is starting to show signs of aging and doesn't complete my apartment in a single cycle.

Does anyone have experience with a battery replacement on their S7 vacuum? There's a ton of replacement options on Ali Express and Amazon, not sure of a reputable one and can't seem to find an OEM battery.

[This one has good reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SPW9S59/) but some people say it's lower capacity than original, and I'm not sure what to purchase!

Thanks in advance!"
"Plz help!!!!! : Roborock errorSorry for the dramatic title but hope it got your attention.

Been using the S7 since the last 3-4 months with no issues. I host dogs over regularly and so I have tons of pet hair to be cleaned off the floor.

Have been getting this error message lately: 

""Clean the Auto - Empty Dock Bin : Dock dustbin or air duct jammed; Check and make it clean""

I noticed some posts where folks had similar problems but could not find any concrete answers. What part of the set up do I need to clean? I have emptied the dustbin internally, cleaned all the parts, checked for capacity in the dust bag, etc. Is there some part that needs to be opened up and manually unclogged?

Something to mention: Initially the vacuum used to do a thorough job of picking up the pet hair. Now it rolls them up and leaves clumps on the carpet. Wooden floor is cleaned well though.

Thanks in advance for any solutions."
"S7 MaxV Ultra aka G10S Pro Dock ""Smart Drainage Kit"" inconsistent dosing [firmware BUG]...I recently installed the [Roborock Smart Drainage Kit / Smart Drying Kit](https://item.m.jd.com/product/10052926385801.html?utm_campaign=t_1001328990) and have been testing the auto solution dosing system which is supposed to automatically add solution at a rate of 1:200.

I have it all setup correctly as per the instructions and even installed a pressure regulator to ensure the water pressure stays within 0.1MPa - 0.4MPa as specified.

https://preview.redd.it/z4ctj5keh5n91.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4681c0c5b6472c63522a1a0ca8b6866e87dd4927

I've been testing with my own robot-compatible cleaning solution 1:200 concentrate which contains green colouring to verify correct dilution and I've noticed a wide range of dilution rates mixed by the dock. 

The image below left shows the raw concentrate as added to the dock, then second left is the concentrate manually diluted with 200 parts water for reference, and the third left shows a very weak dilution I got from the robots tank when beginning testing.

https://preview.redd.it/owefear0h5n91.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc831ce48c8d4e096495fd203baf81c5f90ee404

I ran the Mop Wash in Balanced Mode another 6 times in a row and sampled the water from the robot tank each time after (front row) and also the dirty water output (back row), with the colours showing a wide range of dilution. *Note the dock did not need to purge its waste tank or refill its internal water reservoir every time (only 2 out of every 3 times) hence two of the back cups are empty.*

I think the problem is that while the Ultra dock is carrying out mop cleaning and refilling of the robot tank, if it senses the dock water reservoir is low, it will continue feeding water to the robot & mop wash while it first begins to refill the dock reservoir via the plumbed in water feed, then only after the dock water is full it then pumps a small amount of the cleaning solution to the same reservoir.

This means that if the dock is refilling at the same time that the robot mop is washing and robot tank is refilling (almost always), then for some time the robot will be getting supplied with basically plain tap water instead of of the correct 1:200 mix as advertised. This can then cause the next refill to have a higher concentration of cleaning solution etc.

I think the simple solution to this problem is for the dock to pause washing / refilling the robot while the dock reservoir is refilling. I see there is a micro USB port hidden under a rubber cover on the side of the dock addon so it presumably has capacity for a firmware upgrade.

**I hope someone in touch with Roborock China can bring this issue to their attention and see if there is a firmware fix available, as it's fundamental to effectiveness of this addon whether you're using Roborock solution or not.**

It would also be possible to carry out further testing to measure the exact dilution rates generated by using a brine based solution or something, which I'm surprised Roborock don't seem to have done else they would have quickly discovered the issue."
"[Feature Suggestion] Battery protection feature# TL;DR; Limit battery charge to a selectable range between 70-85 % to extend the battery life of the vacuum and also limit the lowest allowed battery charge between 15 and 30%.

**Explanation:** So Li-Ion batteries wear down a lot less when they have charge between 30 and 70%. This is the sweet spot for them and it causes less wear. Charging from 0 to 20 and from 70 to 100 causes a lot more wear, because of chemical reactions in the battery. Since the battery is not easily replacable in the vacuums I suggest there should be an option to limit the lowest charge % from 15 to 30% and highest charge from 70 to 85%.

This feature would be quite handy if the vacuum can clean the whole area with single charge and still limit the max charge on the battery. It's a win-win situation in my opinion and the feature can be implemented with a simple firmware upgrade.

"Anyone wish they could “plumb” their auto-wash-fill dock to autofill and autodrain the water tanks?I’m amazed at how well this thing works. Cleaner floors then when the cleaners come, It’s just an awesome device. I don’t mind emptying the dirty water tank and refilling the clean water tank, but if it were possible to actually plumb the dock in to a constant supply of freshwater, and a constant drain so that those tanks never needed emptying and refilling, I would find a way to do it.

I guess another option would be for Roborock to release larger - much larger - clean water and dirty water tanks. Considering there’s no limitation on how tall the tanks could be, I wonder if it would be possible for them to re-design and offer replacement tanks that had a much greater capacity to hold clean water and dirty water."
The NA bagless dustbin has arrived!
"S7 MaxV Ultra Does Not Auto Empty Dustbin After Vacuum Task - When is auto-emptying supposed to occur?Technical question for the true Roborock nerds out there.  Google can't seem to find any similar issues (search results dominated by unsuccessful auto-empty attempts - my problem is with INITIATING auto-empty)

Recently replaced an S6 with an S7 MaxV Ultra (with the Empty Wash Fill Dock).  So far, it's mostly been working great and meeting our expectations.  The mopping was only a ""nice to have"" feature (but I am rapidly growing to appreciate it more).  The key is not having to manually empty the tiny dustbin 4-6 times per session.  We have lots of hairy pets, and in the past if we didn't really stay on top of things during a cleaning, the vacuum bin intake would jam with hair, and we might find half the house never actually got vacuumed (due to the hair clog) because we got distracted by something and forgot to constantly check the dustbin levels.  First-world problem, but surprisingly annoying after a while.

The routines and tasks are a major component of what makes the S7 MaxV great, but I've been noticing that the vacuum does not always auto-empty the dustbin in between vacuuming tasks.

Some background on my setup:

I have my house mapped and broken into rooms specifically sized to be well within the capacity of the vacuum dustbin.  In other words, small enough that the dustbin should never jam under normal circumstances.  I'd rather have the vacuum return for auto-empty more often than reduce cleaning efficiency or (worse) jam something in the docking station because it tried to suck out too much at once.

I have daily routines built within the app.  Some involve separate vacuum and mopping tasks, others a string of vacuum-only tasks.  For today, I had a routine scheduled that looks something like this:  
Task 1: Room A, Turbo Vacuum

Task 2: Room B, Turbo Vacuum

Task 3: Room C, Turbo Vacuum

Today I watched the vacuum return to the docking station between tasks, charge for a few seconds, then start the next task.  I was under the impression that the vacuum should auto-empty the dust bin between vacuuming tasks, but this doesn't seem to be happening.  I know that the auto-docking is successful between tasks.  I know the auto-empty works because it I can hear it happening occasionally (at least once per routine - need to pay closer attention to determine if it is ONLY at the end of each routine).

Other days I have routines similar to this:

Task A: Room A, Turbo Vacuum

Task B: Room A, Intense/Deep Mop

Task C: Room B, Turbo Vacuum

Task D: Room B, Intense/Deep Mob

On these days I'll notice the vacuum return to the dock after a vacuum task, dock for a few seconds, then start the following mop task by leaving the dock, turning around, and backing in for the mop clean before mopping.  All without emptying the dust bin after the vacuum task.

Today I called Roborock customer support to ask if the dustbin auto-empty is supposed to automatically occur when the vacuum returns to the dock after a vacuum TASK, or if that only happens at the end of a ROUTINE that included a vacuuming task.  The gentlemen I spoke to said he wasn't sure and took my email - hopefully the development team will get back to me.

If auto-emptying is supposed to occur at the end of every vacuum task (even if it's the 3rd task in a 6-task routine), then there is a problem with either my vacuum, the app, or both.

If auto-empty is only supposed to occur at the end of every routine, then that is an unfortunate limit on using the vacuum to its fullest potential.

The great thing about auto-empty after vacuum TASKS are that they are sequential.  I can have many strung together in a routine, emptying after each room, secure in the knowledge that the vacuum isn't driving around with a clogged dustbin intake and only pretending to clean.  If a task is interrupted to clean a sensor or remove a jam (even if it takes 30 minutes for me to notice), the routine just keep going until all tasks are finished or the battery reaches 20%.

If auto-empty only occurs after a ROUTINE ends, that is more problematic.  It means I have to have more routines with fewer tasks to ensure the bin is emptied more often.  The issue is that routines have to be scheduled, and if a routine is still running when the next one is supposed to start, then that next routine gets skipped.  Not the same sequential flexibility as tasks.  The next routine won't just start later if needed (like tasks do).  This is a much less efficient way to schedule the vacuum, since you have to spread the routines out with enough ""buffer"" so that the next one doesn't get skipped if the previous routine runs long for some reason.  I want to concentrate the vacuum cleaning to certain time windows, not have it executing spaced-out routines spread out over most of a day because that's the only reliable way I can get the dustbin auto-emptied between rooms.

Anyone else out there having this problem?  Is there some task creation / routine scheduling element I am missing?  Some known bug with a workaround?

Today I had to manually empty the dustbin after my vacuum struggled through 3 rooms (each a separate task) without an auto-empty - the dustbin was totally clogged with hair and not effectively cleaning when I shook it out over the trash can.  Preventing this is a major part of why I decided to upgrade in the first place."
"Returns to dock at 20% batter level, how to lower that percentage?My robot returns to dock when it still has 20% battery left. I like to change that value to e.g. 5%.

Could somebody advise how that is achieved?

**Edit: It seems the 20% value is locked in.  I find this misleading as the actual/practical capacity is now 20% less as advertised. My/your phone is also not shutting down at 20% and your electric car will also not shut down until its battery is depleted.**

"Roborock s6 MaxV DiY repair help.Hi Reddit, trying to repair my left wheel in my roborock s6 maxv. Can’t find tutorials on YouTube or Google. Warranty has ended. i own two of these s6 maxv for a while now. Roborock support points to local seller for support. Local store says buy a new one cuz it will take a long time to fix. Lol. S7 looks fancy with the new station dock but I have two of these s6 maxv, one for upstairs and one downstairs in my house. Both have the Same issue, left wheel short circuit error. Seems like a common error posted online. It feels like the left gearbox/wheel is completely stuck. No give when turning the wheel with hand. 

I have dissembled almost everything I can, trying to reach the pin? The control arm? The metal thing that holds the wheel in place (seem picture), there is a spring holding the wheel on the back, no luck accessing that control arm. 

One the side there is transparent plastic screen, I think protecting some led lights/infrared lights? For the sensors. I think Im suppose to remove that, to access the control arm and knock it out with a hammer and another pin lol. 

To remove that plastic screen feels like I’m breaking it. So I’ve stop there. Looking for help and affirmation before I continue. Anyone have experience fixing the wheel? Tried searching online, no luck. 

Thanks in advanced. Pictures below. 

Extra rant. I feel the s6 maxv was intentionally made difficult to repair compared to the previous generations/models of roborock.  These robots have made my daily cleaning chore much easier. Bought the maxv for its big water capacity. S6/s5 base model looks so easy to diy repair in comparison. Going by utube disassembly videos.

TLDR
Left wheel stuck, short circuit error on app. Trying to diy repair, got stuck, looking for help. Need some one with experience. ELI5

"move to next room button ....I would want a skip to next room in cycle, because apparently these robots which do boundary cleaning suddenly loose that capacity.
For the times when a part of a room which was accessible earlier, becomes inaccessible later in de cycle.   

 I don't get it, if it detects an issue why can't this do a complete boundary run again and if it didn't reach that part , just skip it 
No  it needs to run from left to right a billion times.  You should have realised by now you can't get there.  

*Queue frozen music*. Let it go , let it go , you can't reach that part of the room any mooooore .........

It's cleaning for 48 mins in a room that takes 20ish normally."
"French Review of the S7 MaxV Ultra[Here's the original, click for pictures](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/roborock-s7-max-v-ultra-p66755/test.html)

Google translated:

 **Roborock's S7 MaxV Ultra prides itself on being one of the most autonomous robots on the market.** **Delivered with an imposing base comprising three bins, it vacuums, washes, empties its collector and automatically cleans its mop.**

## Presentation

The S7 MaxV Ultra is a hybrid robot vacuum for vacuuming and mopping the floor. Even better, Roborock presents it as an almost autonomous device. Sold at €1399, it is the “ultra” of the range which, delivered with a charging station, relieves the user of less than stellar tasks. Composed of three bins, the base empties the waste collector, fills the robot's water tank if necessary and keeps the soiled one after cleaning. Originality of the product, this station is automatically responsible for washing its tray and mop. And to achieve unparalleled cleaning performance, the manufacturer has equipped its robot with sensors, a rangefinder, a camera, a 3D scanner and a mop with sonic vibrations.

&#x200B;

 

## Convenience of use (5 stars)

Roborock's latest has a futuristic look. Dressed in black and red, it measures less than 10 cm in height. Above all, the S7 MaxV Ultra is a compendium of technologies, and it shows! It is thus equipped with ReactiveAI 2.0 technology combining an RGB camera and a 3D scan. This would allow the robot to find its way around its environment and detect obstacles in its path. Its laser rangefinder helps it correctly map the environment and optimize the route. Finally, the S7 MaxV Ultra obviously has an armada of sensors to detect different types of surface, obstacles or prevent it from falling into the void in the presence of a staircase, for example. Thanks to these technologies, the navigation of the robot should be among the best.

 If Roborock communicates a lot about these many technologies, the charging station remains the major asset of the S7 MaxV Ultra; imposing with its 49 cm in height and 42 cm in depth and width. It thus makes it possible to minimize the maintenance carried out by the user. To do this, it carries three different bins. Two are intended for the washing function: one must be filled with clean water, while the second collects dirty water after washing.

 Concretely, the base automatically fills the water tank integrated into the robot (200 ml), wrings the mop during and after washing, then stores the soiled water in the second tank. If the [Yeedi Mop Station](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/robot-laveur-sol/yeedi-mop-station-p64729/test.html) and the [Dreame Bot W10](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/robot-laveur-sol/dreame-w10-p67407/test.html) also have bins of this type, they do not have a collector drain container. The base of Roborock – and this is the originality of the robot – is equipped with it. It is therefore no longer necessary to get your hands dirty to empty the collector. But the manufacturer does not stop there and has equipped the S7 MaxV Ultra with an automatic self-cleaning system on its base after a session.

Continuing around the owner, we spot the waste collector under the carcass of the S7 MaxV. With a capacity of 400 ml, it has a HEPA filter that traps small dust and thus reduces the risk of allergy or asthma. A large rubber brush and a small side brush, combined with a suction power of 5100 Pa, are responsible for sucking up waste and dust.

 The mop attaches under the robot and goes into the washing machine. As for the water tank, it is clipped to the back and it allows you to moisten the vibrating mop.

 Finally, we identify the control panel located on the cover of the robot. Very classic, it allows you to start a cleaning, pause it, send the S7 MaxV back to its base or ask it to undertake a targeted cleaning.

 

### Connectivity and app

The Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra pairs easily with the app. After searching for the device on the latter, a QR Code appears and must be flashed by the robot's camera: it connects to wifi and becomes operational.

The user is then offered a plethora of functionalities. Of course, it is possible to ask the robot to start cleaning, to pause it or to return to its base. The mop's suction and “rubbing” intensities can be adjusted according to the chosen mode: vacuuming and washing, vacuuming or washing. As with many robot vacuums, the Roborock app allows you to create virtual walls, no-go zones, cleaning zones and even customize rooms from A to Z. In short, the user is king.

The possible settings are so numerous that it is difficult to detail them all. The user can choose how often the mop is washed, enable or disable automatic bin emptying, or schedule sessions. The multi-stage option is also available and is very valuable.

As with the [Samsung Jetbot AI+](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/samsung-jet-bot-ai-vr50t95735w-wa-p65705/test.html) , the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra's on-board camera lets the user see what's going on at home. It is then possible to follow a cleaning in progress, to control the robot remotely using a remote control and even to call the robot! The user can then communicate with people nearby or with his pet.

The app provides a very complete experience, especially since the details of the mapping are really appreciable: the robot identifies the obstacles (an icon identifies them on the map), the different surfaces (such as carpets) and grays out the clusters of waste (such as our sawdust).

## Maintenance (4 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra's docking station is supposed to be very self-contained, but the facts diverge somewhat. First of all, we noticed that the automatic draining of the collector was far from efficient. After initiating our cleaning session, the robot returns to its base, which in turn sucks up the collected waste. We then manipulated the robot and noticed that waste was escaping from the collector. To find out for sure, we placed 150 g of rice in the belly of the device, then ordered to empty its collector automatically. Only 26.3 g of rice were sucked up… We repeated the operation with 50 g of sawdust this time. The results are then better, but unequivocally: only 30 g were recovered by the suction base.

The automatic mop cleaning is also somewhat disappointing. During cleaning and at the end of the cycle, the base of the Roborock takes care of cleaning the mop thanks to an integrated brush. Alas, the results remain mixed and we prefer to put the wipe in the washing machine for more efficiency (60°C for a perfect result).

In the same way, the base is supposed to clean itself, always using the brush. Despite this feature, we find the base plate very dirty after cleaning. In question, the many interstices present on the base.

The HEPA filter retains little dust. We weighed before/after sucking 20 g of cocoa. In the end, only 0.2g got into the filter.

We should also point out the efficiency of the automatic filling of the water tank integrated into the robot. Thanks to its clean water tank, the base fills it as soon as necessary, which allows the S7 MaxV Ultra to gain autonomy.

Finally, the rubber brush avoids the entanglement of hair and hair, knowing that a small tool is delivered with the robot to improve maintenance.

## Navigation system (4 stars)

As we have previously reported, the S7 MaxV Ultra is a compendium of technologies. Its sensors, its laser rangefinder and its pair of cameras should allow it to locate itself perfectly in any type of environment.

 We therefore wanted to verify Roborock's claims and scattered 100 g of sawdust in strategic places in our laboratory. The trajectory of the robot is strange: it sometimes cuts the room in two, sometimes lingers on the carpet. Either way, it circles the area first before zigzagging around.

Then comes the first difficulty: our fine carpet. It's a success: the robot passes over the carpet without difficulty and does not forget to raise its mop to avoid soaking it. Ditto, the chair bars are not obstacles for the S7 MaxV Ultra. On the other hand, it bypasses the curtains without going under them and considers them as walls.

We then decide to place objects in its path to observe its behavior. The S7 MaxV Ultra would indeed be able to recognize shoes, cables and even animal feces. Above all, the manufacturer ensures that his machine reacts differently according to what he perceives. The robot vacuum cleaner would approach shoes, but stay away from excrement, for example. Obviously, we did not carry out this test, but placed a water bottle, a tea towel and a power cable. Apart from the water bottle, the robot dragged the obstacles in its path, which is a bit disappointing given the promise.

Finally, we place the robot in the dark. A front light comes on to light the way. Its route is quite methodical, but the robot seems to take detours from time to time and sometimes finds itself in difficulty in the face of certain obstacles.

## Suction (4 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra has a suction power of 5100 Pa (pascals), a wide brush and a side brush. This trio gives hope for more than adequate suction performance. This was the case on hard ground and fine carpet, in boost or normal mode.

On thick carpet, however, the test thickens. The device manages to collect 70% of the scattered rice in normal mode and 72% in boost mode. If this coating is particularly difficult for robot vacuum cleaners, this Roborock does not stand out on this test. For comparison, the [Dreame L10 Pro](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/dreame-l10-pro-p64593/test.html) , one of the last tested by *Les Numériques* , had sucked up 82% of the waste.

We tested the S7 MaxV Ultra as a robot vacuum, not a floor scrubber. The procedure therefore does not include washing efficiency. However, Roborock's strong communication around the versatility of the device prompted us to double down on our testing. Find the results in the news lab link.

## Autonomy (5 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra ranks in the middle of our [comparison](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/comparatif-choisir-meilleur-aspirateur-robot-a1555.html) and requires just over 3 hours to fully recharge. In standard mode, the robot is placed in the high average and vacuums for 2 h 51 min. It is also one of the longest-lasting devices in boost mode since it cleans for 1 hour 40 minutes.

## Noise (2 stars)

If it does not break the ears, the robot is not the quietest. In standard mode, it reaches 62 dB (A) against 54 dB (A) for the [iRobot Roomba J7+](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/irobot-roomba-j7-p64987/test.html) . The robot vacuum even goes up to 66 dB (A) when set to its maximum power.  

## STRONG POINTS

* Good suction performance.
* Quick recharge time.
* Good autonomy.
* Full app.
* Automatic filling of the water tank integrated into the robot.

## WEAK POINTS

* Improving obstacle management.
* Sloppy 2-in-1 features.

 

Conclusion (5 stars):

**The S7 MaxV Ultra is presented by Roborock as a hybrid device capable of vacuuming, washing and automatically managing its maintenance.** **However, if the suction performance is more than correct, there is a downside.** **The docking station is indeed very messy and does not manage to clean itself, whether at the level of its base, its mop or concerning the emptying of the collector.** **The vibrating mop, it (and like on many other devices), is only figurative.** **The S7 MaxV Ultra is certainly an excellent vacuum cleaner, but seems to rush its other features.** **It is therefore far from being considered a 2-in-1 robot worthy of the name.**"
"S7 Auto-Empty Dock JammedI've had my auto empty dock for a couple weeks. The first few times it ran, it did great - completely emptied the dust bin. Then I got a message saying the Auto Empty Dock was jammed. I turned the S7 over and sure enough, there was a big clump of hair (I have 2 dogs -  a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Boxer) that I removed. Removed that clump and figured all would be good. Ran it the next day and got the same error, only this time it didn't even try to empty the bin and there was no clump under the S7. I looked at the chute under the dock and it's clear. I took the bag out and it's got plenty of room. I removed a little hair from the chute into the bag and tried it again - same error. I removed the filter and there was nothing on it. So now I'm guessing there is hair somewhere between the chute under the dock and before the bag. 

&#x200B;

So my question is, is there a way to remove the housing the filter sits in so I can clean around that? I don't know where else the clog could be. The S7 is clear from the bin to the roller, the bag has capacity left, there's nothing in the chute that I can feel at the bag inlet and the filter is clean so it has to be from the bottom up to the bag.

Any help is appreciated

So... Why doesn't all of them have the European hybrid version?

I live in Europe, so if this is true I'm very happy. I understand that there might be some issues considering HEPA filter etc. with going bag-less, also a bit more messy when emptying. But all in all I feel that bagless is the more environment friendly, considering you already have to replace filters and brushes etc.

"Roborock S5 Max power consumption in kWh?I'm trying to find out the power consumption of the Roborock S5 Max. The manual says:

* Robot: 58W
* Base charging: 28W
* Base idle: 3W (thanks /u/chizburger/)
* Time for a full charge: 6 hours

&#x200B;

Making a dumb calculation:

* Base charging the robot (1 full charge/day): 28W / 1000 = 0.028 kWh \* (6 hours \* 30 days) = 5.04 kWh/month
* Base idle (24 hours - 6 hours of actual use): 3W / 1000 = 0.003 kWh \* (18 hours \* 30 days) = 1.62 kWh/month
* Robot is used 3h (the maximum battery capacity) every day, hence the full charge every day.

I woke up, and checked and it's at 100% , when i open the mi home app, i can see it has done partially tasks (prior to battery draining) and the map shows my zones which are yet to be cleaned .  So it hasn't auto resumed.  Is there settings that i have to choose for it to auto resume after it's charged ?"

"Roborock S6 First ImpressionsI received my S6 yesterday and ran it for the first time today. Maybe it’s partly the general fascination, but wow do I already love this thing! I was completely prepared to go with the S5 Max, but an amazon sale put them at about the same price, so I went with the S6 for the slightly quieter rating and slightly larger dust bin. This subreddit helped greatly in my research, so I thought I’d contribute my two cents as well. Long post ahead...

Context:
Per the roborock app the little dude mapped and cleaned 764 sq ft in 79 minutes, consuming about 46% of the battery in balanced mode. Our house is very compartmentalized, with doorway sized entries between the living room, kitchen, and hallway, with 3 bedrooms and 2 small bathrooms. No stairs, all hardwood with a few small low-pile area rugs. I have long hair, a dog that sheds constantly, and a bird that spreads fluff and seeds all around. 

Key points:
- Pretty impressed with its initial mapping. Watching it navigate around corners and table legs and gently bump around stray shoes was a thing of beauty. It did try for a while to get out the front door. Maybe because we had it open to  the all-glass storm door and it could “see” the front porch? It eventually gave up and moved on. 

- Very satisfied with the noise level on balanced mode. We’re currently working from home and wanted something that wouldn’t be intrusive. Definitely quieter than a normal vacuum and easy to ignore. I wouldn’t want it running in the bedroom at night, but cleaning the rest of the house overnight probably wouldn’t be an annoyance. 

- It cruised right onto all the area rugs, including our currently unsecured doormat that slides around if you breathe on it. I could hear the suction amp up for carpet mode each time. 

- It picked up all visible debris, a ton of hair and dust bunnies. The side brush didn’t seem to fling anything too far. 

- It did get hung up on a few cords and shoe laces, mostly my fault for not picking them up, but definitely something to keep in mind. 

- We haven’t vacuumed for about a week prior to this, and the dust bin was completely full by the end. As such I would say the last room may not have been cleaned as thoroughly, but it’s also the least used room so I couldn’t see a visibly lower performance there. I’m fully confident if run a few times a week the dustbin capacity should be just fine.

- There was also a ton of hair wrapped around the side brush, but didn’t stop it from spinning. The main brush had minimal hair wrapped up in it, less than our normal vacuum. 

- It did have trouble finding the dock when finished. It made weird laps around every room on the way back for about 10 minutes. I finally paused it, put it a foot in front of the dock and resumed, and it found it then. 

Overall I’m really happy with the first run. No mopping yet but we’ll give that a whirl soon enough!"
"S4-Experiencing a new bug...Map Loading... But it does not.In recent days I've started to have trouble downloading the current map from the vaccum. Once that happens I can no longer interact with the map or schedule room cleaning. I have restored previous Maps but that only works for a little while and then I end up with the map loading screen again. I contacted customer service but they have only asked a couple of questions so far with no recommendation on what to do next. So today I hit the reset button and restored the prior map and began a cleanup. About three-quarters of the way through I got the map loading screen again. I also try clearing the app cache as well.


Any thoughts on what might be a next step? Should I factory reset the vacuum? Should I uninstall the app all together?

Edit: I un-installed the app and reinstalled . No improvement.

Update: this morning I woke up and was able to load the map but after running a cleaning cycle, the map stopped updating towards the end of the run. When I exited the app and came back in I got the map loading error screen again. Whatever is happening seems to take place towards the end of the cleaning run.

Update 2: Roborock finally recommended something...factory reset. I'm going to try the app on an ios device first but after that I'm going to reset.

Update 3: The same problem persisted after I factory reset my unit. Roborock now claims that my 3600 square feet home is too big for their vacuum! Customer support said that although it may have worked in the past they will be frequent problems with map loading. I told them that I've owned 3 roborock vacuums and this is the first time that I have ever heard of this problem before. I gave them my Amazon order number and I'm processing warranty claim.

Update 4: things are starting to take a turn for the worst because they are saying that my house is too large and that it stated on their main website so that they don't have to replace it entirely. They are offering me a partial credit. I told them that the total home is split into two levels so my main floor doesn't exceed their hidden maximum map size. Still waiting on an answer but starting to feel like the customer service is not being very supportive here.

Update 5: Customer service finally acknowledged that the unit might be defective and has offered to repair it. It is being shipped to California now. The problem seems to be when the unit completes a cleaning cycle the saved map will not load. This prevents me from using the room cleaning scheduling and spot cleaning. If I had to guess I suppose it's a storage related problem but support didn't have a clue.

Support is kind of a hassle with no single person handling your question. I must have had about five or six people jump in any given day to ask me to try something else or a question about my home.

Update 6: roborock support sent me a refurbished unit yesterday. I ran a cleaning cycle and watched as the map was created until the robot reached 20% charge and then it docked itself. Once the charge was restored to 80% it went back out again to finish the cleaning. When the cleaning cycle was completed, I was once again faced with a map loading Screen. No map would load although the history of the run is stored. Same bug, different unit. What the heck is going on?

Update 7: OK I think I finally fixed the problem. It appears that placing the vacuum in a more central part of the home fixed the issue. I'm not sure why but I read that this fixed someone else's issues so I decided to give it a try, not having much hope. For some reason this seems to be the magic bullet although it wasn't the problem before or for my original xiaomi roborock. I wonder if the S4 doesn't have the memory capacity to track all the back-and-forth Motions required when the vacuum is located at one end of the house. Perhaps this is just a bug introduced in the latest firmware."
Upgrade water tank on S5/S6?I have the Roborock S6 which is the best robot vacuum I have ever owned or played with (I had a few Roomba including S9+ and a last-gen Neato). The one thing I wish I could do with the S6 is increase the capacity of the water tank to S5 Max or larger capacity. I wonder if anyone has made 3rd-party attachments that would hold extra water off the back of the robot similar to how the S5 Max increased it's capacity 2x over the S5/S6?
Can someone comment on the obstacle avoidance performance of the new S7 Max Ultra?I see a difference with the MaxV. Is it a big difference?
"Does anyone else dont like the carpet performance of Roborock S7 rollers?The older models had the brush with bristles which leaves a nice pattern on the carpet. This doesnt leave as much and hair doesnt get sucked in as much.

I hear Q7 rollers work on this model but hard to find em in Australia.

Anyone from down under trying out different rollers?

"Performance Issue ResolvedI just want to share this since others are probably experiencing this. I have an S7 MaxV and an S4 MaxV. I also have 2 dogs and one sheds year round regardless of outside temperature (Corgi). I noticed both of my vacuums weren’t picking up as much as typical. The S4 kept saying the filter is clogged or wet. Both vacuums also seemed to be working harder than before. I have an air compressor, but a can of compressed air from a box store should work as well. I used my air compressor to blow air backward through the exhaust to clear anything in there. A tuft of dog air mixed with dust flew out of the S7. First run after filled the bin. It also sounded much quieter, not working as hard. S4 isn’t griping about the filter being clogged. 
Hope it helps!"
"S7 MaxV performance degradationHey everyone,

I have noticed lately that the cleaning (vacuuming) performance of my Roborock has decreased noticeably. It is quite obvious as I have two dogs and in the beginning it was a miracle how good that thing was.

Do you think this might be caused by the nearing end of life of the brushes or might it be something else?

EDIT: I have changed both brushes + the HEPA filter (mine was rather new and when changing, looked like it could work some more time) and seems things got back to normal"
"The New Roborock Q Revo is an Outstanding Value! Full ReviewHey all,

I don't normally post my video links here, however since there are not a bunch of review videos out and today is the last day for the $225 off coupon I thought I would share my findings with you all.  I did not say it in the video, but with the coupon this thing is an insane value with nothing even close to it on the market, price and performance wise.  I think that may even hold true without the coupon.  The main drawback is marginal object avoidance, which I hope can be fixed by Roborock with firmware updates.  I am working with them to get it resolved.

"Awful customer serviceI know this will probably get down voted since Roborock is a very beloved company on this forum, but would like to share my experiences anyway. Hoping it helps others.

I have seen numerous posts on here about people having their S7 scratch their floors, I have always had a blind eye to this as I never had any visible (to my eye) scratches with mine. Recently i have been hearing what sounds like ""scrapping"" happening on my floor. Upon further inspection I noticed I have all kinds of ""surface scratches that show up in just the right light on my floors. (not happy....)

From here I inspected the bottom of my vac and noticed on my plate that holds in the brush, near the wheels there are very heavy worn away plastic tabs. From here I place a couple of felt pads on these areas and no longer heard any scraping of any sort on a run.

Upon further investigation I found that you can replace these plates for $20 on Amazon which in the description they state. (rubber pads prevent floor scratches).

Now my issue is, nowhere in the maintenance does it mention I need to or should look out for this at any time. I never knew I should have been worried about replacing this or it going ""bad"".

When i call Roborock , they completely deny any of this and state that only the wheels touch the floor and it would be impossible for their product to scratch the floor. After multiple attempt's. They literately blocked my number! I know this cause when i try to call the main number on my main phone, the call no longer goes through, when i used my work phone it works just fine.

I will say this, they make wonderful performing vacs and their app is top notch. As a for their customer service, they are just awful!

I think my next step is to form up enough evidence and file a complaint with BBB."
"Maxv ultra - Disappointed with vacuum performance on carpet even with Q5 brush vs DeebotH, I had a Deebot T8AIVI in the past and after each vacuum run on my high pile carpet, I was impressed by how much fiber and dirt it picked.  I recently upgraded to maxV ultra since it does both carpet and floor in the same run, but am really disappointed by how little the dust bin gets filled with similar carpet run.  I even changed the brush to the Q5 brush and still similar performance!  The bin looks almost empty.  Has anyone faced similar problem or just me doing something wrong, or do I have a defective unit?

Thanks"
"Worse performance over time?When I got this eobot nearly 2 years ago, I was amazed on how good its mappi g and algo was navigating it through tight spaces.

Now after some time of updates, I have noticed that its not cleaning underneath certain furniture, as its not fitting in anymore, but it did at the beginning and I was amazed that it did.

Did the algorithms got worse over time, or is there some settings between fast and slower but more detailed cleaning routing?

Also, does anyone have any idea how to stop my 5max to stop getting stuck those metal cloth hangers?"
"Let's talk: who's going to take over the crown in robotic vacuums?First off let's just get this out of the way: we all love our Roborocks here. Tech wise they're unbeatable...but, I think we can also all agree that their QA and customer service is awful, so much that I'm sure a great many of us don't have faith in the longevity of our purchases.

The field is also getting more competitive. Where it used to be iRobot or Roborock we're now seeing Ecovacs, Shark, Eufy, Dyson, etc. all throw their names in the hat. 

Sooner or later, one of these companies are going to catch up to RRocks performance, and even if they're ALMOST there, their QA and customer service could potentially sway a buyer in their direction.

So I ask...who do you think is the closest to achieving the goal? For me it feels like Ecovacs."
"Roborock S7 MaxV human/pet hair pickup performance?I’m currently deciding between the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra and the Roomba J7+. I really like the mopping and self clean ability of the Roborock, but every video I’ve seen has shown poor performance of hair pickup from carpet. The Roomba doesn’t have a good mopping kit, and the navigation is not as good as roborock’s, but the hair performance seems miles better on carpet.

I know of that several S7 owners have replaced the rubber roller brush with the Q5 brush, and that seemed to improve the carpet hair pickup performance. I was wondering if this would be comparable to the Roomba carpet performance after the Q5 brush change. Does anyone have insight into this?

Primarily concerned with my own hair (long) and two ragdolls cats who will be coming early next year. Ragdoll hair seems particularly long compared to the average cat. If I had no carpet I would definitely get the Roborock but as of now, I’m leaning towards the Roomba based on the carpet hair performance.

My apartment is around 900 sqft with 50/50 carpet and hardwood."
"Roborock S7 carpet performanceI'm looking for some advice here.  I got an S7 a couple weeks ago and I love pretty much everything about it but the performance on carpet, even on the highest setting seems weak.  I swapped out the brush for the Q5 brush and that seems to offer a bump in improvement.  My old neato D7 can come out after my S7 has run and still pick up nearly an entire dustbin.  Is this just the case on carpet or is there another brushroll that someone would recommend or maybe my machine has suction issues.  Hopefully I'm not offending any current users as I do agree the software is vastly superior to my Roomba S9 and Neato D7."
"s7 max ultra / s7 pro ultra / s7 maxv ultraGreetings,

I know that there are a lot of post explaining the differences between the s7 maxv ultra and s7 max ultra; but I'm not finding a lot info (if any info at all) when comparing this 3 options.  


I currently have a S5 (not the max version) for the last few years. It is a nice robot, but I feel it starts to get a little outdated when compared with the newer versions.  
I struggling to decide wich one to get - specially when there is also the Q Revo arriving soon. The S8 pro ultra will bet too expensive for me..  
Between this 3 (4, if counting the Q Revo) wich would be the best experience coming from the S5, considering:  
\- Vaccuming performance (I know more PASCAL doesn't always translate to more efficiency);  
\- Mopping ability (the S5 is very ""poor"" at this topic)  
\- Dock (auto empty, washing, refilling, drying, etc)  
\- Price :)  


Thanks in advance."
"Fellow Q Revo owners: tips/tricks/gripes?Big upgrade from my S4 Max but not perfect, obv. My dust bin emptying has been hit or miss and I'm not getting as close to the baseboards as I'd like. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Will hopefully dial that in with further use. 

Performance has been quite good though and I'm excited to begin using it on a daily basis.

Any other early thoughts or tips y'all want to share about your experiences with this new machine? Could be helpful to us and those considering a purchase. ✌️"
"New video comparing S7 MaxV Ultra to S8 Pro Ultra shows the S7 crushing it in every test? So confused...My S8+ is out for delivery from amazon today and a new video from The Hook Up drops with a big robot vacuum test comparing these and others: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ldZCNkksgw

Long story short in his testing the S8 looks like a downgrade in literally every way. I can pick up a S7 MaxV Plus for the same price as the S8+ but I supposed my question to existing owners is this:

Does roborock often improve the performance of their robots with firmware updates or is what you see on release pretty much what you get outside of bug fixes? For example, is it reasonable to expect the S8 obstacle avoidance to improve with time or not? I'm buying the + models here instead of the Ultra's because I have 0 use for a mop and these will be used mostly on carpet."
"Is it OK if I leave clean water in the clean water tank and clean water in robot?Will there be a difference old Vs new water? 

Will the performance affect?"
"Degraded mapsHas anyone else had issues with maps degrading over time?  My S7 started performing very erratically and the maps became warped.  If you look at the 1st pic you can see how the parallel walls don’t match up and the cleaning pattern got really weird.

I remapped the house and now it is doing great again.  Just curious who else has experienced this."
"Tempted to cancel S8 pro ultra order to wait for Q RevoI have been watching livestream robots comparisons on douyin (Chinese TikTok) recently and found they highly recommended Q Revo (P10 in China) over S8 pro (G20 in China) because Q Revo is much cheaper than S8 pro there with similar cleaning performance. Unfortunately not many Q Revo reviews on YouTube yet ([https://youtu.be/IGUW3Km03Eo](https://youtu.be/IGUW3Km03Eo)). 

All new models from dreame and Ecovacs added the wall edges cleaning feature by letting the robot wiggle its butt (the spinning mop part), seems roborock will also upgrade their app to add this feature to p10 (Q Revo) soon. If there is just another 1 to 2 months wait for Q Revo, I am wondering if I should wait for that."
"S7 MaxV Ultra vs S8 Plus / S8 Pro UltraPeople recommend the S8 series for Carpet, and S7 MaxV series for Hard Floors... I prioritize Carpet over Hard Floors... The answer was simple. Get the S8 Pro Ultra. But my budget slapped me and told me to get the S8 Plus instead. After I look deep about the S8\_P, notice S8\_P and S8\_PU feature isn't the same, and they are entirely two separate models, aka can not be compatible with the ""Pro Ultra"" dock, if I only get the S8 for example. --- 

&#x200B;

I seen many reviewers of the **S8 Pro Ultra**, but very rarely I seen people review or mention the specifics of the the **S8/S8 Plus** compared to the **S8 Pro Ultra**, from what I know now, the **S8/S8 Plus** is not compatible with the ""**Pro Ultra**"" dock, simply because they were designed different, so no dock upgrade future options like the **S7 MaxV series** if I were to get the **S8 Plus**.

&#x200B;

From *JamieAndrews* video result, despite the VibraRise 2.0 of the **S8\_PU**, it score disappointingly less than the **S7\_MVU** on Mopping performance. A minor difference with sand on floor, which **S7\_MVU** also wins, mainly due to how fast the **S8\_PU**'s side brush spinning speed. And lastly the S8\_PU wins of 4% difference against the S7\_MVU on Carpet set to Mode Max+. \[JamieAndrews  - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61KizLGAEhM)\]

From the result ranking of Deep Cleaning scores from *VacuumWars*, is that **S8\_PU** got 78% compared to **S7\_MVU** of 83%. As he did mentioned it might be because the lower airflow or simply an operator error on their part. \[VacuumWars - [Video](https://youtu.be/kNnI7JWn64A) / [Website](https://www.vacuumwars.com/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-review/)\]

From using my google sheets to make a full comparison from *CordlessVacuumGuide* mixed of results from the official site, the summary is that the **S8** only advantages are the dual roller brush and layout directions (make it go different patterns). On the other hand, the **S7MV** advantages are the better CFM aka airflow, slightly less loud than the s8(few db quieter), a detachable mop without the whole thing flipping over, suction is stronger for hair due to how the airflow is better, and the rest are about the same. **\[**CordlessVacuumGuide **-** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjUAffFb3Lo) / [Website](https://www.bestcordlessvacuumguide.com/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-vs-s7-maxv-ultra/)**\]**

I can't till which mode [**VacuumWars**](https://youtu.be/kNnI7JWn64A) and [**CordlessVacuumGuide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjUAffFb3Lo) use on their performance tests, so their comparison of performance is different interns of Carpet Deep Clean. But judging from VacuumWars' perspective, I can say that maybe because its their first gen, unlike Roomba's signature dual rollers, so the s8's lower deep clean score does make sense with that lower CFM airflow.

My final question comes down to ""S8 Plus or S7 MaxV Ultra?"""
S8 Pro Ultra Amazon order problemI just got this message regarding my S8 Pro Ultra order on Amazon. It's still in shipping and I expect to receive it in 1-2 days but don't get the reason for the message. Is there something defective with the first batch and they're just trying to get ahead of it to avoid mass returns to Amazon? Anyone else got a similar message?
"Is the higher pascals worth itI have the S7+ with the 2500 PA. Is the higher 5200PA in the S7 Max V Ultra worth the extra cost. Right now with promos the cost is double for the S7MaxVUltra . I also have a Roomba and find it does a better job at vacuuming. Simply because it has full bin sensor so it returns to the dock, empties then returns to the job. On those heavy hair days I'll send the Roomba and have the S7+ do the final clean up and mop.  I have two large house dogs. Mostly hard floors couple of area rugs. Don't vacuum everyday but typically every other day and some days the hair is worst than others. No use to vacuum when the bin is full. That Roomba is on its final leg after 2 years. I hope the S7+ last longer. Was going to get another unit from Roborock just wasn't sure which unit to by. Pleased with the S7+ so far outperforms Roomba in every aspect except for auto empty bin when full. TIA"
"Is OMO cleaner 100% safe?Like I wanna buy a safe detergent. Meaning it **won't** affect my robot or break it, or lose any performance. Roborock recommends OMO liquid, whatsoever if I use it vs don't, will it affect performance if I would? Or it is 100% safe and it doesn't matter..."
"S7 MaxV Ultra Omo cleaning fluid performance experiencesGood evening everyone,

Does anyone have any first hand experience with the official Omo/roborock cleaning fluid in a S7 MaxV Ultra (or similar)?

Looking forward to hearing about your experiences!

"S8 owners, how effective is double brush so far?Ive been seeing conflicting videos about how well the dual brush roll performs. Even Vacuum Wars remarked on how disappointing the feature is.

"Q Revo On Carpet?How would Q Revo perform on medium pile carpet?

I've never had a robot vacuum and was stalking Roborock's IG for the S8 with dual rollers--but the price tag..🫠 

I have a ragdoll and a maine coon, and im hoping for some maintenance during the week on their shedding/not having hair clumps everywhere. I do a deep vacuum and deshed on the weekend. 

I'm mostly seeing info about its mopping capabilities but only 1/4 of my house needs mopping. Would this still be 'worth it' if my main concern is the carpet?

It seems Roborock is worth diving into robot vacuums for, just trying to see if im delusional with the medium pile 🙏😅

"Seeking Recommendations for First Robot Vacuum (S7 MaxV, S8 or... S8 Ultra Pro)Greetings, Roborock community!

I'm excited to venture into the world of robot vacuums and would greatly appreciate your assistance in selecting the perfect model for my needs. Here are the key points to consider:

1. New to Robot Vacuums, I never owned one before!

2. Apartment Details: I live in a 65 sqm flat with a mix of carpets and hardwood floors. There are no pets in the household.

3. Top-Notch Performance: I'm looking for the best robot vacuum available in terms of both vacuuming and mopping capabilities.

4. Delaying Dock Purchase: Since this is my first robot vacuum experience, I'm hesitant to invest in a dock right away. I'd like to test the vacuum's performance and suitability before committing to a docking station.

5. Model Choices: After some research, I've narrowed down my options to the Roborock S8 and S7 MaxV. However, I'm hesitant about the S8 Ultra Pro, it feels really the best but it would force me to buy a dock right away and I would love to avoid that.

Given these considerations, I would greatly appreciate any tips, advice, or personal experiences you can share. Which model would you recommend based on my preferences?

Thanks!"
"I didn't realize I was a victim of Stockholm SyndromeI've been an iRobot customer for 6-7 years, running a 980 and a couple of i7+ bots, as well as one of the first mopping bots (Scooba, if I remember correctly--it was awful).  I've managed to work around their issues and have been generally satisfied with their performance.

Recently, I wanted a mopping bot and didn't like iRobot's offering, so I picked up an S7 MaxV Ultra off of Amazon yesterday.  I'm currently running it for the first time...

Some shockers for me:

* It actually docks on the first try
* It doesn't have to bump into walls/furniture to find them
* Real-time map updates on the app!
* Sensible, logical mopping/vacuuming
* It actually discovers all accessible spaces on its first run

It did get caught under a toe kick in my kitchen at one point, which threw off the map by about 3'.  Considering that it cleans without a map just fine, it's hardly a big deal that I'll have to redo mapping.  Were that the case with my i7+, it would be infuriating to start over again.

I never really realized what I was missing.  Thank you, Amazon, for buying iRobot and forcing me to look elsewhere."
"My first cleaning run!OK, I am highly amused watching this S7 go around the condo vacuuming & following on the map. So far, it's only tried to eat 2 cords. (My bad!)"
"Q5 brush tight fit on S7 MaxV?Anyone else that is using the Q5 brush on the S7 MaxV have it fitting as tight as mine does? 

As shown in the video, it doesn't spin as easily as the default brush without the bristles, and the left side takes a slight bit of pressure to fit in, whereas the default brush just falls in to place. I'm slightly worried about unnecessary stress on the motor using this, I did actually get a 'main brush jammed' error shortly after trying it too.. but was fine after taking it out and reinstalling it (there were no tangles) and letting it run for another hour without issue though.

What's yours like?"
"Is the roborock q5+ right for me?Hi fellow redditors!

I'm thinking of buying a roborock q5+, from the research I did it was the perfect model for me. It has a lidar sensor, amazing app, and no mop.

"8 Month Review of the Roborock S7 Maxx V UltraDisclosure: I'm sure how this thing runs on carpet. Every area of the house mine covers is tile and hardwood (around 400 square foot cleaning area). It cleans the mop twice during its scheduled cleanings before finishing. This review is only covering its cleaning quality and maintenance needed, not the added features that come with the bot. If there are any questions, feel free to ask. That being said, my own experience with the unit is very positive. 

I bought mine September, 2022 and it runs every night at 8 PM. I also have the dryer module to dry the mop pad after every scheduled cleaning - As long as I keep up with proper maintenance, she runs beautifully with no issues. Every three days, I need to add water and detergent  to the clean water bin and clean the dirty water bin on the docking station. I clean the dirty water filter weekly, robot sensors monthly, and clean the bot and docking station once every 3 months (quarterly). I ensure the vaccum channel in the dock remains clear as needed, and replace the mop pad, dock mop cleaning brush, robot side brush, vacuum spin brush, and air filter, and dust bag when prompted. Keeping extra parts and supplies for maintenance on hand is the way to go. 

***Pros/Cons:*** The maintenance is a bit tedious, but it's far better than sweeping and mopping my home daily. It's quality of work is good, but it struggles in some areas. Larger objects can jam the brush and it doesn't do well with thick grime or caked on dirt. Large wet/sticky messes like this have to be cleaned up with human labor. This thing is primarily built to handle dried debris like spilled cereal, potato chip fragments, short hair, and light grime like dirt scuffs on the floor. I do a brief FOD Walk (Foreign Object Damage) before every cleaning to make sure there's nothing on the floor that can jam the brush. I see this as a good thing as it keeps me more conscious of my house cleanliness, and it takes far less time than performing a full-on cleaning with a broom and mop. Hard to reach areas are very limited based on the robots size and maneuverability, so some areas like tight corners and narrow areas will be missed. 

In all, I'd say this robot is exceptional for what it was made for, but it does come with some work and maintenance.

1. If you're expecting something that can take care of everything for you, then you're expecting too much. It has its limitations as described above, so expect light duty cleaning in most cases. 

2. If you're expecting something that can fully take care of itself, then you're expecting too much. This thing WILL save you time and work, but only by a third of what you might expect. You'll have to keep up with some scheduled tasks to take care of it, and routine replacement parts will cost you some money as they wear."
"Give some credit to the cleaner of the bot, it is a regular detailed job !Our family's S5 max is working great, with all original parts, after 3 years. Light duty with two times a week vacuming of 1000 sq ft without any pets.

However I would like to take some credit for being thorough in cleaning it every  month (brush wash and drying, wheel cleaning, filter brushing, filter box wash, rotating pusher wash, device dusting and sensors).

Even though this procedure is essential in keeping it able to work correctly for a long time, I really feel I am at the bottom of the cleaning chain. And my lovely wife, naturally, is at the top of the cleaning chain since the only interaction is ""why did the robot not perform such a goog sweep ?"" LOL"
"Original accessories or fake onesWhich accessories for Roborock S7 maxv ultra, **shall be bought ""real""**, ftom Roborock shop. And which accessories can be bought cheaper ""fake one""?

I believe the roller brush (red one) should be real, as it can drastically change performance if bought cheap one.

The filter should also be bought ""original""

Side brushes can be bought fake??

Mop pads shall be bought original one? Im not sure cause I don't know if mopping cloth quality will do something.

Dustbags... Can these also be bought fake?? I believe you don't need the real one for that..

Guys what's y'all opinion on it? What do you think, what accessories can be bought fake, but **which accessories can't/shouldn't be bought real**? I wanna save money but i don't want so i lose performance.."
"Roborock S8 Pro Ultra “Cannot turn in - contact Roborock support”Just received the new Roborock S8 Pro Ultra today. 
Set it up, let it charge, installed newest firmware and then let it drive around to create the map. I set up and edited rooms. Then I sent it to vacuum the first room. 
It did all that perfectly well and returned to the base, cleaned the vacuum container and sat there to charge again.

Suddenly it announced per audio that it will perform a reset which will take five minutes.
I think this happened twice.

Since then the Roborock is offline in the app and and when trying to restart it it announces: “Cannot start, contact Roborock.”
The three LEDs in the front blink white until when left alone they go off and the middle power button blinks red.

Reset and Factory reset both did not achieve anything.
The robot will not start and the above message is voiced.

Anyone any ideas if this can be fixed or if it needs to be sent back to vendor?

Regards, Christian"
"Can't connect new S8 to Wi-Fi - S7 VMax Ultra works fineI just got my new S8 today but it won't connect to Wi-Fi. It gets to the step where it says the phone is connecting and I can see the phone switch to the S8's temporary Wi-Fi network, but then it fails. App works fine with the S7 VMax Ultra that I also got this week as I am comparing them to see which performs better."
"S7 MaxV - Docking a little crooked?Everything works great, and I can't praise this vac enough.  But recently I've noticed the MaxV not docking in straight.  It charges fine, I clean sensors and perform the other regular maintenance, it has no issue undocking and doing it's task - but I'm wondering if I've simply never noticed this, or is something screwy going on like a wheel slipping.

"Update on the new wheels for s5Hi everyone, I have put in the new wheels and did some comparisons. Old wheels 68mm at best and new wheels 71mm. Just 1.5mm makes a big difference. No more slipping while mopping. No more weird turns or backups in the middle of the floor. 

Easy job to do. 7 big screws on the bottom then 3 on each wheel. One is right down inside but still easy to access. Put the screws into the loops before you put the wheel back in. Tighten lightly. Put the backing plate on and add the 7 big screws. Tighten lightly. Rosie is back to normal. 

One suggestion I had was to just rough up the old tire but it is clearly worn down after the approximately 120pkm she has rolled in cleaning my place."
"Roborock S7 UltraHi,

Recently purchased one and it has worked great.  It is getting near that time to but a filter, and mop.

Roborock advises using their products.  Has anyone used the other brands found on Amazon and if so, any issues with them?

They seem to be quite a bit less and I wonder if there will be any performance degradation.

&#x200B;

thanks"
"Should I get the S8 Pro Ultra or just the base model S8 without the cleaning station?Hi folks, I am looking for a good quality robo vac that can do some decent mopping on top of vacuuming and based on the reviews it looks like the Roborock lineup of vacuums are pretty good. I am looking to get the new S8 model, as it has pretty much all the features of the S7 MaxV (obstacle detection, mopping etc). The S8 Pro Ultra seems to have slightly upgraded mopping functionality with two vibration areas, and of course has the self cleaning and emptying station. But based on the reported prices, it is significantly more expensive than the base S8. I am in UK and the easiest way to buy this for me is via German Amazon and I can get the base S8 for about £570. I am guessing the S8 Pro Ultra will be at least twice or even close to thrice in price when it is released soon. So, do you think it is worth the steep increase in price for the auto-cleaning station, or can I manage by cleaning and emptying the vacuum manually myself? Is the difference in cleaning performance between S8 and S8 Pro Ultra significant or just minor? 

Looking forward to your suggestions!"
"Best value for money model?Hi all,

I'm currently looking at the following EU prices and I wonder where the sweet spot would be in terms of performance / price.

Q7 Max+ for 499S7 Pro Ultra for 1099S7+ for 818

I'm strongly leaning towards the Q7 Max+ since i can hardly imagine that the better dock / mopping features of the S7 Pro Ultra make it worth almost 2x the price? Or am I missing something here that would really make the S7 that much more valuable? Curious to hear your thoughts.

Oh and as a sidenote, for a house with multiple floors, should I consider to buy multiple units or does carrying the robot from one floor to another work generally well?"
"Switch from iRobot S9/M6?I currently have a iRobot S9 and M6 combo. Both units are getting worn because they get used a lot. I am considering a switch to Roborock but need some advice to choose a model. 

A bit about my situation. 

I have a house around 1900 sqft with hardwood and low pile carpet. I also have two big dog( 90ish lbs) and they both shed A LOT but in different ways. Labrador (short fine hair) and Pyrenees (long strands that turn into fuff balls)  Lastly have a almost 2 year old toddler, and 1 month old twins. 

I need something that can be run very regularly (daily) to keep floor clean for twins so they don't end up in dog hair while also avoiding all the things that my toddler will leave around.

I am also a techie at heart so I like to try all the newest and greatest features. That being said I also need to see a Google home integration. 

My biggest complaints right now are the S9 is LOUD, and the mop is very annoying to keep filled and pad clean. Also nighttime performance on S9 is lackluster. 

Price is not a concern I can get whatever gets the job done. 

Would I be better of with S7 maxv ultra or S8 pro ultra or even waiting a bit for something better (S8 maxv???)"
"Does the S7 MaxV apply pressure on the mop?One of the features highlighted on the S8 line is that it'll apply 6 Newtons of pressure down on the mop to improve performance.

Does the S7 MaxV apply any pressure at all?

[The Roborock S7's site says that it applies 600 grams of pressure](https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s7-robot-vacuum-and-mop), but I haven't seen this confirmed on the S7 MaxV.

But now I'm all confused - assuming that the 600 grams of pressure carries over to the S7 MaxV, does the S8 line actually do much more? 6N of pressure = 611 grams. That's hardly notable."
"Time for some new kicks for the s5So I noticed my S5 has been doing some weird navigation behaviour. 

Strange circling or reserving in the middle of the floor with no obstructions. Jagged turns at the end of each cleaning run. Only when the mop is attached.

So but the bullet and grabbed a set of rubber for the old girl. A$53 from AliExpress.

Take care when installing the screw loops are small and easily cracked if happen to torque them down too hard. Ask me how I know!"
"Mopping performance: Q7 Max vs. S7Hi, so I bought the Q7 Max recently, and it is my first robot vacuum cleaner. I thought it’s nice to have enough suction power, and actually my classic vacuum cleaner has a hard floor icon for the max level. 

The truth is that our floors are parquet and tiles, and no carpets. I am now thinking that I should have bought the S7 instead, as it may mop better due to 600 g force (the Q7 has 300 g) and mop vibration, and 2500 Pa of suction is just enough.

Have I made a big mistake? How do you compare the S7’s moping performance with your previous robot’s, say S5?"
"Deciding between S8 Pro and S7 MaxV Ultra with a potentially stupid decision maker[If Roborock's site is to be believed, the S8 Ultra will be $1600.](https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-special-offer)

That's above my price bracket, so I think I have to decide between the S7 MaxV (refurb for $1,000) and the S8 Pro (I'm guessing around $1,300).

Outside of the general S7 vs S8 differences, one of the other differences will be with the dock - just emptying the vacuum bag vs dirty water/clean water.

So my stupid question is: **Where does the dirty water come from?**

I currently have a Deebot N8+ and there's no dirty water from it's mop; it just steadily dispenses water, and the water dries off the floor.

Is the dirty water from the Roborock's the water that the dock uses to clean the mopping pad? 

If it's just that, then maybe I can get away with the S8 Pro. If it's more, then maybe I'll go with the S7 MaxV Ultra.

Bonus question: Am I able to just pick up and plop the robot down on another floor and have it clean/mop? I'll likely have the dock set up, and the bot running, on my main floor. But I'd also like to take it upstairs and have it clean carpets + mop up there."
Performance on Wood Floors?Hello! I’m looking to purchase a roborock that will both vacuum and mop. I’m wondering about your experience with the mop feature on wood floors. I’m concerned about it being too wet. Thoughts from those that have used it?
"Comparison - Roborock S8 Pro Ultra vs Roborock S7 MaxV UltraHere is a comparison of the S8 Pro Ultra vs S7 MaxV Ultra

The S8 Pro Ultra has a lot of upgrades from the S7 MaxV.

-The New DuoRoller Riser is a nice addition. Not only can the robot mop only, it can also absorb liquids since there is no roller blocking liquids away! Also, the agitation is better.
-The Dock is definitely more stylish for some. I also appreciate the color choices.
-The suction increase is nice, but probably won’t do much to improve cleaning. The dual brushes should do the trick!
-VibraRise 2.0 is also a nice upgrade. While it doesn’t rise that much (still), the added bar makes for better cleanup.

There are definitely some tiny upgrades, like faster mapping and no go zone suggestions, that may apply to previous models.

Despite these upgrades, there are unfortunately some downgrades.

-Not only did Roborock decide to go down Dreame’s and Ecovacs’ path of an internal water tank, but they also went a step too far by making the mopping plate internal as well! I just don’t understand the logic behind internal components! Why make it internal? At least the water tank is still 200 mL!

-The Reactive 3D is a slight downgrade, even if it performs as well as the S7 MaxV Ultra. The cameras are black and white only, and the lasers and infrared are used to shine the object and recognize it. Theoretically, the obstacle avoidance would be worse, but further testing must be done. But even if it performs just as well, the downside to a black and white camera is that there will not be any video chatting. And it isn’t like there is peace of mind, a camera is still roaming around the house! This is an unfortunate change.

-And then there is the price. At 200 dollars more than the S7 MaxV, this robot may not be worth it.

So which one is right for you?

Get the S7 MaxV if you have pets and your floors are mostly hard wood. The S7 MaxV will do a good enough job at cleaning your hard floors, and you can check up on your pets as well! The S7 MaxV is okay for carpets, but it will have trouble with pet fur. Also get the S7 MaxV Ultra if you value durability over anything.

Get the S8 Pro Ultra if you have pets and/or your floors are mainly carpets or half carpet half hard floors. The S8 Pro Ultra will do a much better job cleaning carpets. Also get the S8 Pro Ultra if you are more concerned with privacy. While there is still a camera, at least it is black and white, so if you are concerned that your robot is taking pictures, rest assure that not all details will be present.

Hope this helps!"
S7 MaxV vs S8 hair on carpet?Has there been any reviews on S7 MaxV vs S8 vacuum performance with pet hair on carpets? I’ve looked and haven’t found any. Maybe it hasn’t made it to enough customers or reviewers yet. I have the S7 MaxV and it is good on smooth surfaces but doesn’t do the best on carpet regardless of the rubber or bristled brush. We have 3 huskies so that is what we are up against.
"Just completed my defection from iRobot with the purchase of an S7+After being over the moon with my S7 MaxV Ultra and its performance, I decided to replace my upstairs Roomba i7+ (which needs a new battery, new wheel cartridges and has been having problems docking since the recent software upgrade) with a refurbished S7+.  Amazon is offering it for $899, then $340 off.  As it was between that and the Q5+, having two of the same robots just made sense, especially as the S7's CFM rating is higher than the Q5.

As my upstairs is mostly carpet, I also picked up the Q5 brush roller as someone mentioned it's compatible with the S7."
"S7+m S7 MaxV+ or one of the S8 models?Hello!

I'm looking at finally getting one robot vacuum cleaner for my apartment. I live in Switzerland, my appartment has 2 bedrooms, 1 living room and 1 dining room/kitchen. It's just me and my gf, no pets, all hardwood floors (but eventually we will have a couple of rugs).

I would be looking at something with a self emptying dock (hence the + model). Moping is cool but I don't mind having to do some work here and there since I don't expect to run it all the time. For that reason I also don't feel like dishing out way more money for the ultra version, considering I've read it will smell bad if I use it less frequently.

I know that the S8 models are being released as we speak and which means that even if I go for an S7 model there might be a price cut. 

I've been looking at The S7+ as it seems to be a good price/performance. I'm also a fan of the bagless design. The roborock website tool suggested the Q7+ for me but I feel like I can justify a price increase for the S7+.

I know that the S7 MaxV has the obstacle avoidance with the cameras, plus some other improvements to the S7+, but how big of an improvement is this, or better how much is this ""needed"". What happens if there are some shoes, socks or cables in the floor when it goes to clean it? Does it just bump into them but still do the job or something worse?

Because if it still does a good job, not having the cameras might actually be a plus for me, just for privacy reasons. Even though I understand that there are already multiple devices ""spying"" on everyone all the time, it never hurts to minimize it when we can.

For reference here are the prices in CHF but it's almost the same as EUR or USD. (new unless mentioned) for the different models. I can also order from amazon Germany for example.

- Q7 Max+ - 476-506 (white/black)
- S7+ - 615-644 (white/black)
- S7 MaxV+ - 755 (650 used)

Or is there a better option for me in the new S8 line? With the discount it might be worth it

Many thanks in advance"
"Rug recommendation for Roborock S7Hey, I have a Roborock S7 and am very happy with its performance, but I also want two get three new rugs for the apartment.

I have found several posts commenting that there robot vacuum did not work with rugs from company x or these are the robot vacuums that work best with rugs, but no posts recommending any rug manufacturer that have a good record with robot vacuums.

Did anyone here have good experience with rugs and a Roborock? If so where did you get the rug or what are the companies to look for?"
New Dryer Module came in!Thanks to u/crafty-train-5641 for the heads up!
"Availability of S7 MaxV Ultra parts & accessories (Belgium/Europe)Hello,

I'm in the market of buying my very first robot vacuum. I'll most likely go straight for the top of the line (either Ecovacs X1 Omni or Roborock S7MVU) but I'm a bit worried about the availability of spare parts and accessoires like dust bags and brushes, especially here in Belgium (practically non-existent) and by further extent Europe.

From my research it seems like the only two major stores to have those are either Amazon or AliExpress. Weirdly enough, I can't find any retailers in Belgium or the Netherlands that carry extra parts, they only sell the complete units. Does Roborock have an official store on AliExpress? I'm that type of person that prefers to buy genuine parts instead of non-original parts.

Additionally, how frequent would one have to replace certain parts? For example the mopping pads, I assume you can also machine wash them from time to time? 

Lastly, yes I know the S8's are on the way, but from what I've read those might retail for even higher prices (cheapest S7MVU I can find right now is around €1230) and compared to the S7 MaxV performance is somewhat similar. Additionally I would try to get the Hot Air Dryer module to make the package complete. Note also that I only have one carpet (at the TV area) and the rest is hardfloor, I also don't have any pets.

Apologies for the rather lengthy post, but I want to clear up those points because spending so much money."

"Thoughts on new S8 vs my S7 max v ultraWell, new models are out, and after some thought it seems like it’s not worth the upgrade for me. Personally, I’m going to go ahead and purchase the auto empty/fill kit for my S7 ultra dock, and mount a small fan hooked up to an Alexa smart plug to handle the drying aspect of the mop and dock. 

Dual brushes are great but I'm not very upset with vacuuming performance at this time. 

Agree or disagree?"
"S7 cleaningI love my Roborock S7. I use it every day for part of my house and once per week I clean the whole house.

Every couple of months or so I clean the S7 thoroughly. Wash the filter or replace. Clean roller, side brush, sensors etc. with soapy water. Then I dry the parts in the oven at 50°C until dry. I think this is necessary to keep the S7 in top performance.

Here you can see some before and after pictures:

"Anyone using aftermarket accessories?Roborock had a $340 off coupon for the roborock s7 maxv ultra so i made the plunge.

"Upgrading from S7 to S7 MaxV Ultra and adding Q5 brush - any mods needed on the brush?The vacuum performance of the S7 was not great, my Roomba j7+ did much better. I'm returning it and the S7 MaxV Ultra delivers today. I bought a Q5 brush to use with it and hope the extra suction is enough to match the j7+. Are there any mods to be made to the brush or is it good to install out of the box? If the S7 MaxV Ultra + Q5 brush are still weak then I'll try the S8 when it comes out in a few weeks."

"S7 MaxV Ultra - short review 3 months after upgrade from S6 MaxVI'd like to post a short review - 3 months after getting S7 MaxV Ultra (with water/dust bin docking station) - maybe it will help someone

I was using S6 MaxV earlier, 100m2/1077sq ft apartment, hardwood/parquet floors + tiles

In general - S7 + Ultra washing station is great. Finally I don't have to remember about washing the mop, refilling the small tank before every session. Docking station holds enough water for moping of over 200m2, mop itself look clean after automatic washing. And mop is always wet when the session starts. All of that is resulting in much cleaner apartment - I can run it more ofthen without any preparations. Cleaning performance looks better than S6 MaxV - especially visible on tiles.

No issues in last 3 months - other than getting stuck once under the radiator.

The biggest downside: process of moving dust from vacuum to the station is loud - like normal vacuum loud. And handles on clean/dirty water buckets are badly placed, and they interfere when opening the buckets.

Conclusion: expensive, but a good product"
"Roborock S7 - Poor Performance/PickupHi,

I recently purchased the new Roborock S7 when it released last week. I just received it a few days ago. 

Since receiving it its run 4 times (3 full cleanings and 1 zone cleanup). My experience has been the following:

After it finished it's first run I wasn't very impressed with the cleaning job. I looked around the house and found several areas that were obviously dirty (looked unvacuumed)

During it's second run I noticed that there were obvious pieces of cat hair (have 2 cats) that it would roll right over and not pick up. It would even cross back over it and still not pick it up. I thought this was odd and figured maybe the dirt bin was full. So I paused it, emptied the bin (it was near full), and then continued the cleaning. I thought that would solve it but it didn't. I watched as it continued to roll right over small pieces of debris without picking it up.

Once it charged back up I emptied the bin and did a zone cleanup in an area where there was some stuff it had failed to pickup (cat hair, tiny scrap of paper, etc). It went over this area several times and still did not pick up. At this point I took out the brush thinking maybe it was tangled or there was some sort of shipping packaging that I missed but there was nothing.

The next day I did another full house cleaning and once again watched as it failed to pick up things. Even cat hair from the first run was still there after this 4th run.


For a bit of background. About 95% of my house is low/medium pile carpet.

I've previously had two other robot vacuums. The S7 for me right now is vacuuming significantly worse than both of these:

1. The original Xiaomi Mi Vacuum
2. Neato Botvac Connect S6

Both of these vacuums did fantastics jobs at cleaning. After they completed a run  the floor was all clean and you could clearly see ""vacuum lines"" on the carpet. The Mi Vacuum would often get the ""Error 10"" but when it ran, it worked well. Since the ""Error 10"" was annoying I decided to get the Neato.

I ""upgraded"" from the Neato to the S7 mainly for 2 reasons: 

1. Neato's navigation is no where near as good as Roborock. The Neato would often get lost or stuck. 

2. I wanted a self empty bin system which the S7 will soon have.



I'm wondering if anyone else has seen issues like I'm describing above? I'm almost thinking the new rubber brush is worse on carpet then the original brush. Or maybe the airflow on the S7 just isn't great?

I'm very much considering returning it. Pretty disappointed with it. Would like to hear other people's experience


EDIT:

 Just an update. After trying it ~7 times I've decided to return my S7. Not cleaning nearly as well as I expected it would."
"Official - New Models From Roborock! S8 Series & Dyad Pro[I put together a quick Youtube video on all the new models from Roborock.](https://youtu.be/UsJoF-ldwhM)

Honestly I think the S8 is a bit of an evolution of the S7 series vs a revolution.  Not a ton of changes, but I am excited for the dual roller brushes and the more powerful vacuum motor.  Also glad object avoidance is now standard on the S8.  I wish they made more changes to the lifting mopping system to allow it to lift higher. 

The S8 Pro is a different model which now includes a lifting roller brush system which is a first in the industry.  I am glad to see it since the roller brush housing plate on the S7 drags the floor when mopping.   The S8 Pro also has an additional vibrating motor to improve performance of the Vibrarise system and you better believe I am going to test that!  

The new ""RockDock"" looks like a slight change from the older Empty Wash Fill Dock, however I do think it looks better and am pleased to see the dryer module is now standard.  I wish they gave a bagless option and a separate detergent tank.  Keep in mind only the S8 Pro is going to work with the Ultra aka RockDock.  The S8 does not have the ability to have the water tank filled or to be able to charge from the Ultra dock which required front charging contacts on the front bumper.

Why does the dock on the S8+ look like the cheaper Q series dock??

The S8 will be available mid April in the US for around $749

No prices or launch dates have been given for the S8 + or the S8 Pro Ultra

I am testing the Dyad Pro now it is a big improvement from the last model.  I think it should be called the Dyad 2 rather than the pro though.  It now stands on its own without a kickstand, includes a separate detergent tank and a heated hot air drying system built into the dock.

The Dyad Pro will go on sale mid January on Amazon for around $449

Here are the official links to the products which should be live at 8:30 EST

"S7 stopped picking up dog hairSwitched from a Roborock S3 to a S7 back in June 2022 when we got our Berner puppy based on reviews about the S7 being great for dog hair.  Floors throughout the house are ceramic tile with only one area rug.  

The S7 worked wonderfully until about four weeks ago, at which time it started gathering the dog hair into little clumps and spitting them out instead of pushing the hair into the dust bin.  The S7 does a good job with any dirt and small debris but is only picking up about half of the hair on the floor now.

I have taken the unit completely apart to see if there were any clogs in the air pathways and found none.  I am open to any ideas on improving the units performance."
"roborock s7 maxv cleaningGood night people.  I have a roborock s7 maxv and I would like to ask a question.  I did a test these days, I just put it to vacuum at turbo power and after finishing, I passed my hand on the floor and noticed that my hand still came out with dust.  Has anyone done this type of test?  The thickest dirt he managed to suck everything up, but the finer particles were still left behind.  In this case, for a more effective cleaning, it is necessary to use the mop to clean it completely.  I thought that due to the power of the robot, it could vacuum everything."
"Cheaper alternative for S7 MaxV Plus without mop?Looking to buy a robot vacuum to use on hard flooring. Main features I care about are good mapping, good performance with pet hair, and preferably an auto-emptying dock (ideally with bag due to allergies). 

The S7 MaxV Plus seems to cover my needs. However as I am not interested in the mopping feature at all, is there a cheaper alternative that still covers my requirements?"
"S7 used to do a great job on edge between tile floor & area rug, but not anymore. Ideas?We have a Roborock S7 that has been a great performer most of the time. We have hard floors throughout the part of our home we use it in, and there's an area rug in the living room. The S7 was doing a wonderful job for quite some time on the border of the area rug and the tile, picking up all the dirt and stuff that sits just adjacent to the rug. Lately it's been missing a bunch of dirt in that area. The side brush and main roller are a few months old, the sensors are cleaned, and I've deleted the map and let it remap the whole area. It's still missing stuff in that area. Any idea what to do next to try to troubleshoot and return it to its previously fantastic performance? Thanks!"
"S7MVU Dryer Module from AliExpress (here in USA) - SUCCESSI just thought I'd report that due to the usual lack of, and/or long wait-time for, availability of Roborock's S7MVU Dryer Module on their website, I purchased and successfully installed their Dryer Module after obtaining one from AliExpress in China.  The unit and app work exactly as they are supposed to on my unit here in the USA.  The main advantages to buying it from AE in China (as opposed to Roborock) are, as far as I can tell:

\- **Availability and Shipping Speed**:  I ordered it on Dec 14, and it arrived today, Dec 27, so 13 days delivery time to my front door here in the SF Bay Area (Roborock doesn't even have it in stock and word is it won't be until sometime between roughly Jan 31 and March 1).

\- **OEM or Knockoff?**:  The box and equipment carried the official Roborock brand markings, except additional verbiage is in Chinese of course; you'll toss everything anyway so ultimately it's a moot point (naturally, Roborock's US version will be in English).

\- **Electrical Hookup/Compatibility**:  As another reviewer on AE's website stated, it comes with an adapter plug for your country, and indeed, included a 3-prong adapter for me here in the U.S.  It works perfectly well without any concerns for 220/110 voltage.  I'm no electrician but perhaps it's like many internationally-adaptive dual-voltage shavers and hair dryers that automatically switch to the correct voltage, working virtually anywhere (Roborock's US version would probably indicate 110V).

\- **App Compatibility?**:  Yes.  The initial invoking and purchase confirmation in the Roborock app are present as expected, and the 2, 3, and 4-hour drying choices are present and changeable.

\- **Price?**  **It cost me exactly and entirely $58.43 USD, shipping included - SWEAR!**  For my City and County (San Leandro, Alameda Co., Calif.), that's a (c'MON 4th grade math...!) 54% of the full price I'd pay on Roborock's website (roughly $109:  @$99 + about $10 tax)!!

\- **Returnable?**  If you've not returned anything to AliExpress before (or haven't done so in a year or something like that), you have 15 days to return it absolutely free -- that includes shipping to China -- for a full refund (I'm not sure if Roborock -- which of course is not Amazon  -- will allow a return unless the product is defective).

\- **Downside?**  Uh, you have that additional China-to-\[your country\] adapter plugged into your wall; but honestly, I can't see mine and who cares anyway?!  ;-)

\- **Summation**:  After I received and installed it (literally two minutes), I performed a zone mop of a few feet (haha), just to monitor it returning to the dock to confirm the dryer mechanism automatically engaged.  It did!  I feel I've made a prescient and exceptional purchase.  Just thought you folks might want to consider this option similarly should you feel this is something you'd like to own.  Either way, enjoy your S7MVU!  :-)

"New Roborock Purchase AdviceSo, I have an S4 and it used to do a good job. It slowly started to degrade in performance, so time for an upgrade. Right now it does not do a good job.

We have a cat, not too big of an house (2 levels), and did not use the S4 mopping (it sucked for the effort). I'd like to upgrade, and use mopping now. Also, never was bothered by emptying the dustbin, so question the value for money of the self emptying docks. It was running daily, and we were emptying the bin once a week or so, and were fine with that.

I see the S7 MaxV now in Amazon at 640$ which looks like a good deal and thinking of pulling the trigger.

1. The AI/Camera/Obstacle Avoidance do not feel to me like worth much, so I was looking for the Pro, yet could not find it in US (I do care about the warranty). Am I missing something?
2. S7 MaxV Ultra has the dock, and probably will hit 1k at some point as it always does. Am I missing anything and it is worth the wait and 400$? How much of effort is the mopping in the MaxV vs the MaxV Ultra?
3. Lastly, S8 is coming in April. With my S4 closing on its last day, am not sure I can wait, but bearing in mind my needs, is it worth the wait?   
I think it mainly is down to the 2 brushes, and improved mopping expected there. Are these not great enough in the S7?  
Also, If I will need to spend double or more for these, not sure it's worth it."
"Q5+ does not empty, poor vacuuming as well. Almost brand new, only 10hrs use, was working fine."
"Can I do a factory reset?“Clean living room, S7 MaxV.”

Is there a way to do a factory reset and let the robot rediscover the house please? Since firmware 02.56.02, it tries to clean through walls, the positioning in the app is way off etc. It performed extremely reliable before that."
"S7 Max V Ultra loud grinding sounds — assistance?We’ve been using our S7 Max V Ultra since it came out (8 months?) and really enjoy it. We try to perform proper maintenance on it, clean it, and have replaced parts as needed since we run it almost every night. 

Just recently it has started making a loud grinding sound and I can’t find the source of it. [My video with audio here](https://youtube.com/shorts/EmaVwjMpANY?feature=share). Do you all have any idea where it could be coming from? I’m fairly handy and I used [this YouTube Roborock disassembly video](https://youtu.be/TKMD-VOvILc) that shows complete disassembly and got it down to 2 minute mark. Below is what I found…

- No substantial debris that could be causing the sound
- All motors checked out and do not make sounds when manually spinning: the motor up top, the side brush motor, each wheel motor, and the underneath brush motor
- I blew out the unit with air and dust did come out but again nothing noticeable
- I removed and cleaned the front 360 wheel

It all reassembled easily and when testing found the same loud grinding was there. Any recommendations on places to look? I’m hesitant to break the robot down any further because I then have to start removing sensors. Thanks!"
"S5 poor side sweeper performance, leaving piles of dog hair everywherePrior to me cleaning my S5, pulling brushes, disassembling and cleaning it the S5 worked very well. After I deep cleaned the device it now leaves piles of dog hair all over, it's as if the side sweeper isn't working. I know I reassembled it correctly so I'm surprised that cleaning it as your supposed to would be the cause. Anyone else find this happening?"
"How much pile height can the S7 MaxV Ultra handle?I currently use the S7 MaxV Ultra on hardwood floors which has been working great. I'm planning to get a rug and I'm trying to figure out how much pile height it can handle. Is 1/3"" too much? 

I already ordered the q5 brush since I heard it's better at cleaning carpets. Since most of my floor is still hardwood/tile, does it make sense to use the q5 brush or will it actually degrade the performance?"
I can recommend to recreate the map of the Roborock if you have trouble with vacuum cleaners ways and cleaning performance.
"I have the Roborock s5 and love the vacuming, but not a fan of the mopping - does the S7 perform better than the s5 for mopping and also any idea when the self empty bin would be available - i'm ready to upgrade but really want a mop that works good AND a self empty bin"
"Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra not properly emptying itselfDear community, I found out two times now, that the robot is not emptying the collected stuff after some vacuum sessions properly even when the action is actually happening.The other day just by chance I wanted to check how the dust bin on the Roborock was (you can check it by just lifting the plastic cover check my first picture). I noticed that the in robot dust bin was full, even after the robot did the ""Emptying dust bin"" routinge at the dock.

I am not sure if this is an issue on my unit only, or if we are supossed to frequently check this to make sure the ""emptying"" action actually occurred properly. Maybe it happened because we had our house especially more dirty because we had several visitors? I will keep a closer eye to it.

I am worried about this because I am sure this would affect the cleaning performance of the robot if its not properly emptying itself when docking, deceiving the purpose of having a self-emptying docking station.

Please kindly share your experiences below. Thanks you! 😉

"Any good 3rd party mopping pads?Hey everyone, thanks in advance for any answers.

I was wondering if there are any 3rd party mopping pads that may work better then the standard Roborock ones on the s7 maxv?

The stock ones do seem fine, but thought their may be others that have maybe thin rubber strips or something through them that may perform even better? Or just in general there may be ones that are better then the Roborock branded. I know with the ecovacs x1 omni, some 3rd party pads absorb the water better, resulting in a better clean"
"S7 and multiple floor navigation without the appI'm trying to research whether the S7 mop-vac will be able to efficiently navigate multiple floor plans without the use of the Roborock app. Ie. by just pressing the buttons on the robot.

I'm thinking of buying S7 for an elderly person who has multiple floors in her house and won't be able to spend time on creating/editing/hacking floor plans, base stations, etc.

I can set the vacuum up, do the initial map creation but I don't know if it would be enough. If for example the robot will be able to figure out, when manually moved between floors, that it needs to use different map, etc.  


EDIT:  
I personally use S7 maxv (plus) in my apartment and it's awesome. From what I understand, S7 should offer similar performance sans the camera system for obstacle avoidance.

"Max V Ultra questionsI recently bought a Q7 and I love it. But I’m seriously thinking of upgrading to a Max V Ultra for the auto mopping and mop washing, as our house is all hard floors and mopping is very manual with the Q7. A few questions.

Is the Max V Ultra totally hands off with the mopping (aside from maintenance)? So the mop module stays on all the time and I can just set it to do a vacuum only run or a mopping run and it all just works? For instance, can I program it to vacuum every day and mop twice a week and it just happens?

Anyone upgraded from a model with the non vibrating mopping to the S7 Max V and can comment on whether the mopping performance is better?

Any other comments or opinions?"
"Is anyone noticing issues with the latest firmware for S7 MaxV Ultra? (02.56.02)Hey all,  


I recently purchased the S7 MaxV Ultra after tons of research and the Black Friday sale that was going on. Everything led me to the S7 MaxV. However, it seems to be getting stuck and sucking up everything that I would expect with all the features it has.  


For example, I do have cats, so yeah, they're like toddlers, and sometimes they leave toys out, so I was curious how it would run with these left out, and the roborock straight clobbers them, and they're fairly larger toys too. I've noticed it sucking up a cord, running over a shoe and getting stuck on it, and even a blanket. I feel like I'm babysitting this instead of letting it perform.   


Am I wrong to assume it shouldn't be doing this? My less expensive shark would avoid these with no problem. I upgraded to the Roborock for the more advanced features, as well as mopping and mop cleaning at the dock.   


After some research online and on this sub, I've noticed a few people in the past have problems after recent firmware. I'm on the current one, or at least it shows that it's up-to-date for me (02.56.02); is anyone else having these problems? I feel like for over $1000 USD, it should at least be avoiding bigger objects like a shoe."
"s7 maxv ultra on carpetThinking about picking up s7 maxv ultra with the black Friday deal but was wondering how the performance Is on low carpet? Our house is one floor, primarily carpet with linoleum in the kitchen,bathrooms and laundry room. Would this vacuum/ mop be worth it over a dedicated vacuum?"
"S7: what's routine maintenance?I've been thrilled with my s7's performance in the (exactly!) one year since we adopted her. That's despite hardly doing any routine maintenance along the way, thus the big nasty ball of wife & dog hair wrapped around the main brush axle. 

I do empty the dust bin and wash the mop head but is that enough??? Noooooo..."
"MaxV Plus under EktorpJust bought an S7 MaxV Plus as my first robot vacuum and I am astonished at its performance. 

The only thing I am not able to make him understand is that he can go under the sofa (IKEA’s ektorp). He sees a wall because the sofa’s cover goes down almost to the pavement. Is there a way to tell him to have faith and just go under without having to lift the sofa’s cover?"
"Questions Before Buying an S7 MaxV Ultra - Please Help Me Out!Quite a lot of questions, but hopefully a few people can take a few minutes to give me a hand, I would really appreciate it!

This will be my first venture into robot vacuums, having a tough time deciding between this and the Ecovacs Omni (mainly because of the heated dry on the Omni and cleaner dock), but think I'm going with the RR S7 due to performance and removable water tank on the vacuum.

This is a money is no object purchase for us, so I'm just trying to get the best. 

We have a 2 story house, bottom floor is where this will be docked. Kitchen/dining is all tile, living room is wood floor and family room is all carpet. 2nd floor is all carpet, but for the restrooms being tile. 

My questions, please help me out: 

1. How does mopping work, do I just leave the pad on all the time? One of the ""cons"" of the Omni is that you have to flip it over and take the pads on and off, how is this not the case with the RR? 
2. If you're vacuuming and mopping at the same time, even if the vacuum is at the front, wouldn't some moisture get into the dust bin the vacuum uses and get super gross? 
3. Over time, does the vacuum roller get gross from the moisture from mopping? Obviously, maintenance, but just wondering if you vacuum and mop daily, does this become more of a problem?
4. I watched a video where this thing is super loud when going over grout lines on tile due to the hard plastic wheels, is this always the case? We have two little ones and were hoping to run it at night since the normal operating noise isn't too much louder than a dishwasher, but if its going to sound like something fell every 3 seconds, that's just insane (does the Omni have rubber wheels to not have this problem?)!
5. Living room with wood floor has one of those kids rubber play mats, about the size of a normal area rug. It has lowered edges so I would assume the vacuum can get on it. Can I have the RR S7 mop it or will it just think its a carpet and only vacuum? 
6. Using it upstairs with no dock - Vacuuming seems easy, just put it up there, let it orient itself and boom. But how would I prep it to allow it to mop the 2 bathrooms? Is there a way to force it to fill itself with the clean water and then tell me to take it upstairs and then also let me know when I need to take it back to the dock to empty the dirty water? Or do I really have to take the entire dock upstairs? 
7. Lastly, I saw mention that some people recommend replacing the vacuum brush roller with an older model one because the plastic brush roller sucks, but in reviews, the plastic performed better than the hybrids of the Omni, etc. Thoughts if this is necessary? 

Thank you all for your help, hoping to pull the trigger on the purchase today so I can get it this week!"
My Roborock get stuck or skids when moping?? But what it’s vacuuming without the water tank it performs perfectly fine. Please advise.
"Tips for operating my new Roborock S7 on multiple levels with spoty wifi/Internet accessI'm waiting for my new S7 to arrive and I've been researching and I'm curious how it'll work within my home.

The house is over 3 levels. Almost all tiled except for a couple of small carpets in the centre of some rooms. And there only adults, no kids or pets so I'm confident the cleaning performance won't be an issue.

My concern is that not the whole house is typically covered by a strong wifi signal. And even then because of the remote location internet is slow when it does work and often just stops for hours or days at a time.

I'd love for someone to give me some tips on operating the unit under these conditions. I also have specific questions:

1. What features will be available/not available if I lose Internet access.

2. Is it an issue if I start the vacuum in an area where it has wifi but it goes into areas where there is no WiFi coverage as it cleans.

3. When moving it from floor to floor should I move the home unit with it or just take the unit its self and then return it to base my self.

4.What features will be available/not available if I lose WiFi. Can I just take it to a floor and tell it to clean? What mode does it clean in when doing this (Vacuum and mop strength)?

Thanks in advance. I can't wait to do less housework."
"S7 performs less than S5?It could be me, but I owned an S5 that cleaned my livingroom fine.  
I recently upgraded to S7, and it seems that it is much less efficient in terms of intelligent routes: The S7 seems to go kind of randomly through the room, whereas the S5 was very precise. 

I also noticed that it seems to miss spots, and it takes longer to clean the enitre room vs the S5...   
Cleaning results are pretty much equal so far, except for the mised spots obviously...

Anyone else having the same experience?"
"Best choice for just carpet and object detectionAny one have a recommendation on just a robot without the mopping function and has object detection?  I love my S7MaxV but my downstairs is all hardwood and upstairs is all carpet.  I don't want to carry the guy up here.  I currently use a Neato D7 upstairs but I hate it doesn't have object detection, so I have to make sure everything is up and moved out of its way.  I have an S7, that I replaced with the S7 MaxV but as with the Neato, no object detection and the Neato did a better job than the S7 when I tried them both, so I kept it up here."
Finally they added map backup&restore for S7! Also Quick Mapping looks promising
"How do Roborocks perform in small bathrooms?I have a couple of smaller size bathrooms with hard floors and bath mats. I'm wondering how well the roborock models will navigate such a small space - will the bath mats get bunched up? Will it go navigate effectively around the toilet, trash can, toilet brush holder on the floor, etc.? I know it will miss some corners and tight spots like behind the toilet, but I'm wondering how well it works in bathrooms overall. I'm also curious if I run it in the bathrooms on a regular basis, even if it misses some spots, if that will help prevent dust/hair buildup behind the toilet so I have to clean less often. I don't yet have a robot vacuum and getting one to clean the bathroom floors is one of my hopes! I'm looking at the S7 so I'm also interested in having it mop the bathroom floors, but I know not a lot of people have the S7 yet so I'd like to hear about your experiences with other models. Thanks!"
"S5 Max Mop Attachment Ruins PerformanceI just got my S5 Max and I've been having some strange issues that seem to happen when the mop is attached. I let the robot go through the entire house without the mop attached as I have both hard floors and carpet, and that works great. However, when I attach the mop to it to have it go through an area like the kitchen, here is what happens:

1.) Robot cannot leave the charging dock on its own. It will sit there with the fan going and shift left and right slightly until I physically move it backwards.

2.) It will go through the zone in a very sporadic manner, acting like there are objects to avoid when there is no obstruction several feet from it in all directions

3.) It will occasionally pause for 5 seconds at a time or start spinning in a circle.

4.) When it either finishes finally, or if I manually tell it to dock, it cannot dock on its own. It will go upto the dock and get right to the edge of the dock but then back off and act like it has to realign. I presume it's because it's not able to make it far enough forward for it to make contact with the dock charging contacts.

I've updated to the latest firmware, rebooted the robot several times, and even had it create a new map from scratch (which worked perfectly since again I didn't have the mop attached). The dock is on hard floor with 2+ feet of clearance in all directions as well. I also can have the mop removed and select one of the zones I've created and it will leave the dock, clean the zone efficiently, and then get back to the dock and charge all on its own. Is there something I'm missing as a new Roborock owner or could there be something wrong with it?"
"s4 carpet performance ""degrading"" over time?I have read all the poor reviews of the S4 with ""standard carpet"" and have to say my experience somewhat mirrors that but with one caveat

When I first got my s4 it worked wonderfully on my ""low-med standard carpet"" ... it wouldnt have any issues at all.

then every now and then it would throw an error...maybe 10% of hte time....then 20%....now if it touches the carpet it basically has no idea what to do

could this be due to anything else? What am I missing? firmware? sensors?"
Are these scratches worrisome ? Will they affect performances
"Big difference between S7+ and S7Max Ultra?Hey everyone, debating about pulling the trigger on the S7Max and returning the S7+ I purchased. Is there a big difference in terms of performance?

An online article I read said there really wasn’t, but curious what the consensus is on this sub. 

For reference, I can purchase the S7+ for $850 Canadian and the Ultra for $1500 Canadian."
"Dyad recommendable? (long term experiences?)Hi i found a deal for $230 so i checked a couple of reviews which were prtty positive about the performance of the Dyad.

However if you check some user reviews (amazon et al) a lot of people seem to be having problems with the Dyad dying on them after a couple of days/weeks/months (e5 error and similar).

so i was wondering if you guys could give me a heads up on the reliability of the Dyad.

thanks"
"S5 wont start cleaning manually or via appHi,

My Roborock S5 recently stopped working. The light surrounding the power light is not illuminated. I cannot start a cleanup via manually pressing the power button or remotely via the phone app.  It plays the startup music and then says ""charging"". I have tried resetting the wifi and have performed a factory reset and then updated to the latest firmware etc but still have the same issue. Any ideas?

Thanks."
"UK or Ali Express users - which dust bags are you guys buying for the plus dock?Hi All

I ideally wanted to use only the genuine Roborock bags for my S7 MaxV plus however all I can find are 3rd party compatible ones with mixed reviews on performance, can users share links or brand names of which ones they've had luck with and i'll try and buy the same?

Alternatively if you find some genuine ones  for sale which I can get shipped to UK that would be the best, i've had a look everywhere and dont think this is a option ..

Advice appreciated! :)"
Dragging sound caused by silicone sealer
"App Map Surface QuestionGot my S7 MaxV plus yesterday and it mapped everything and is performing well. 

My question is about in the app specifically. in my floor map I manually inserted carpet over all the carpeted areas, and changed the surface of the kitchen to wood and bathroom to tile. 

Is that really necessary? I've got patchwork of carpet call outs and it looks messy on the map. I was playing around and saw the default selection for room floor surface. 

I know the bot is smart enough to know hard floor vs carpet, so can I just reset all the rooms to default in the app map (carpet in main areas, and laminate in bathroom+kitchen) and get appropriate performance?"
"Self empty dock contains too much voltage for an apartment outlet?I recently received the self empty dock for the s7. I had finished unpacking and assembling the self empty dock. I performed a quick clean around the apartment and it returned to the docking station. As I pushed the self empty button on the app I heard the vacuum engage and instantly all the lights in my apartment went out along with the tv. 

After the outage, the only things that remained on were the dryer that was going, some of the clock lights on the microwave and stove and some plug in appliances in the kitchen. 

There still seems to be no power coming from 3 outlets in the apartment. I will have to call maintenance in order to resolve this issue further. I’m not sure if the outlet does not possess the voltage required to operate the self empty dock or that maybe i had multiple big appliances running in a close proximity? I am not entirely sure, just looking for some helpful advice from the community."
"Slightly Disappointed in Roborock S7 MaxV - A ReviewAfter watching multiple reviews, doing some research and posts, I decided to purchase a MaxV the other day off Amazon with the $90 off coupon. I eventually want to get the Ultra Dock, which I'm hoping alleviates some of my issues, but in the meantime I'm running the MaxV by itself in my relatively small house that mostly consists of hardware floors, and single large area rug. Over the past few days of ownership though I've been pretty disappointed with it's performance and now realize that my use case was not covered by most of the reviews/tests I've seen of the robot in various youtube videos, etc. I wanted to share my experiences here for anyone that's on the fence and might face a similar situation.

First some of the good things: One of the reasons why I wanted the roborock was for the AI features. I have a dog, a long haired german shepherd (named reggie) that loves to play with his toys but rarely (never) puts them away. My current Neato D5 often gets stuck on said toys, so I'm required to pick up and put away everything before I run it.. which makes it hard to schedule and leads me to running it less often than i'd like. The Roborock's AI features accel here. I can schedule it to run at a set time or multiple times and regardless to what's on the ground it does an excellent job of avoiding all the toys/cables/etc that my previous Neato would get stuck on or require no-go zones to avoid running into.

The other thing I love is the mopping. I live in a very wooded area and being that we are in April (lots of rain) Reggie often brings some mud in on his paws and onto the floor. The Max V's mopping quickly removes theses and keeps my wood floors very clean compared to how they were previously. I really love this feature.

The negatives. I want to preface this by repeating that a lot of these issues are going to be specific to my house and I realize I'm probably in the minority but i also think that these issues can be remedied by different design choices or options..  I'll explain as I go on.

Bin Size. I came from a Neato D5 which has a 750ML bin. I would run the Neato every 2 days or so which would often result in the bin being completely full. I figured with the Max V and it's AI abilities, I would be able to run it more frequently as it would ignore the toys and each day I would just clean the bin out daily and it would be enough. I was wrong. The bin often fills 3/4's of a way through a cleaning cycle. The robot continues cleaning (it has no full bin sensor) and essentially a bunch of dog hair (again long haired shepherd has a ton of hair) gets jammed up in the roller/bin ""chute"". Unless I'm there to stop and clean it, it basically just doesn't clean 3/4's of the house. I was hoping that if it had a ""bin full"" sensor that when I got the ultradock it could return, empty it's bin then continue.. but no sensor. I've been told by other reddit users that a workaround is to divide the house up into multiple runs so it empties between each run. I'm going to try this when I eventually get the ultra dock but until then it's kind of a bummer. I'd prefer if it knew the bin was full and stopped/could return to empty when you do have a dock.. or it just had a larger bin to begin with. I have one dog, my fiance and me.. when we have kids, or if I decide to get another dog this thing is going to be overloaded before my house is even half clean.

Climbing Ability. I have what I'd consider a small threshold between my livingroom and kitchen. My Neato had no problem climbing over said transition but the Max V can't clear it. On top of that I also have a C desk that sits next to my couch and blocks a small corner area behind it. The part that sits on the ground of the desk is not very high.. maybe slightly more than 3/8"" inch? The Neato was able to go over this and clean the back corner of the room.. the Max V gets stuck on it. I had to zone the area off and I've just been manually cleaning it now.  I'm going to try changing the kitchen/living room transition for one with less height and hoping that fixes the issue.. the C table is whatever, I personally didn't expect the Neato to climb it when I first set it up but I guess the fact that it does and the Max V can't is a little disappointing, the kitchen threshold is just mind boggling to me though.

Carpet Cleaning. The area rug I have doesn't have particularly high pile - 1/4"". I notice a lot when I'm working out/doing yoga or whatever (laying on the floor) that Reggie's hairs' seem to get embedded into it a bit. The Neato's bristle brush seems to be able to yank these hairs out for the most part but to get them all out I need to pull out my Dyson and actually manually vacuum. The Max V's rubberbrush is horrible at removing these hairs. Even at max suction it leaves the rug covered in hair. Running my Neato after the Max V results in the Neato pulling not only a lot of hair but sandy/grit/dirt out of the rug that the Max V just didn't get for whatever reason. I would really like to see a bristle brush option for the Max V. I think it would resolve the hair issue.

Mopping. But wait I thought you said it's great? It is, but the one thing I don't like it has having to prewet the mop before I use it. I wanted to run the mop when I'm not home and Reggie is upstairs sleeping, which is usually about an hour or so after I leave the house but since I have to prewet the mop it's impossible. The Ultradock obviously fixes this (as far as a I know it prewets the mop) but I feel like having more areas on the robot itself that releases water would also fix this without the need of the expensive dock.

\_

In the end I'm probably going to keep it until I get the dock. If the dock doesn't fix the few issues it can, I'll probably sell it to my Mom who has been looking to buy one anyway and doesn't have the dog/threshold/climbing issues.

Again I just wanted to share my impressions of the device, it's shortcomings for my usecase and where I think they could improve in the future."
"Roborock G10s Import to UK QuestionsI can possibly buy Roborock G10s Plus directly from China and get it delivered to be used in UK, but I was told this machine will not be able to connect to the smart home app. I had similar experience with smart home before where this is only a matter of connecting to China Server / European servers, and I am wondering what kinds of blocks they actually implemented and will that be a workaround. Honestly, I don't care if this can be connected to the smart home app if the machine can perform the functions if I can avoid the 80%+ mark up for a international model.

Any thought or experience?"
"Roborock ""Vac & Mop"" vs Vacuum and then MoppingI recently bought the Roborock S7 Max V during the 8 year anniversary sale. I had a quick question. Is there a difference in performance between the ""Wash & Vac"" setting compared to having a routine where it vacuums and then mops? Also, for the ""Wash & Vac"" setting, does it vacuum and mop in the same pass or does it do two passes (one for vacuuming and then another for mopping)?"
"EXTREMELY Disappointed in S7 MaxV Ultra**UPDATE:**

After a few days of futzing with it, I have everything working *MOSTLY* well.  It still gets stuck in some very bizarre places on occasion, but far, FAR less then it did initially...  When it's stuck the behavior is a bit odd.. see video below of it under a bed... it'll be ""stuck"" like that for about 15 minutes and then error our that it needs to be moved.  It sorta tries to move forward, backward, and turn left right but doesn't.

I've reached out to support and hopefully we can get it up to 100%.

&#x200B;

I've had a S5Max since it was released.  That thing was amazing and really turned me into a Roborock recommender.  It ran daily (5 days a week) flawlessly for years without \*ever\* getting stuck, etc.  It ran so well and effortlessly I would often forget to change the dustbin.

I was super excited to get the new Ultra.  It arrived, I set it up, did a quick map and a first cleaning run.

So far, it's been stuck TWENTY SEVEN TIMES on a single run that its predecessor had zero issues with.  It gets stuck in places it should NOT get stuck... against walls, in a regular 90 degree corner, etc.

It seems to have less torque in the wheel motors which prevent it for spinning on regular carpet.  I'm presuming the mop cloth just provides too much friction for the wheels to overcome and and it cannot spin when in a corner or backup at all...

Anyway... Im very close to returning this thing... if it cant carry the mop and vacuum, the entire point of all-in-one unit is lost.  For $1500 I expected significantly better performance.

Heres an example of the kinds of places its getting stuck...

"I live in Canada and would like to get a RoborockHey there,
I am very new to this robot vacuum world and after many MANY long hours I've decided to go for Roborock and particulary for that S5Max which could give a good price/performance without breaking the bank.

I have few questions before jumping guns. Since I live in Canada, we don't have many options for Roborock and the S5Max on Amazon is around 550$+ tax around 600$

My question, should I go for that Roborock S5Max? Would it fit the bill for a large apartment as it's pretty much covered all with hardwood (with 2 kids). The mop feature - for me wife - would be a bonus feature but she is really interested in having some good performance out of this unit

and second question, I have seen a S4Max (without mop feature) go about 350$ CAD tax in. I'm debating what justify the 200$ price difference with the S4Max and the S5Max beside the mopping feature?

And lastly, any tips on WHEN to get any of Roborock unit. I'm thinking of waiting for the Black Friday but I don't want to wait and dissapoint myself with minimal price cut if not, none?

Any tips to guide me through this would be greatly appreciated or any other brand or model you'd suggest me go otherwise . Thank you!!"
"Solution for S7 MaxV Ultra - Poor pickup of Dog hair on Medium Pile Carpet (and review)I was new to the robot vacuum world a couple of weeks back. I have been using my handheld Dyson Vaccum and a Bissel handheld power mop and have had no complaints with them for the last 5 years (and still don't have any). However, I realized I have been wasting 30 minutes or more, vacuuming and mopping every day.

So, I didn't review or look much and just ordered the highest-end Roomba (s9+) and Brava (M6). Boy, I was disappointed. The navigation and mapping were so frustrating to watch and it took hours to do any cleaning and always got stuck and couldn't go back to the dock on its own. However, the cleaning, when it was able to do, was sooo good. With its double roller, I could see the nice clean freshly cleaned carpet marks. However, since I had to always help it go back to the dock or help it get unstuck, it was pointless for my use case. I was able to return it.

So, impressed with the cleaning performance, I was motivated to look more into other vacuums and mops and do a little bit of more research before purchasing a new one. In the end, I ended up buying the S7 MaxV. (I will be getting the dock later in June 2022).

Boy, I was surprised at how efficient the Roborock was at navigating/mapping and avoiding obstacles. It finished the mapping of my house in minutes and not hours like the Roomba. After having used it daily for the last 2 weeks, these are my pros and cons:

**Pros:**

1. excellent navigation
2. above average/almost perfect obstacle avoidance
3. excellent hardwood floor cleaning
4. excellent mapping
5. almost excellent mopping
6. much quieter than Roomba (still pretty loud)

**Cons:**

1. pet hair pickup on medium pile carpet is almost non-existent. (almost deal-breaker)
2. For the first few days, you might have to tweak the map a little bit. (this is expected, as you will be setting up no-mop/no-go zones)
3. Ineffective cleaning around transition zones (more on that below)

&#x200B;

So, if you have a lot of surface transitions, there are three issues:

1. if you go from hardwood floor to carpet, it does increase the suction power, however, it lags a bit, so the suction power is reduced towards the edges. Maybe a firmware update will fix this?
2. Even though it lifts the mop when it detects carpet, it is not high enough, especially in transition zones where the robot is at a tilted angle. So be prepared to have slightly moist carpet edges.
3. when it transitions from carpet to hardwood floor, it lags a little bit to lower the mop, so the mop is not effective at carpet edges. Maybe a firmware update will fix this?

&#x200B;

So the above issue was not a deal-breaker for me, however, the pet hair pickup on the carpet is a joke (The Roomba performance was as good as my handheld dyson for this). The reason is the **all-rubber brush**. Older-gen Roborocks used a hybrid brush that had rubber and bristles and were very effective at carpet cleaning. However, with the S7 series, they have introduced the all rubber brush because it does a good job of not having hair tangle on it. But this has severely limited the pet hair pickup on the carpet.

**Solution?**

1. the new Q5+ has a hybrid brush with bristles and it is compatible with the S7 series Roborocks! So once they are available to order individually, I am sure to order them to try. I called Roborock customer support, they don't know the release dates for Q5+ spare parts yet. (Hopefully soon). performs. **\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***  It looks like Roborock has added the Q5 main brush for sale: https://us.roborock.com/products/main-brush-for-q5 However, from the image, it doesn't look like a Q5 brush. I am tempted to order but will wait for some reviews.
2. In the meantime, I found an alternative: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097DK5KQV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097DK5KQV). I have ordered it and it is arriving today. I will update here on how it performs. **\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*** So this brush is no good, the bristles are too soft and I did not see any improvement in carpet cleanup. So, I guess we will have to wait till they launch Q5+ brush as a separate accessory."
"Does the S7 MaxV Ultra station cleans the mop frequently during the mopping?Just as the title, I'm not sure if the mop cleaning is performed multiple times or just when the robots finished the plan.
Thanks for the answer."
"S7 MaxV Ultra Cleaning Solution *Serious Answers Only Please*I know roborock sells a cleaning solution, but can someone please tell me why I am required to use theirs? It is a cleaning solution that sits in a revivor. I cant imagine in a million years that simple green solution inside my mop or empty wash fill dock will damage it, so I am thinking about using a simple green solution instead. Im not being difficult here, I want a genuine answer so I dont ruin my Empty Wash Fill dock. Is it a matter of performance or a matter of preserving my hardware from damage?"
"Love the S7 Max BUT it's leaving streaks on my tiled flooring during mopping functions.Hi Guys,

I am aware of existing threads, reporting the same issues here, but would just like to revive the discussion a little bit to see if there are any other solutions which you all are adopting and works.

Thank you."
Roborock S7 brush alternativesHello!  Has anyone found an alternative brushroll for the S7?  I assume the Q5 brush would work once it's available to purchase as an accessory but I have had issues with performance on carpet with the new brush in comparison to the S5 max brush.  Thank you!
"S7 maxv ultra always gets stuck on the exact same cat toyIt would be great if roborock would allow you to program the distance it uses to avoid certain obstacles. It already takes images of certain obstacles, so I would like it to save every image of each obstical from its last cleaning session and then allow me to raise or lower the avoidance distance for each obstical.

It has the images to compare against so it should be able to know when it reaches a specific obstical. I would like to set the avoidance distance to at least an entire foot on each side for this 1 individual toy.

I work in software so I understand that this could definitely be wishy washy with performance. Until it take images of the exact toy form multiple angles it won't have a good AI train on it, but it's definitely possible."
"S5 Max error 5 after main brush replacementI recently purchased a used S5 max with ~300 hours (13k m^2) on it. It performs well and I’m very happy with it. 

I ran it for about 2 weeks on the old brush, with no issues. I recently did a full service (filters, brushes, proper clean etc) and ever since then I am getting repeated error 5. Error 5 indicates main brush tangled or obstructed, however when I go to the vacuum there is no apparent obstruction or blockage. Resuming the clean allows it to continue just fine. 

It seems odd that this would occur after I have replaced the brush, however maybe the motor is wearing out and the increased brush resistance is throwing the error? 

I believe the carpet setting overrides the suction level selected (and the error), so this isn’t really a suitable solution as 90+% of my place is carpet and I don’t want max suction all the time. 
Any thoughts or ideas is appreciated"
"Q7 Max vs S5 Max?Hi, so i'm looking to buy a robot vacuum with mop function and i've been scouring the internet to find that most people recommend S5 Max for a budget robot vacuum. So i was going to buy the S5 Max but i couldn't find the model from the Roborock official store in my country, instead the official store recommend me to buy a newer model that is the Q7 Max.

I can just buy the S5 Max from a reseller but i'm thinking whether i should just get the Q7 Max if it performs better than the S5 Max. I couldn't find the comparison between the two of them so maybe anyone can help me with this?

I'm aware that if i'm looking to purchase a robot vacuum with mopping function, the S7 would be ideal, but i cannot really splash out the extra money to get the S7 as this is my second robot vacuum purchase (i bought eufy g10 hybrid before but i'm very much disappointed with the product)

"Best Robo vacuum for low pile carpet?Hello! We live in a 2 story house with the lower floor with hardwood and upper floor with a low pile carpet. We have a S6 MaxV that we regularly use in the lower hardwood floor. However, it does a OK job on carpets. Additionally, we have to take it up and down every time we clean. I am looking for the community's suggestion for a robo vacuum that is good with low pile carpet. 

Requirements

* Brand not important (I really prefer Roborock since I have it and really satisfied with their performance but if there are better ones with other brands I am fine with it)
* Mapping is really important as we some times clean only certain rooms. 
* Works well in low pile carpet. 
* Our typical usage - scheduled cleaning every night / certain time in the ady

Any suggestions from the community would be really welcome. Thank you!"

"Is the S7 still worth buying over S7 MaxV ?The auto emptying thing isn't important for me, and I can set a red zone for the cables at the thouse.

The S7 MaxV isn't getting sold here right now but when it does it will be priced more than 2x of the S7. I want to get it for my mom this week for the mother's day but i'm not sure if I should wait or not.



Is S7 still a good choice ?"
"Black carpet - Cliff sensor issue [possible solution]Hello, I just got my Roborock S7 and I immediately got very disappointed, as several other users. That because it cannot vacuum black carpet. It gives error 4 (clean cliff sensors) in all the tries. Well, for the rest, it’s has an impressive performance.
So, going to point of this post:
- It could be embedded on the app a message pop up notification whenever the robot detects a carpet. In this message, the user has the option to select the colors of the carpet and if there are dangerous situations for the robot close by. Based on the results, the robot may disable the cliff sensors momentarily.
- Or just add to the app, an option for the user to disable the cliff sensors for carpets surfaces whenever it is detected.

I’m really in hope that the company takes this situation more seriously and fix the problems. Does not need to be the proposed solutions in here but PLEASE fix it! 

Thanks"
"Comparing my roomba i7+ to my S4 MAX.When comparing my i7+ and my s4 max, I find the i7 just constantly slams into shit full speed. The s4 isn’t great in that regard, but it at least slows down before it hits something. I just sat and watched my i7 plow full speed into the same couch leg 4 times in a row. 

Also, the mapping doesn’t seem particularly great? The i7 has somehow missed my ENTIRE FUCKING KITCHEN. After multiple mapping runs. 

What the fuck. 

I expected the i7 to be an upgrade but so far it’s actually been performing worse than my s4. It loves to just aimlessly spin, takes 2x as often to complete a run, and has already accumulated a ton of scratches from hitting stuff.

The cleaning base has been absolutely amazing so far though. 

The app is so-so. It doesn’t seem to have the stupid limitations on number of no-go zones and stuff that Roborock has, but it also doesn’t give you any of the customization that the Roborock gives you. Your only option seems to be whether you want 1 pass or 2 passes - can’t choose power level or anything like that. 

Honestly if I had paid full price for it I’d be returning it. It sure as fuck isn’t worth the $700+ it’s listed for from my current experience with it."
"New to Roborock! The Q5 is better than the S5 Max if I don't mop. Is my logical sound? (See post.)Here is my reasoning: The only reason to pick the S5 Max at this price is if you do mopping. The S5 Max was an extraordinary piece of engineering for its time, but that time has now passed with the release of Roborock's brand new Q series. The S5 Max performs a tad worse in deep cleaning than the new Q5, which is currently on sale for $329 for a limited time on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N3JKFFY). According to Vacuum Wars which I consider the ultimate reviewer of robot vacuums, the S5 Max gets a 78 (https://youtu.be/VSkw5FFur7Y?t=155) in their deep cleaning test while the new Q5 gets an 84 (https://youtu.be/GiobHi7E3co?t=92), the highest of ANY Roborock to date! The only reason to pass on the Q5 is if you do mopping, which the S5 Max had dominated in as a robot mop combo (https://youtu.be/VSkw5FFur7Y?t=362). But if mopping is not a requirement, the Q5 is the superior offering at a lower price than the S5 Max here. If you see the S5 Max drop below $300 though, it may be worth the consideration.

Does this make sense? Thank you for letting me join your subreddit community!"
"S4 Max vs. S7 Vacuuming ComparisonHi all,

I currently have a S4 Max, which does a fairly phenomenal job vacuuming my hardwood floors and low-pile carpets. However, I see the s7 is now on sale, and I'm considering purchasing one to replace the s4. I know the s7 has the mopping feature, which will be nice, but how does it's vacuuming performance stack up against to the s4 Max? Some reviews indicate that the s4 might actually be better.

The only reason I would make the upgrade is to get the added mopping feature and the docking station, but I don't want to lose any vacuuming/suction power in the process. Thanks in advance."
"Auto-Empty Not Working, Cleared Dock & Replaced FiltersHoping someone can shine some light on this so I don't have to try and deal with Roborock's customer service.  


I have an S7 with auto-empty dock (NA Bagged version) and it has been working flawlessly for the last 4-5 months spare the occasional dock jam. However, the dock is barely working anymore when it attempts to empty out the items in the dustbin.

  
I have:  
* Emptied out the dustbin so it's only a few crumbs and dust bunnies  
* Removed the bottom of the auto-empty dock to see if there were any debris  
* Removed debris from the dock's channels using a bendable wire   
* Replaced HEPA filter in the dustbin and auto-empty dock  
* Replaced the bag inside of the dock itself  
* Tested with no bag to see how much it was getting   
* Ensured the airflow door on the container opens  
* Replaced the main brush roller on the robot and reseated the bottom plate  
* Slightly moved the robot back/forward and side/side while emptying to try and get a better seal  


It will definitely suck up some crumbs and other smaller debris, but anything with any weight is barely even moved to the front of the dustbin.   


Does anyone have any suggestions on what they've done to restore the performance of their auto-empty dock? Roborock suggests clearing the ""Dust Inlet"" without much describing what or where that is. There's about a thousand holes on this device where dust/debris pass thru."
"Cleaning brush with dish soap, made it less effective ?After having my S4 Max for about a year, I finally decided to try out scheduled cleanings. All was great until one Saturday morning I discovered it had engulfed a sizeable volume of cat vomit whilst I was sleeping in.

I cleaned the whole unit with a damp cloth and some elbow grease but for the brush used a few drops of Dawn dish soap.

Ever since I had cleaned the brush with soap, the vacuum seems to be lacking in it's performance e.g. leaving behind some fur on the carpet and less thorough cleaning around the house in general. I'm convinced I may have altered the brush's performance with the soap cleaning. Perhaps it could have made the bristles less stiff and therefore less able to 'dig' for dust/dirt particles in the carpet pile?

I'm considering buying a replacement to confirm, but am weary as I've heard they don't work quite as well as the one that comes with the vacuum. I've stayed on top of preventative maintenance tasks so can't figure any other causes. Has anyone had a similar experience to this?"
"Changed from Ecovacs OZMO 950 to Roborock S5Max. What I wish I knew review.Hi,

TLDR: I had an Ecovacs Ozmo 950, worked great for 2 months then had constant anti drop sensor errors. Had service, was worse when it got back. Returned it, bought a Roborock S5 Max a few months later. It has it's flaws, mostly with the app. I would have been happy with either, RR just need to fix the sequencing.

There are things I wish I had known before buying the Roborock (RR). I looked at plenty of reviews and many people saying that they bought an S7 but wish they had stayed with their S5 Max. I was also looking at an Ecovacs T8 AIVI, but the problems with my first Ecovacs (EV) made me want to change, especially after a service that seemingly did nothing.

**Vacuum Performance**: *Winner Ecovacs*. I don't know if it because of the two side brushes vs one on the RR, but in my situation the Ecovacs did better for cleaning my low pile carpet. I have been getting a lot of main brush errors on the RR but it does seem it was because I didn't have carpet boost on. Regardless, I didn't have it on with the EV and it still cleaned better.

**Mopping Performance**: *Winner Ecovacs*. You can't beat a steam mop, the EV left a wet line behind it but it didn't actually clean any marks. Same with RR. I have to give this to the EV because it detects carpet and doesn't go over it, only around it. With the RR I have had to set No Mop Zones all over the map. The RR is much easier to detach the mopping pad.

**App Mapping**: *Winner Roborock*. I have many low windows and have the same problem that it sees out the windows and gives an off looking map. RR didn't split the rooms well (most of the house was one colour), the EV app did that perfectly, but the accuracy was better with the RR. Roborock wins because I mapped once and it was perfect. I needed 6 attempts to get a good one with EV and then if I had to manually move it to clean, it would reset, occasionally the map would turn and it would lose the dock. The RR got lost last night and lost the dock on the map. I put it back on the dock and it retained and returned the original map and knew where it was. I had a corruption in the RR map, I restored it in the map and it was back to normal, no remapping required. RR wins this easily.

**App Splitting and Merging**: *Winner Roborock* (and it isn't even close). I tried splitting and merging with the EV app and it is so bad, so unsuccessful, it should never have been released. Thankfully I could undo before messing up my map again. Depending on your room (like if there are two entrances) you need some different thinking to split rooms with the RR app, but it works perfectly. So easy to do.

**App Scheduling / Sequencing**: *Winner Ecovacs*. The EV was easier to create custom schedules and select the room sequence. It was ordered in the order I pressed on the room. RR requires you to edit the map and select the sequencing, but this is for the whole map. If I want to schedule to do just three rooms, you have to use the overall sequence for that. If i have seven rooms but don't sequence the last 4, it just does them after. RR need to fix this so that when I select rooms in my schedule, it is done in the order of selection. An overall sequence only makes sense if always doing a full clean, which is likely only when mapping initially.

**Navigation**: *Winner Roborock*. I would constantly see the EV bumping into straight walls. It would go along a bit turn in, bump reverse, go ahead more, turn in bump etc, all the way along. The RR hugs the skirting board with rarely a bump against the wall. The EV also gets hung up badly trying to do around chair and bed legs and wastes a lot of time. I saw my EV once spend 40 minutes navigating around a mat when mopping. It detects and won't mop over it, but it won't do straight lines around it either.

**Overall**: So, I would have to say that the extra cost for the RR was worth it so far. For me and the troubles I had with the EV mapping, the app is very important to work well. I wasted so many hours having to remap the house multiple times. RR need to fix sequencing for schedules. I have a schedule that starts at 4am, i want the rooms furthest from the dock and bedrooms done first. It needs to be done in the map editing, but should be in the schedule which makes more sense. I only had my EV for 3-4 months and it is still early on for the RR. I accept that there is a teething period and so far I am happy with the RR. I think I would have been happy with the EV but I just couldn't trust it or their support after a bad experience before."
"S6 MaxV - question about the ventilation grilles in the backHi everyone! Lately, I've noticed a decrease in my S6 MaxV's vacuuming performance: dust bunnies and my cat's fur tend to NOT fill up the dustbin, rather they clump at the bin's inlet, plus overall suction is not what it used to be.

I noticed that of the two ventilation grilles in the back (those surrounding the water tank) only one seems to regularly work, no air blows out of the other. Can you owners of this model confirm whether this is normal or I should seek an RMA?

"Roborock S7 scratches the floorHello guys,

I have a new Roborock S7 for one month and it's cleaning performance is quite pleasing. Unfortunately I noticed that my whole wooden floor is scratched by now. The scratches are not that deep and you can only notice them in direct sunlight but I guess there is something wrong.

I heard that it could be the brush cover as it is made out of plastic. But maybe it is the mop cloth? I don't know. I would be really happy, if someone could help me :)"
"Hows about another S7 mopping thread, eh?I am experiencing very poor mopping performance with my S7.

Earlier today, I slapped a brand new mop pad on my recently new to me S7. This is my second S7 and this would be this unit's first out of the box mopping session. After vacuuming the hallway, I misted it with all purpose no residue floor cleaner and set it to mop only. With the out of the box cloth, dry, a full tank of water and lightly misted hallway it did an amazing job. Zero streaking. Nice even shine on the flat hardwood. The hallway is, maybe 80 square feet? The robot went back to dock after finishing. I decided to try my luck again in the dining room and so I moved the chairs away, lightly misted with cleaner and set up another zone mop. I should mention that both spaces were just vacuumed.

This time, when the bot finished with the dining zone mop and the floor dried, I was left with pretty bad horizontal streaking. These streaks were similar to what I experienced when I pre wet the mop before a session. The all purpose no residue floor cleaner is a recent addition which I picked up this tip from a post on this sub. As soon as the mop passes over the misted sections it seems to wet the entire mop sufficiently and the water tank does the rest. I get nice wide wet streaks while the robot is working.

How can I get my S7 to mop without streaking? What am I doing wrong? The hallway went great, but then the second zone, just minutes later was awful.

Also both S7's leave only a center water streak when mopping from dry.

We like the S7 and H6 just as much, as it is a fantastic alternative to our aging Dyson, but the S7's mopping performance is abysmal. I'm sure you've watched the same YouTube reviews I did, but my S7 is yet to actually remove a single light stain from our tiled kitchen.... or any surface for that matter. The streaks it leaves behind can't be missed.

**Edit:** BTW, thanks for the community for helping me sort out room division and sharing some good tips on mapping a few weeks back. New users, your map isn't complete until you've put in small no go's to really streamline the S7's journey around the house."
"French Review of the S7 MaxV Ultra[Here's the original, click for pictures](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/roborock-s7-max-v-ultra-p66755/test.html)

Google translated:

 **Roborock's S7 MaxV Ultra prides itself on being one of the most autonomous robots on the market.** **Delivered with an imposing base comprising three bins, it vacuums, washes, empties its collector and automatically cleans its mop.**

## Presentation

The S7 MaxV Ultra is a hybrid robot vacuum for vacuuming and mopping the floor. Even better, Roborock presents it as an almost autonomous device. Sold at €1399, it is the “ultra” of the range which, delivered with a charging station, relieves the user of less than stellar tasks. Composed of three bins, the base empties the waste collector, fills the robot's water tank if necessary and keeps the soiled one after cleaning. Originality of the product, this station is automatically responsible for washing its tray and mop. And to achieve unparalleled cleaning performance, the manufacturer has equipped its robot with sensors, a rangefinder, a camera, a 3D scanner and a mop with sonic vibrations.

&#x200B;

 

## Convenience of use (5 stars)

Roborock's latest has a futuristic look. Dressed in black and red, it measures less than 10 cm in height. Above all, the S7 MaxV Ultra is a compendium of technologies, and it shows! It is thus equipped with ReactiveAI 2.0 technology combining an RGB camera and a 3D scan. This would allow the robot to find its way around its environment and detect obstacles in its path. Its laser rangefinder helps it correctly map the environment and optimize the route. Finally, the S7 MaxV Ultra obviously has an armada of sensors to detect different types of surface, obstacles or prevent it from falling into the void in the presence of a staircase, for example. Thanks to these technologies, the navigation of the robot should be among the best.

 If Roborock communicates a lot about these many technologies, the charging station remains the major asset of the S7 MaxV Ultra; imposing with its 49 cm in height and 42 cm in depth and width. It thus makes it possible to minimize the maintenance carried out by the user. To do this, it carries three different bins. Two are intended for the washing function: one must be filled with clean water, while the second collects dirty water after washing.

 Concretely, the base automatically fills the water tank integrated into the robot (200 ml), wrings the mop during and after washing, then stores the soiled water in the second tank. If the [Yeedi Mop Station](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/robot-laveur-sol/yeedi-mop-station-p64729/test.html) and the [Dreame Bot W10](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/robot-laveur-sol/dreame-w10-p67407/test.html) also have bins of this type, they do not have a collector drain container. The base of Roborock – and this is the originality of the robot – is equipped with it. It is therefore no longer necessary to get your hands dirty to empty the collector. But the manufacturer does not stop there and has equipped the S7 MaxV Ultra with an automatic self-cleaning system on its base after a session.

Continuing around the owner, we spot the waste collector under the carcass of the S7 MaxV. With a capacity of 400 ml, it has a HEPA filter that traps small dust and thus reduces the risk of allergy or asthma. A large rubber brush and a small side brush, combined with a suction power of 5100 Pa, are responsible for sucking up waste and dust.

 The mop attaches under the robot and goes into the washing machine. As for the water tank, it is clipped to the back and it allows you to moisten the vibrating mop.

 Finally, we identify the control panel located on the cover of the robot. Very classic, it allows you to start a cleaning, pause it, send the S7 MaxV back to its base or ask it to undertake a targeted cleaning.

 

### Connectivity and app

The Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra pairs easily with the app. After searching for the device on the latter, a QR Code appears and must be flashed by the robot's camera: it connects to wifi and becomes operational.

The user is then offered a plethora of functionalities. Of course, it is possible to ask the robot to start cleaning, to pause it or to return to its base. The mop's suction and “rubbing” intensities can be adjusted according to the chosen mode: vacuuming and washing, vacuuming or washing. As with many robot vacuums, the Roborock app allows you to create virtual walls, no-go zones, cleaning zones and even customize rooms from A to Z. In short, the user is king.

The possible settings are so numerous that it is difficult to detail them all. The user can choose how often the mop is washed, enable or disable automatic bin emptying, or schedule sessions. The multi-stage option is also available and is very valuable.

As with the [Samsung Jetbot AI+](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/samsung-jet-bot-ai-vr50t95735w-wa-p65705/test.html) , the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra's on-board camera lets the user see what's going on at home. It is then possible to follow a cleaning in progress, to control the robot remotely using a remote control and even to call the robot! The user can then communicate with people nearby or with his pet.

The app provides a very complete experience, especially since the details of the mapping are really appreciable: the robot identifies the obstacles (an icon identifies them on the map), the different surfaces (such as carpets) and grays out the clusters of waste (such as our sawdust).

## Maintenance (4 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra's docking station is supposed to be very self-contained, but the facts diverge somewhat. First of all, we noticed that the automatic draining of the collector was far from efficient. After initiating our cleaning session, the robot returns to its base, which in turn sucks up the collected waste. We then manipulated the robot and noticed that waste was escaping from the collector. To find out for sure, we placed 150 g of rice in the belly of the device, then ordered to empty its collector automatically. Only 26.3 g of rice were sucked up… We repeated the operation with 50 g of sawdust this time. The results are then better, but unequivocally: only 30 g were recovered by the suction base.

The automatic mop cleaning is also somewhat disappointing. During cleaning and at the end of the cycle, the base of the Roborock takes care of cleaning the mop thanks to an integrated brush. Alas, the results remain mixed and we prefer to put the wipe in the washing machine for more efficiency (60°C for a perfect result).

In the same way, the base is supposed to clean itself, always using the brush. Despite this feature, we find the base plate very dirty after cleaning. In question, the many interstices present on the base.

The HEPA filter retains little dust. We weighed before/after sucking 20 g of cocoa. In the end, only 0.2g got into the filter.

We should also point out the efficiency of the automatic filling of the water tank integrated into the robot. Thanks to its clean water tank, the base fills it as soon as necessary, which allows the S7 MaxV Ultra to gain autonomy.

Finally, the rubber brush avoids the entanglement of hair and hair, knowing that a small tool is delivered with the robot to improve maintenance.

## Navigation system (4 stars)

As we have previously reported, the S7 MaxV Ultra is a compendium of technologies. Its sensors, its laser rangefinder and its pair of cameras should allow it to locate itself perfectly in any type of environment.

 We therefore wanted to verify Roborock's claims and scattered 100 g of sawdust in strategic places in our laboratory. The trajectory of the robot is strange: it sometimes cuts the room in two, sometimes lingers on the carpet. Either way, it circles the area first before zigzagging around.

Then comes the first difficulty: our fine carpet. It's a success: the robot passes over the carpet without difficulty and does not forget to raise its mop to avoid soaking it. Ditto, the chair bars are not obstacles for the S7 MaxV Ultra. On the other hand, it bypasses the curtains without going under them and considers them as walls.

We then decide to place objects in its path to observe its behavior. The S7 MaxV Ultra would indeed be able to recognize shoes, cables and even animal feces. Above all, the manufacturer ensures that his machine reacts differently according to what he perceives. The robot vacuum cleaner would approach shoes, but stay away from excrement, for example. Obviously, we did not carry out this test, but placed a water bottle, a tea towel and a power cable. Apart from the water bottle, the robot dragged the obstacles in its path, which is a bit disappointing given the promise.

Finally, we place the robot in the dark. A front light comes on to light the way. Its route is quite methodical, but the robot seems to take detours from time to time and sometimes finds itself in difficulty in the face of certain obstacles.

## Suction (4 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra has a suction power of 5100 Pa (pascals), a wide brush and a side brush. This trio gives hope for more than adequate suction performance. This was the case on hard ground and fine carpet, in boost or normal mode.

On thick carpet, however, the test thickens. The device manages to collect 70% of the scattered rice in normal mode and 72% in boost mode. If this coating is particularly difficult for robot vacuum cleaners, this Roborock does not stand out on this test. For comparison, the [Dreame L10 Pro](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/dreame-l10-pro-p64593/test.html) , one of the last tested by *Les Numériques* , had sucked up 82% of the waste.

We tested the S7 MaxV Ultra as a robot vacuum, not a floor scrubber. The procedure therefore does not include washing efficiency. However, Roborock's strong communication around the versatility of the device prompted us to double down on our testing. Find the results in the news lab link.

## Autonomy (5 stars)

The S7 MaxV Ultra ranks in the middle of our [comparison](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/comparatif-choisir-meilleur-aspirateur-robot-a1555.html) and requires just over 3 hours to fully recharge. In standard mode, the robot is placed in the high average and vacuums for 2 h 51 min. It is also one of the longest-lasting devices in boost mode since it cleans for 1 hour 40 minutes.

## Noise (2 stars)

If it does not break the ears, the robot is not the quietest. In standard mode, it reaches 62 dB (A) against 54 dB (A) for the [iRobot Roomba J7+](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/aspirateur-robot/irobot-roomba-j7-p64987/test.html) . The robot vacuum even goes up to 66 dB (A) when set to its maximum power.  

## STRONG POINTS

* Good suction performance.
* Quick recharge time.
* Good autonomy.
* Full app.
* Automatic filling of the water tank integrated into the robot.

## WEAK POINTS

* Improving obstacle management.
* Sloppy 2-in-1 features.

 

Conclusion (5 stars):

**The S7 MaxV Ultra is presented by Roborock as a hybrid device capable of vacuuming, washing and automatically managing its maintenance.** **However, if the suction performance is more than correct, there is a downside.** **The docking station is indeed very messy and does not manage to clean itself, whether at the level of its base, its mop or concerning the emptying of the collector.** **The vibrating mop, it (and like on many other devices), is only figurative.** **The S7 MaxV Ultra is certainly an excellent vacuum cleaner, but seems to rush its other features.** **It is therefore far from being considered a 2-in-1 robot worthy of the name.**"
"Is the S7 main brush an overall downgrade from brushes with bristles, or only worse with pet hair?I'm thinking about returning the S6 MaxV I recently bought and grabbing an S7, since the black friday price is basically what I paid for mine. Reading posts about the S7's main brush performing poorly on carpet gives me pause though. I'm struggling to understand the rationale for an all-silicone roller brush when nobody was really complaining about the older design with both bristles and silicone fins. What's the advantage? 

My dog doesn't shed, so I'm not worried about hairs that seem to be the cause of a lot of complaints, but almost half of my surfaces are rug or carpet, so the better mopping and mop raising feature might not be worth it if the carpet/rug performance is worse overall."
"Quick Self-Emptying Bin ReviewI ordered the self-emptying base from Wal-Mart and to my surprise it showed up at my doorstep yesterday. I figure I’d share my thoughts about it, in case it helps anyone else make a decision. Long story short, I like it, and while I think the Roomba base is better, this is a killer feature as a pet owner.


Delivery/Assembly:

The box that it came in was simply gigantic, so be prepared for that. Not a big deal. It comes with a short set of assembly instructions, basically screw in a few screws to attach the base plate to the canister, swap the bin in the robot with the included self-emptying bin (and pop out a plastic tab from the robot itself which covers the air inlet). PROTIP: If you have a Phillips screwdriver, use that instead of the suggested tool on the bottom of the robot. They include an Allen key with a Phillips head and it’s not ergonomic and I almost stripped a screw.

Usage:

-	Docking performance: It’s a little dicey compared to the home base. Often times when returning home, my S7 is backing out and trying again to get on the docking base, or freaking out and half falling off the base before trying again. It hasn’t failed YET but the way it docks just doesn’t look confident.
-	Clean base emptying noise: It’s actually a little quieter than the iRobot self-emptying base but it is still loud. It sounds like Grandma’s Oreck vacuum. It runs for about 15-20 seconds.
-	Emptying performance: My house has a lot of dog hair and carpet fuzz, and I found that it was able to completely evacuate the bin every time for my typical cleaning jobs. With that said, I tested some Lake Tahoe coarse sand and a few pennies and it wasn’t able to evacuate them out of the bin. The iRobot one can handle large debris like this too. TLDR: iRobot’s self empty bin is literally as good as manually emptying the bin, and you can set-it-and-forget it for months or longer without manually emptying the bin. The RoboRock one does pretty well for every day dust/lint/hair, but it might leave behind bigger pieces that require manual emptying at some point in the future.


Other Thoughts/Limitations:

-	The “self emptying bin” (the bin in the robot) seems screwed closed. You can’t really open it by the front flap to empty it manually. I didn’t try too hard to figure out how it’s shut, but be aware that it’s not trivially easy to use the self-emptying bin manually.
-	There are no “bin full” sensors so if you have an extremely dirty floor, RoboRock’s solution will not periodically go back to the station to empty and then resume the cleaning job. iRobot has a bin-full sensor so that it knows in the middle of a job when it needs to go empty itself. RoboRock on a dirty carpet will just run through the whole job even if the bin is full a few minutes into the cleaning job.


Conclusion:
Overall this is a worthwhile and functional accessory so you don’t have to remember to empty the bin after every single cleaning job. My biggest gripe is that it doesn’t auto-empty in the middle of a job when the bin gets full, because when you first get a robovac the bin fills up super fast the first few jobs and that’s something that the Roomba solution handles automagically for you, while with a RoboRock IMO you will still need to babysit a bit the first few jobs or just run a bunch of jobs where it only meaningfully cleans the first few minutes.

The other little issues either aren’t dealbreakers or they seem fixable in software."
"Do you think the S7 is going to drop in price massifely when the S7 maxv comes out?Im still using the xiaomi v1 robotvacuum (7 years now) and it does the job still but the battery is getting worse and we want to upgrade to mopping.

"Anyone come from Roomba S9+?Hi all -

Curious on everyone’s thoughts. I currently have the Roomba S9+ with M6 mop and this thing is a literal piece of crap. I’ve gone through 5 warranty replacements for different issues - damaged parts, smoke coming out of one, broken speaker. Not to mention this thing is completely dumb - it gets stuck on cords, blankets, dog toys. Every time I run a job - it will always get stuck at some point. (Maybe that’s part blame on me for making sure everything was cleared off the floors ahead of time - but imo that defeats the purpose of this.) The only plus is that the cleaning performance is kind of decent. It vacuums (and M6 mops) floors great and carpet even better. But at this point I am beyond done with the Roomba brand and I’m looking for a good alternative. Has anyone done the change? Currently looking at the S7+ but considering waiting for a sale or the S7 MaxV. (Money isn’t a concern - just want choosing the best product for the best price.) 

&#x200B;

Have a few questions -

1) How is edge performance on the S7? The Roomba has a D shape design, so I fear the  with its circular design won’t get the edges in my apartment. (Which there is a lot of curves and a bay windows)

3) How it the cleaning and mopping performance compared to S9 if anyone has experience? I saw a few videos on youtube and it looks like the S9 might beat it out slightly. 

4) Does Roborock ever get stuck over cords, blankets, dog toys, etc? Curious if the lidar makes a big difference or not. 

5) Should I be waiting for the S7 MaxV?

&#x200B;

About me - Small apartment but plan on moving to a bigger house soon. I also have a dog that sheds a lot!"
"Reset wifi resets maps?Hi, I am needing to change the wifi network that my Roborock S5Max is paired with.

When performing the reset procedure (power + home button until blinking), does that also erase any saved maps? If so, is there a way to reset the wifi without resetting maps?

It took quite a bit of doing to get a comprehensive house map done for my vacuum and I'm not eager to do it again."
"S7+ auto empty dock AustraliaJust had my S7+ Auto empty dock arrive to me from a Australian seller and can confirm that it is both Cyclone (bag less) or bagged. Can be swapped between either with relative ease. 

Haven't had a chance to test the performance as yet as our ""maggiebot"" is currently doing its scheduled clean. Think it'll have a hell of a shock when it returns home to find a brand new shiny auto Empty dock."
"Everything RIGHT with RoborockRoborock is by far my favorite robot vacuum company, and here is why:  


\-Amazing Build Quality! The new S7 is heavier than the top-of-the-line Roomba S9+. This suggests amazing build quality. Even the Auto-Empty Dock is heavy.

\-Regular App and Robot Vacuum updates. The app is always updated with new features that satisfy their customers, and most of the robot vacuums receive regular updates as well. Other brands can't promise that, especially the Neato Robotics Brand.

\-Regular product releases. In 2021, Roborock released a total of 7 products: The S7, T7S, T7S Plus, E5, H7, U10 (Dyad in China), and G10. Products coming out very soon are the S7 MaxV, S7 MaxV Plus, S7 MaxV Ultra, Q7 Max, X7 WashVac, and Dyad.

\-Precise Navigation. Even the crazy expensive Roomba S9+ still uses outdated cameras to navigate. Roborock uses LiDAR which they might not have pioneered but might've perfected. They did pioneer live tracking, which is standard in LiDAR robots today.

\-Cleaning performance. What's more important is cleaning performance, which Roborock excels at, especially with their S7.

\-They listen to us. I believe Roborock goes through a lot of suggestions by users to create a new robot that people will love.

\-They take their time. If you look deeper into Roborock products, you might notice how much effort they take into creating a good product. Take the Dyad, with 3 mopping rollers, or the Auto-Empty Dock which is sucked out from the front. They take a lot of time to do the right thing, not rushing to the market.

\-Wide range of models. From the affordable E series to the mid-range Q series to the high-end S series, there is a roborock to love for everyone."
"PSA: USE COMPRESSED AIR!!I made a post a couple days ago about issues with “filter wet/blocked” errors I’ve been getting constantly for about a week. I clean the S7 as directed and clean the filter every time it tells me to, actually probably a little more.  

Always wash it and let it dry for 24 hours. The vacuum looked new. Yet kept getting the error. At the advice of this place got some canned air and tried it and not only did it immediately fix the error message the bot performed as good as day 1… all from just using canned air on the filter. Also gets rid of the having to wait 24 hours to be able to use it. 

Kind of insane they don’t recommend this when following the Roborock instruction specifically led to errors in normal use. 

Hope this helps!"

"First Robot Vacuum in 2022 - S5 Max?Hey,
For the past week I have been reading extensive reviews on robot vacuum cleaners since I want to purchase my first one. 
Up until now I have been very skeptical but have decided to give it a shot. 

Is S5 Max still worth getting for me to enter the robot vacuum world? 
The mopping functionality is not crucial for me and neither is the docking station capability, in this scenario the most valuable is S5 Max if I have understood it correctly? Any input is appreciated. 

S5M costs me about $400, and S7 about $600…."
"S7 root?Has there been any progress in rooting the S7? Mainly interested in if the S7 uses the same password algorithm as the S6. I'm comfortable opening it up and finding the serial port, messing with u-boot, etc, but no point opening her up and voiding the warranty if there's no way to get access yet.

Loving the performance, but I definitely want to run open source firmware on it eventually. I use OpenHab for all my automation and don't like the idea of any cloud company having access to my home, especially not a China based one."
"Roborock S7+ vs. Dreametech Z10 Pro [x-post from /r/RobotVacuums]TL;DR Which auto-emptying robot vacuum cleans low/medium-pile carpet the best, handles long-ish hair decently, has a mop that’s not terrible, and has software that won’t require multiple re-mappings?


Hi all, another request for the “best” robot vacuum/mop. I recently purchased the Ecovacs Deebot N8 Pro+, but I’m not too happy with its buggy mapping issues. So I’m looking to replace it with one that cleans well and has better software.

I’ve seen some reviews about both the Roborock S7+ and the Dreametech Z10 Pro, but I haven’t seen much that directly compares the two – would anyone happen to have any insight there? I have both carpet and tile. A good mop would be nice, but I understand that stuck-on stains would require more work than dragging a wet microfiber cloth across the floor, even if it vibrates. I don’t mind if I just need to run a second round of mopping, though. That said, I think better carpet cleaning is somewhat more important to me.

Cleaning tests I’ve found online have somewhat conflicting results. For example, the individual reviews from BestCordlessVacuumGuide indicate that the S7 cleans marginally better than the Z10 Pro in all its tests except in “deep cleaning” where the Z10 Pro performed just a little better, but generally that site shows the two cleaned pretty similarly overall.

On the other hand, ModernCastle tests show the Z10 Pro performing significantly worse than the S7. I don’t know how reputable/thorough either of these sites are, so it’s hard to discern if the S7’s higher price point is really worth it. I know that VacuumWars recommends the S7+ but I haven’t seen a review there for the Z10 Pro. Feels like I’ve been going in circles for a while, so I’d greatly appreciate any help!

"Low battery!Super happy about the performance of our S7 but it stops cleaning at 20% battery life, and refuses to go further. Is there any way to go around this?"
"Does S7 self-emptying dock also remove dirt from rollersHi, I've been reading about the new S7 /S7 maxv rollers scratching floors if the dirt is not  removed from the rubber brushes.  So... can anyone tell me if the self-emptying dock manages to remove the dirt from the rubber rollers? Also, does the filter also get cleaned?"
"Roborock S6- Error 10 Clogged Filter - the real causeSo I’ve had my S6 for about 18 months now and about 6 months ago it started complaining about error 10 filter is clogged, that’s fairly well reported on this model

I purchased new filters, cleaned the dustbin, even blew out the robot with an airline.  Each time within a few weeks the error was back

So I stripped down my S6 to find out why.  Takes about an hour to do but is pretty straightforward.

The cause?  The intake to the motor was almost totally blocked with dirt and hair.

Once cleaned and reassembled the S6 is performing like new again.

I’ve had to do this twice now, both times the same cause and result.

I’ve 2 dogs, tiled floor and the S6 is used everyday.

In my view this represents a design flaw on the S6 which allows dirt to get trapped on the motor intake and prevents the robot working well.  Wouldn’t be such an issue if it didn’t take so long to get to the motor to fix.

I’ve got a 10 year old Roomba too and never had any such issues.

"Roborock S7Hi y'all, I just ordered my S7 for $491.90 and I have some questions. I saw on videos and from other peoples feedback that mapping first time takes really really long, because it has to navigate around the house. A YT video suggests using the navigate feature to make this faster. What is the best way to carry out the mapping. Should I leave things as be or should I move some things up before sending it out to map first time? Basically what is the best/most reliable way to map the S7 so it performs its best?"
"Roborock T7sThe T7S series is a newly designed sweeping and mopping unit with automatic dust collection. The T7S has a new carpet recognition sensor on top of the existing sensor on the bottom of the T7S, which sends out ultrasonic waves to accurately identify carpets and floors, and to control the lift of the mopping unit (up to 5mm above the floor) according to the current working conditions. At the bottom of the T7S, where the vibrating mop holder is mounted, there is an additional metal rod assembly which drives the vibrating area of the mop to swing left and right to wipe the floor, with a high frequency vibration of 3000 vibrations per minute achieved by the high performance brushless motor, easily dismantling stubborn dirt on the floor. Another major upgrade to the Stone T7S is the new design of the main brush module. The main brush is now a flexible TPU brush with 5 long and 5 short brushes to ensure the best possible air pressure and dust removal. In addition, it reduces the problem of static electricity when cleaning carpets. The dust collection station has been upgraded from the secondary 9-cone cyclone separation on the stone handheld hoover to a larger 15-cone cyclone for efficient separation without loss and is certified by the TÜV Rheinland for no loss of suction power. In addition, the dust collector has a triple separation filtration system with cyclone separation, pre-filter and HEPA filter of class H13, resulting in clean exhaust air and avoiding secondary pollution of the vacuum equipment. It is worth mentioning that this dust collector is currently the only one on the market that can achieve H13 air purifier level filtration. Finally, as for the T7S series purchase advice, the T7S and T7S Plus have the same basic functions, the same sweeping and mopping capabilities, the T7S Plus has an additional Reactive 3D structured light obstacle avoidance system, which is more capable of avoiding small objects such as toys and messy cables. For those with less clutter on the floor and no pets or babies, the more cost-effective Stone sweeper and mopper T7S is recommended.

"Looking for S6 MaxV Poop Avoidance FeedbackSo our RoboRock S6 (not MaxV) just rolled through and distributed dog shit throughout our entire first floor for the second time in two weeks and third time total. (Our dogs refuse to shit outside during heavy rain and/or thunderstorms.)

I started searching for if there was a robot vacuum that is smart enough to avoid shit and the first result is the S6 MaxV. I really wish that had been advertised more prominently as I would have bought the more expensive model in a heartbeat over the standard S6.

Are there any S6 MaxV owners out there who can provide some feedback on this feature? Just looking for how the poop avoidance performs before spending not a small amount just to get that feature, which is not available in our current S6. I've seen the review videos on it, but would love to here how it performs over a longer period of time than a few test runs.

I'd love to avoid cleaning more fecal matter out of the S6 again. Thanks!"
"New S6 MaxJust got and set up my new S6 Max. Works like a dream. Brush is definitely spinning non stop on my low pile carpet.  The obstacle avoidance is great. Maps the room really well and does a great job cleaning. 

&#x200B;

Overall, very happy with it's performance so far and very glad I've had no issues with the bruch not spinning on carpet."
"Help with mappingHey guys,

We just got our Roborock S7 yesterday, and have been really impressed with the performance. 

I have some trouble with the map it made, some rooms it doesnt go in to at all. I tried to block some of, so it was forced to go in, but it doesnt go into them.

Its room 1-5. Room 2 has a high doorstep, so I could imagine we need a ramp for that, but all others have regular doorstep, like the doorstep i have put up a wall at now. Any ideas on how to add them?

Also @6 there is nothing at all? The wall stops where it moved to. Kinda weird.

Really hope you guys can help out, and thanks in advance! :)

"Robot Vacuums & Mopping- do you guys actually use it/Hi everyone,

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I'm looking to buy my first robot vacuum (cleaning for yourself is so 2010) and I've done various research on the products on the market but I'm struggling to pick the best for me.

Between all of the various options, one of the biggest factors seems to be if they have a mop/mopping feature or not.

Do you guys actually use the mop? or not? - it seems that some robot vacuums without a mop might perform better than those that have a mop, so it would be good to know if you guys that have them actually use the mop too!

Any other tips for a first time robot buyer and things to look out for appreciated, of course I will continue to do my own research

cheers!

"Roborock scraping floorsHello, I just want to make everyone aware of a design flaw that caused the roborock to scratch floors. I contacted them once I noticed it and after googling others have had the exact same scratches on their floors. They told me to contact the seller basically refusing to inspect the unit so they could improve the product and stop selling something that damages floors. I otherwise was thrilled the performance and shocked and saddened when I saw the damage it did. Hopefully this will prevent it from happening to others floors. Under the unit on the cover for the rollers is two wires, in the stronger suction modes the unit is pulled down to the floor and the “v” bend of the wire drags the floor. Any sand , dirt etc.. grinds into the flor in perfectly straight lines. This is very noticible in direct sunlight . There was another thread on this earlier where the picture they posted showed the damage well on their dark floors. Please. Inspect your units and check it is not happening to you.

"Best value Lidar model for fully carpeted floor?So, my dad and I moved into a new house recently, and I got him to cave on an S7 for our bottom floor which is almost entirely hardwood. We absolutely love it, but it has had the unforeseen consequence of putting our old Roomba to shame. I ran it on our top floor, which is almost all carpet, for the first time today, and it just doesn't measure up. The actual vacuuming wasn't amazing and it completely missed the master bedroom, which just isn't gonna work.

So we're in the market for another Roborock, specifically one with Lidar so that it actually knows what it's doing, and good vacuum performance; mopping isn't necessary at all. We aren't on a tight budget, but would like to get the best bang for our buck. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"
"Mopping IssueHello, I am using roborock for more than year. But almost 3 or 4 months my roborock is terrible on mopping. You can see there is 2 photos on attachment 1. For only sweeping it is really good. But when it makes mopping really bad performance. It circles and go different places. I bought cover for main wheels but still same, noting going good. What can I do to make it same performans while mopping ? I want it smooth mopping

"My S5 max actually does suckI've had my S5 max for about 6 weeks (?)  For the first 4 or 5 days it worked brilliantly. I had it on the lowest suction setting and it did a wonderful job picking up my pet's hair. I'd go over a room with a fine tooth comb and rarely could find a hair. After less than a week I noticed a big drop off in performance. It would go over bunches of hair and essentially do nothing.   
So, I became much more diligent about cleaning out the filter way more often.   
The result? There was improved performance but not by much. 

So now, 6 weeks on I thoroughly clean/wash the filter regularly and now put the vac on the highest suction setting. It does decent job picking up hair/dirt, but definitely not like the first week I had it.  The brush seems to be turning properly and the spinny thing spins as it should. But there's always some hair left behind. I'm ok with a bit of hair, but it's too much to justify spending this much money. My floors are wood and linoleum. It's worse on the linoleum...maybe static electricity? It's absolutely useless for picking up any hair on rugs. But that's probably too much to ask. Should the spinning brush actually touch the floor? I'm quite sure it doesn't, but I could be wrong.   


How  often do you clean your filter? It's the only thing I've done that seems to have a positive impact on performance."
"Honest opinions from folks who've had Roomba s9+ and Roborock s7Hi everyone, this is a great community. I currently have a Roomba s9+, but have become more and more interested in the Roborock s7. We have a mixture of hardwood, tile and carpet ( as well as area rugs). I do love the auto-emptying on my Roomba, but I don't love certain things like the constant replacement of the brush extractors and sometimes wonky navigation. If I did go with the s7, I would probably spring for the self-empty bin for that.

&#x200B;

My questions-if anyone here has had both, is which did you find performed better in terms of debris pickup, navigation, maintenance, baby-sitting it (stuck, errors, etc.)? I've watched review videos but I thought i'd reach out to the community for some real insight. Thanks, guys!"
"S7 poor results on carpet (pet hair) - Upgrade main brush?Hi everbody! My S7 performs sub-par on carpets, especially with cat hair. I understand that due to the design of the main brush the performance on carpets is not very good.

In the back of my mind I remember someone saying that the S6 brush with the actual brush-elements would fit into the S7 as well. Is this true or did I get something wrong there? If so, does anyone have experience with this kind of replacement? Does it work?"
"S6 newest firmwareHello guys. 

I have an S6 and since the last firmware update,  01.27.00 my S6' performance is just bad. Also the English voice had been changed, I don't like it and it's partial, there are many things that are being said by the old one, but that's not the problem. It cleans almost every day in the same room. It misses spots, bumps into the same obstacles at the very same place many times and at the start of the cleaning session it takes like 5 minutes for it to figure out where it is. Before the update it was just a 180 degree turn and it knew which room it was in. Now it almost goes trough the whole room until it can finally figure it out where it is. Can I maybe rollback updates? Or should I do a factory reset and see what happens?"
EcovacsI know we prefer Roborock in this sub but I'm seeing some deals on a few Ecovacs robot vacuums and I'm wondering how they perform compared to Roborock. Mainly the higher end Ecovacs models. Anyone have experience or knowledge in this?
"S6 Max Pure > S6 MaxV Disappointing UpgradeMy first robot vacuum was the S6 Pure and it blew me away with how great it was.  The one thing I didn't like was not so great at object detection because well it cant, and the mop is a joke.

Decided to upgrade to the S6 MaxV thinking it would help in all these areas, while upgrading in speed, battery life, and overall performance.

What I got was a vacuum that seems louder, takes actually a bit longer to clean, still eats wires, and worst of all I swear it does not pick up as much. 

It has suction and the brush bar is working, so I do not get it.

The AI and cameras in my case seem to do no good at all for the unit, and the battery life doesn't seem any better either.

Anyone else have a similar experience?  I wonder if something is simply ""bad"" about my unit but I cant see any obvious signs of that.  It still works, just not very well."
S6 Pure - Avoiding carpet when mopping?I just got the S6 Pure and so far very happy with it's vacuum performance. Just wondering how to approach the mopping side of things. The whole floor is timber laminate floorboards with rugs in certain areas. Do I have to manually set up no-go zones for these? Or will the bot automatically detect carpet and not go there? I know it can't lift the mop for carpeted areas but I'm not looking to mop and vacuum at the same time.
"Roborock S7 - Wrong brush fin direction?Hi,

&#x200B;

 This is somewhat of an extension to my post from a few days ago: [Roborock S7 Poor Performance/Pickup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/mid9vm/roborock_s7_poor_performancepickup/)

&#x200B;

I thought I would try 1 more cleaning before deciding on if I should return the S7 or not (definitely thinking I need to return it).

&#x200B;

I took out the brush roller to make sure it was clean before the final run and I noticed something odd. 

&#x200B;

I am in no way a vacuum designer and I could be completely wrong on this. But the angle of the fins on the S7's brush almost seems like it's completely backwards. The fins are bent opposite/away from the direction of spin so I really can't see how they would ""scoop"" debris towards the vacuum inlet. I think in high friction cases, like carpet, they would just giveway/bend. 

&#x200B;

I took the following 2 pictures:

&#x200B;

**Brush Inserted Regularly**

[https://imgur.com/jPnxkaQ](https://imgur.com/jPnxkaQ)

&#x200B;

**Brush Inserted Backwards (Doesn't fit this way)**

[https://imgur.com/OYHlUhI](https://imgur.com/OYHlUhI)

To me it almost seems like the fin direction in the ""Inserted Backwards"" picture makes a lot more sense than how it works today.

&#x200B;

Would be interested in hearing other's thoughts on this. And is everyone's S7 brush fins like mine?"
"Cleaning solution on pad?I have dark (chocolate) hardwood floors and I worry about whether using wage only will perform poorly while mopping.

Roborock says not to put cleaning solution int the water reservoir because it will corrode the internals. Fair enough. But what about soaking the mopping pad with a floor cleaning solution before you run the mopping program? Since they recommend starting with a wet pad it would seem a smart move to use a cleaning solution.

Has anyone done this? how well does it work?"
"Is it possible to change cleaning step on S5 Max?When cleaning Roborock performs parallel passes across the room with interval of ≈30cm.
This is fine while vacuuming but not enough while mopping. Is there any advanced setting which world advise Roborock to have step about 15 cm?"
"Roborock app update is availableon the Play Store.

Version 2.3.16
1. Improved stability and performance.
2. Squashed some bugs."
"Main Brush IssuesI posted in the past to find out if the FW update solved this issue but got a lot of anecdotal, confirmation bias, opinions from roborock fans who seem to need to justify their buying decision but nothing factual, so I started researching.

You see, I owned an s6maxV and sent two back after having what I thought were issues with the main brush.

Long story short, RR told me about the stalling issue and suggested another model. S7.

Then I bought a Dreame L10 which was great (cleans well, but support seemed suspect, and the app is not as good as RR. I purchased via a reseller who Dreame would not directly support, so I returned it... if you buy this, buy it directly from Dreame)

I spoke to RR support Monday to ask again for advice about which CURRENT model to get for mid-pile carpet. (My home is 80% carpet) The prime day was here, and I need to get a robot vacuum, and RR had some decent but not amazing deals.

I was told the following by RR:

For the main brush issue, there is a protection system in the robot sent via FW to avoid internal system damage. (Well documented past issue with this) The FW update was the fix.

When the brush faces high friction like on a carpet for a certain period, the brush will stop running to protect the robot.

https://youtu.be/aIJXERoA8cA

The pause is temporary, and the brush WILL resume running. The process will cycle if the brush keeps facing high friction. Additionally, the suction strength will increase to max automatically when the robot reaches the carpet if you have enabled the carpet mode.

The gearbox and brush are the same in the s4max, s5max, S6maxv, and s7

I asked if my 1st refurbished model had a lessor motor, and I was told there was never a change made to the gearbox in production units, refurbished units are tested, and the behavior seen in the video I provided was consistent with the expected performance post FW update and the 2nd NEW unit that was sent.

The hope is the rubber s7 brush will not stick, BUT it will not pick up carpet hair as well as the bristle brushes models. (She noticed I had a dog in my video, PM me and I can share the videos)

Support mentioned that the brush does not need to spin consistently to clean the carpets adequately. The combination of suction and brush rotation and multiple passes will clean the carpets.

The RR rep added the combination of pile length AND material lead to friction which caused motors to burn out prior to the update.

RR said the prior s4 and s5 models did not receive the same FW update and are more susceptible to motor burnout, and the S4max was raised higher to help combat motor burnout. 

I would guess other lessor brands with similar designs have similar issues. RR is just large enough to have engineers develop a solution

My 360 s9 gave me the main brush stuck message every ten runs, and their solution was to cut the rubber fins off the brush. (Sent that one back)

RR support is excellent and responsive. 

I am JUST reporting what I was told; if you would like confirmation, please call or email RR.

Since my environment is mainly carpet and Amazon prime day had a great sale on the I6, I bought one. Excited to see how cleaning performance and navigation compare

Trolls, no need to respond. Yes, I did edit this message to provide a more complete recap and correct a few typos."
"Multi-floor mappingI am TRYING to decide between the RR, both 6 series or 5 Max, the 360 7pro or 9, or the Ozmo  T5 or best buy T8) despite hearing about the buggy APP.

Cleaning performance and Multi-floor mapping are important, as is a stable App. 

I called ECOVAC customer service and asked them the following question about multiple floor plans: ""If I map the 1st floor of my home, then need to map the 2nd what the process is?

I was ***shocked*** to hear the following answer:

To use ***ANY multi*** ***Mapping*** OZMO robot (***INCLUDING ALL T SERIES robots)*** on different floors/maps, you must:

1. Map the 1st floor,
   1. start robot from the dock,
   2. map it, save the map,
   3. add no go lines, etc.
   4. Power off Robot,
2. Move the robot and the dock to the new (2nd) floor.
   1. Create a new map, save it,
   2. Add no go lines, etc.
   3. Power off robot
3. Move it and the dock back to the 1st floor.
   1. Place dock & robot back in the same place before and power up and clean, etc.
4. When you want to clean the 2nd floor, you must
   1. Power off Robot
   2. Move Robot **AND** dock back to the same place it was when the robot mapped the 2nd floor.
   3. Power on the robot and run
      1. Robot MUST return to Dock.
      2. Power off before moving
5. The process must be repeated each time the robot is moved between floors as the dock must be recognized ***IN*** the location at which maps were 1st built.

If this is true, ECOVACS are not an option as the Multimap process for the 360 is as follows:

**360 Multi-floor Maps Management:**

If you want to use the multi-floor maps management, please make sure you move the charging dock and robot vacuum to the new environment. Let the robot vacuum start cleaning from the charging dock, complete a whole-house cleaning, and go back to the charging dock on itself. Once the new map has been saved, next time, no matter which floor you want it to clean, select the map for the floor, it would figure out the most efficient way for cleaning.

**RoboRock Owners**

Is the process the same as the 360?

Side note: I heard about NON-spinning main brushes on RR models. After doing some research, it was a bad batch of RR and has been resolved."
"S5 Max in Europe, buy now or wait for a discount?After a long research I decided to buy the S5 Max as it seems to be the best price/performance one. I can see that it costs around €400 on most stores with cheapest being 380€.

Do these ever get on a discount? Should I wait for some possible Christmas discounts or just buy now?

Edit: Just bought one from Aliexpress for €320!"
"s5 Max - Mopping QuestionHey all,

Recently got an s5 Max. Really happy with the performance so far. Vacuuming works as advertised and I am well impressed.

However, I have yet to try the mopping feature. I would like to, but just have an issue.

My kitchen and living areas are tiled but do have rugs/mats.

Will the robot detect these maps and stop mopping or do I have to try and set a no-go zone roughly where the mats/rugs are? This might be difficult.

Anyone else got any advice or feedback on this?

Thanks in advance."
"Best RoboRock for medium-high pile carpetApologies if this has already been addressed...but...

I recently made the decision to buy an S4. It's *amazing* on hardwoods and low-pile carpet (most of my downstairs) but I've noticed that it performs HORRIBLY (constant errors/getting confused/stuck) on the 1 room downstairs with medium-high pile carpet. I can live with manually cleaning this one room (that never gets used really) but I'm also looking to purchase a 2nd RoboRock to be used upstairs... which is *ALL* carpet. So my question: Is there a RoboRock model that's better suited for medium-high pile carpeting? I've got no interest in mopping capability and would prefer to keep Lidar mapping.

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks!"
"S4 max vs S6So I got a roborock E4 and love it but now I'm thinking of upgrading because I want mapping and the ability to block off spaces. I have dogs, tile dowstairs and medium pile carpet up. The S4 max is 359 now and s6 Is 429, I've heard mopping isn't great anyways so other that that is the s6 worth the price bump?"
"Is it true that S5 Max cleans better than S6 MaxV ?Trying to decide between the two options and this review from a seemingly trustworthy site says S5 Max performs better than S6MaxV in both AirFlow and Cleaning Tests.  
What has been your experience ?  


[https://www.bestcordlessvacuumguide.com/roborock-s5-max-vs-s6-maxv/](https://www.bestcordlessvacuumguide.com/roborock-s5-max-vs-s6-maxv/)"
"Roborock S6 First ImpressionsI received my S6 yesterday and ran it for the first time today. Maybe it’s partly the general fascination, but wow do I already love this thing! I was completely prepared to go with the S5 Max, but an amazon sale put them at about the same price, so I went with the S6 for the slightly quieter rating and slightly larger dust bin. This subreddit helped greatly in my research, so I thought I’d contribute my two cents as well. Long post ahead...

Context:
Per the roborock app the little dude mapped and cleaned 764 sq ft in 79 minutes, consuming about 46% of the battery in balanced mode. Our house is very compartmentalized, with doorway sized entries between the living room, kitchen, and hallway, with 3 bedrooms and 2 small bathrooms. No stairs, all hardwood with a few small low-pile area rugs. I have long hair, a dog that sheds constantly, and a bird that spreads fluff and seeds all around. 

Key points:
- Pretty impressed with its initial mapping. Watching it navigate around corners and table legs and gently bump around stray shoes was a thing of beauty. It did try for a while to get out the front door. Maybe because we had it open to  the all-glass storm door and it could “see” the front porch? It eventually gave up and moved on. 

- Very satisfied with the noise level on balanced mode. We’re currently working from home and wanted something that wouldn’t be intrusive. Definitely quieter than a normal vacuum and easy to ignore. I wouldn’t want it running in the bedroom at night, but cleaning the rest of the house overnight probably wouldn’t be an annoyance. 

- It cruised right onto all the area rugs, including our currently unsecured doormat that slides around if you breathe on it. I could hear the suction amp up for carpet mode each time. 

- It picked up all visible debris, a ton of hair and dust bunnies. The side brush didn’t seem to fling anything too far. 

- It did get hung up on a few cords and shoe laces, mostly my fault for not picking them up, but definitely something to keep in mind. 

- We haven’t vacuumed for about a week prior to this, and the dust bin was completely full by the end. As such I would say the last room may not have been cleaned as thoroughly, but it’s also the least used room so I couldn’t see a visibly lower performance there. I’m fully confident if run a few times a week the dustbin capacity should be just fine.

- There was also a ton of hair wrapped around the side brush, but didn’t stop it from spinning. The main brush had minimal hair wrapped up in it, less than our normal vacuum. 

- It did have trouble finding the dock when finished. It made weird laps around every room on the way back for about 10 minutes. I finally paused it, put it a foot in front of the dock and resumed, and it found it then. 

Overall I’m really happy with the first run. No mopping yet but we’ll give that a whirl soon enough!"
"S5 Max Mopping questionI'm trying to decide between the S4 and the S5 Max (basically do we want to pay for mopping). 

Our house is almost entirely vinyl plank. The surface has very fine grooves (I guess that synthetic wood feel?). While aesthetically pleasing, this surface can cause food to or spills to get down into the very small grooves (small kids are messy).

Does anyone have experience with the S5 Max mopping on this or similar textured hard surface?

If the mopping would be considered ""just ok"" in this application, I may just opt for the S4 given the value and good vacuum performance, sticking with a manual wet mop.

Input highly welcome!"
"Roborock S5 Max v/s Ecovacs Ozmo 950 and Ecovacs T8 AIVI (Especially mopping)After reading several reviews I’m convinced that S5 Max comes with a better UI/app experience. But, there aren’t many reviews comparing the mopping performance of these 3 robots.  
 I don’t mind spending an additional $100 for the Oscillating Pro mop if it truly does better than the S5 Max.

Thoughts ? Has anyone bought both and compared ?"
"S4 vs S5 max for corners and edges?I'm looking to buy my first robot vacuum and I landed on Roborock after watching (far too much) vacuum wars on YouTube.

I'm currently undecided between the S4 and S5 max. Mopping would be great, but the main factor for me is how well the vacuum does with corners and edges. See, [my cat](https://i.imgur.com/rqJQhSU.jpg) sheds whole-ass tumbleweeds of fur that collect along the edges and vacuuming them up multiple times a week is a pain. 

Do roborock vacuums do well with corners/edges at all given their round design? Does the S4 or S5 max do better?

Any other input is also much appreciated! I have 100% vinyl flooring with fake wood texture, no carpet. \~650 sq ft."
"Thinking I want an S5 Max for my birthday...Hi!  

New to the forum, and robo anything in general, and just looking for some opinions.   

I live alone with no pets in a one floor 2br/2ba condo of only about 1100sqft.  I have mostly laminate wood floors in the kitchen, living, and dining rooms with several area rugs, and I would say medium thick carpet in the bedrooms.  

Most of my damage seems to be in the kitchen area, and I'd like to have a robotic combo mop clean that area every other day maybe, every day perhaps if that doesn't present too much wear and tear.  The vacuuming of the bedrooms would probably only be once a week at most.  Mopping of the bathroom would also be about once per week.  

As the subject says, I'm leaning towards the S5 Max.  The reviews have been terrific, and it seems the best combo mop / vacuum available today.  I know that I could wait a couple of months for the S6 MaxV, but I'm not sure how necessary the front camera avoidance functionality is in my situation.  I do have quite a wire mess behind the living room television, so I was think the S5 Max's no zone mapping would be a better fit in having it stay away from that area all together.

I suppose my question is: since mopping is probably 75% of the functionality I am interested in, am I a fool to not go with a dedicated mop instead of a combo, or have you all been impressed with the way the S5 Max vacuums up normal kitchen dirt, and then mops over it well enough?  

Also, I know the mop doesn't use detergent, and I have a steam cleaner that also uses only water, and it seems to clean well enough, so can I expect a similar type of performance with this?  

Thanks in advance for your input.  I'm open to suggestions!"
"Tried the Roborock S4 and the S6I started with the S4 because I didn't need mopping functionality and it was cheaper.  However, my home has a threshold that it couldn't get over ([https://imgur.com/WMM4gzP](https://imgur.com/WMM4gzP)), so I ended up returning the S4 and purchasing a S6, which has better climbing ability.

The S6 climbs my threshold without any issues. However, there were some unexpected negatives. It's so good at climbing that it tries to climb things like sandals and my Ikea Poang chair ([https://imgur.com/XIVZr36](https://imgur.com/XIVZr36)), whereas the S4 would have bumped into it and given up. Compared to the S4, the S6's cliff sensor is more sensitive to the black stripes on my carpet ([https://imgur.com/ygCStwO](https://imgur.com/ygCStwO)). The S4 would get confused by the black stripes, but would eventually vacuum through the low pile carpet. The S6 got stuck and couldn't finish cleaning. 

Parting thoughts:

* Better climbing ability is not necessarily a good thing. I don't want my robot vacuum getting stuck trying to climb over things it shouldn't.
* Black carpets and robot vacuums don't mix. I have stairs, so I can't tape the cliff sensor. It's interesting that the S6 performs worse on black carpet than the S4.
* Robovac-proofing my home is a lot of work. I live in a smallish space in a high cost of living city, so I'm wondering if I'd be better off with a cordless stick vacuum."
"modifying S4 to handle medium plush carpet?So I guess everyone knows the S4 gets stuck on anything that isn't very thin carpet/rug.

However, I saw some comments under some of the Youtube videos of the S4 on carpet:

>I have the S4. If you get the old style brush roll for it, it performs MUCH better on carpet. I'm surprised Roborock doesn't know this yet because it would be a great idea to sell them with the old style brush roller already installed in them. It's not a problem with the vacuum, it's because the new style brush roll is too dense and has too many bristles to push through thicker carpets.

&#x200B;

>My main problem was that it was having issues keeping the brushroll running while it was running along carpet so what I did was bought an S5 brushroll for a few dollars and I haven't really had any issues since

Has anyone tried either of these methods? Where can we buy the ""old style brush roll""? Are there any disadvantages to that?

My parents have a 2 story house that is all carpet upstairs w/ tile bathrooms, but downstairs is mostly wood with some very thin rugs.

I would prefer not to have to buy the S5 MAX just for the carpet..."
"Your opinion on firmware updates?With this post I would like to ask your opinion about the FW updates on the Roborock S6.  
There have been mixed signals of firmware updates causing problems with room names, closed doors, network connectivity (S6 complaints). 

I personally own a S6 since release date and have not updated the S6 since. I do not have any complaints but I do wonder if the S6 got better over time in the sense of performance (suction/mapping) or features?

Curious on your opinions and if you could answer my question based on your experience.

I.e. for the S5 I saw they added room naming and dividing, that is a big feature upgrade on the S5."
"S4 Max in the UKHi everyone,  


After looking through the various models, it seems that the S4 Max is the best one for me (no need for mop but want good performance and mapping/room-by-room cleaning/no-go zones). However, I had no luck at all finding any sign of it on a UK website. Am I missing something? Is there any workaround if it is not available in the UK?  


Thanks"
"S5 mopping questionhey guys- i have had my s5 for a bit over a month now and just love this thing! i am so impressed with its features and performance, but so far have only vacuumed my house. thankfully my house is all hardwood floors so it is amazing to see the results even on hardwood after 1-2 s5 vacuums. the place looks so good now! my house also has a confusing layout, yet the s5 has found a great way to map it and always does a great job.

i was thinking of trying the mop this week, but figured i would ask you guys about any tips or tricks before hand. i might even try to mop just one room at a time to start off.

as an aside, my house was built in the 50s and has very old/very beautiful hardwood floors- while i know they are rugged, i also was a bit hesitant towards putting water on them with this.  i have no carpeting, so mopping will be more straight forward for me. so i was wondering, is there any issues with using water on these older hardwood floors? 

in the past i had used a swiffer wet jet to clean my wood floors with a solution designed ""for"" wood floors which always left them looking and smelling amazing, so i was curious about mopping with just water, and how well it may or may not work.

but on that note, can you add any solution to the s5 mop? or have you all found that water works way too good to bother messing with anything else?

&#x200B;

i  really appreciate any tips you guys may have in advance! thanks!"
"S4 on CarpetHi all,

I've been researching the Roborock S4 and I wanted to ask the community about it's carpet performance. I've seen some reviews that say it only works well on low profile carpet. I plan to use it 90 percent of the time on my second floor, which is all wood. The other 10 percent (maybe once a week) will be on a third floor which is all, I would call it, medium(?) profile carpet?

Does it still work well on normal house carpet? Will it constantly get stuck? Will it help if I turn the suction down? How does it compare to the mid-range Roombas? Thanks in advance!"
"Main brush silicone tearYesterday our Roborock S5 arrived. And of course I had to try it. Because the Roborock can reach spaces a normal vacuum cannot it found a tampon of my wife, which are quite hard. The tampon was stuck in the main brush and made a tear in the rubber/silicon of the main brush. Now I am wondering, is this bad? Is this normal or did we just have bad luck? Does this affect performance in any way (seeming as there are already intended gaps between the rubber/silicon, maybe a tear does not affect anything?) Should I replace the main brush now that it has a tear in the rubber/silicon?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your answers from a concerned first time user."
"Roborock S5 Max test: minimum clearance under furnitureHi guys! I've performed a test with the Roborock S5 Max to find out the minimum clearance between the floor and furniture the robot can go under. As mentioned in [this post](https://forum.roborock.com/discussion/1847/cleaning-under-couch), Roborock changed algorithms in the latest firmware to prevent the robot from getting stuck under furniture.

Here is the video: [https://youtu.be/elaWrMgy83s](https://youtu.be/elaWrMgy83s)

I installed a cardboard box to make a gap 10.4 - 11 cm between the floor and the box and the S5 Max was able to fit under it without any problems. Seems like 10.4 cm is the minimum clearance suitable for the S5 Max. By the way, Lidar was able to detect the box considering it showed up on the map."
"Factory Reset doesn’t fully resetHow do you get roborock to FULLY factory reset? When I factory reset, 90% of the time the firmware does not revert back to factory. Neither does Time Zone or DND once app and robot are reinstalled. 

I’ve been having to factory reset every couple weeks because mapping and navigation get so bad. Waiting another paycheck and then I can exchange for newer model (S5max hopefully). My cliff notes factory reset process: unplug router, delete MiHome robot history, delete robot from app, delete cache, sign out & delete app, turn off iPhone/Mac/iwatch, reset WiFi on robot, then perform factory reset. The reset process runs for ~5 minutes, during which I do NOT power on any of smart devices mentioned above that do or have connected to the roborock. Router remains off as well. 

Once completed I go through full installation only to discover it didn’t truly complete a full factory reset. Almost like a soft reset if that was an option, however it’s my understanding it is not. Only 2-3 times have I been successful with the reset but I cannot pinpoint how. I’ll unplug dock, pull dustbin out, factory reset again by interrupting current reset, etc. 

Someone help!!"
"S6 on bright floors?Hello,

I have a question regarding Roborock S6. ( I have tried to find people with similar problem but didn't have much luck); I'm considering purchasing S6 as it's really good value + does both mopping and vaccuming, but in the description of the product it does say that it might have trouble with really bright/white flooring. My house consists mostly of hardwood and cream/white tiles (mostly matt), and I'm a bit concerned if that's not going to create an issue and maybe I should go for Braava M6. Therefore my question:

&#x200B;

**Is Roborock S6 performing well while cleaning bright/white tiles or hardwood?**

"Are Roborock and Xiaomi the same company?Many of us are probably confused about some robot models and do not know which one is produced by Xiaomi or Roborock company.

As far as I know, Xiaomi is an investor and strategic partner of Roborock. The first robot vacuum produced by Roborock, the Xiaomi Mi Robot, was released under the Xiaomi brand. But after that Roborock started producing robots under its own brand. Roborock still helps Xiaomi to develop vacuum cleaners but the company has nothing to do with customer support of Xiaomi products.

So which robot models are Xiaomi and which ones are Roborock?

Xiaomi has 4 robot vacuums:

* **Xiaomi Mi Robot** (maybe the best-selling and most-known Xiaomi robot)
* **Xiaomi MiJia 1S** (one of the newest robots that has a Lidar and also visual sensor to navigate around)
* **Xiaomi MiJia STYJ02YM** (a high-end model that can mop and sweep)
* **Xiaomi MiJia 1C** (a budget model that also can sweep and mop but has no Lidar).

Roborock has launched 6 models:

* **Roborock Xiaowa Series** that includes **E25/E35**(same model, different colors) and **E35**. These are Gyroscope-guided robots that can mop and sweep, have decent suction power and long battery life. Actually one of the best in its price range.
* **Roborock S5/S55/S51/S50**, which is the same model but with different color options. The Roborock S50 is white, S51 - rose-gold, S55 - black. (the best-selling model, everyone probably heard about it)
* **Roborock S6** (its high-end robot vacuum that is the quietest in the model line, supports no-go lines, zoned cleaning, and room cleaning)
* **Roborock S4** (has the same features as the S6 but lacks mopping and has reduced climbing ability of 15 mm/0.6 in instead of 20 mm/0.8in )
* **Roborock S5 Max** (the latest robot vacuum with the most mopping features such as a bigger water container, no-mop zones, scheduling for mopping, etc.)

If you dive deeper, you will see that there are many differences between the two companies. From my experience, Roborock has great customer support so if you have any related questions, you can get a response shortly after contacting them via email. Also, all Roborock models are available to buy on Amazon while you can only get the Xiaomi Mi Robot there, other models, for now, are on sale on Gearbest or Aliexpress.

P. S. Hope this post made it a bit clearer for you to understand the difference between the companies."
"roborock s5 max mapping problemBought recently roborock s5 max. Overall satisfied with its performance. The problem I notice is that the map generated after a full run and later customised (for different rooms) which got loaded properly on the second day vanished after I used the cleaner in an un mapped, partitioned balcony area. I am not seeing any back up map of the original one. Is there any solution to recover ? appreciate help."
"Relocated both the S4 and the i7+The Roomba i7 undocks and docks without issue. The S4 tries to drive over its base and then starts humping the baseboard next to the base before getting the wheels elevated and sending me an alert to rescue it.

Once I set it down a foot or so away from where it's stuck, I resume cleaning and it then performs admirably and docks when done without issue.

But the start has been rocky every time since I relocated it. This kind of surprises me since the LIDAR navigation generally is superior to the contrast camera of the Roomba. And yet, here we are."

"Does anyone know if the S6 MaxV is more powerful than the S5 Max?Deciding between the S5 and S6 MaxV. 

I have seen several reviews stating that the S6 MaxV (even though advertised to be more powerful 2500pa vs 2000pa) is less powerful in reality with overall including worse performance on rugs and less cubic feet per minute. 

Vaccum wars on YouTube who I use for reviews has not yet posted. Was hoping there are some vaccum geeks on here like me that could help me out! 

Here is the review I am referring to that says the S5 is more powerful. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0uAri6flfI0

Main factor for me is power as it is a vaccum. I have 2 dogs who shed quite a bit. Currently using a Neato D7 that I am selling to my parents as I want a combo vaccum and mop."

"Only Notify Me When There's a ProblemI have now had my Roborock for several months and it has performed flawlessly and consistently. So much so that I no longer want to be notified when a scheduled cleaning starts and stops. However, I would still like to be notified if an issue occurs.

"Firmware updateHi, had my S6 for one week now and so far its looking really good. A bit struggle with the Xiaomi Home app until I was able to divide the map into all the rooms of my house. I don’t want to do that again, so here’s my question: I got a push notification about a new firmware today, do you loose the map if you perform a firmware upgrade?"
"Roborock S5 won't connectWe received our new Roborock S5 today, but it does not want to connect. I'm using the Mi Home app. If I try to set up the device:

* The scan finds the device (either on the homescreen, or after selecting the Roborock S5 specifically)
* I get a checkmark at 'Device connected' (quite quickly)
* I get a red X at 'Failed to send message', after 'Sending message to device...'
* I can only press 'try again', or stop adding the device at this point.

I've also [made screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/oHVQtyH) of what I'm seeing in the app.

The Roborock itself has a glowing power light, and the WiFi indicator is blinking.

What I've tried so far:

* Ensure the region is set to my own country (Netherlands)
* Perform a soft reset (the reset button behind the cover)
* Perform a WiFi reset (hold the charge and spot clean buttons for 3 seconds)
* Perform a factory reset (charge button for 3 seconds, press reset button once, hold charge button until it resets)
* Reinstall the Mi Home app
* Use a different WiFi network. Both networks tried are 2.4ghz, second one has a 12-letter password with only latin letters, as I read somewhere on here that it might be caused by a complex password.
* Make sure the WiFi network has a WPA key (password)
* Place my phone closer to the device (I've held it on all sides, at a few meters, or just put it on top of the Roborock)
* Have the Roborock run for a bit and return to charging station.

It does seem like this is a device that has been returned to the seller before (as various parts are dirty, most notably the mop attachment), and we're already contacted them to see if this is the case. My thoughts are that the previous buyers might have returned it for similar issues, but that is just a guess. At best, the info might help debug this issue.

"Anyone else have shipping problems with Fedex and Roborock?I had ordered my first Roborock vacuum last week and it was out for delivery yesterday. It was supposed to require a signature because of the value of the robot. Well, I wasn't even home yesterday. Fedex claims I signed for it. They didn't even spell my name right either. And of course, when I did get back to my apartment there is no box out for me. I contacted Roborock and they're having me deal with Fedex... After a mildly rude customer service agent. Is this type of customer service the norm for this company?

Anyone else deal with this? I don't understand why:

A) Fedex didn't respect the fact Roborock paid extra to require a direct signature

B) If they were going to lie about me signing, why didn't they just leave it in the package lockers at my apartment?"

"Roborock S7+ Firmware SuggestionsSo this is mainly directed at anyone in the Roborock software engineering department that cares for a little constructive feedback. I was a Roborock S7+ and Auto Empty Bin early adopter for both products, without a doubt the construction of both is the highest quality and I have been nothing but completely happy with both products up to the this point. However over the past 5-ish months, the firmware updates have really deteriorated my experience. The robot is consistently having navigation issues, finding areas of the home that just don’t exist, and at times now just gets lost and I have to pick it up as it sadly wanders around my home. I've done a re-map twice already at this point. None of these issues existed on the earlier version of the firmware. So I’m going to up front what I think the issue is, I really believe the firmware and cleaning algorithms have just been way over engineered. As an Electrical Engineer who does design work as well as Systems Engineer who is a manager, I understand the impulse to iterate on your product to fully envelope all your edge cases and to provide a product that provides 99.9999% coverage for your customer. At some point you reach a point of diminishing return and in this instance, I would argue provide a WORSE customer experience. The robot vacuum should provide a 95% cleaning solution for your customers, it will never fit into those odd little corners or get the dirt out of every crevice, and while I appreciate the engineering team trying, its really throwing my robot for a loop. In evidence of this, the first picture I uploaded was a custom zone cleanup, in the past I’ve done this exact zone before and the robot has done great, done in less than 10 minutes with minimal battery usage. However consistently now when we specify this cleaning zone, the robot obsesses over getting into the corner where my TV stand connects with the wall. In the picture you can see the robot going all the way around my house 2-3 time trying to get itself into that corner. It also obsesses over the chair in the northern part of the image, trying many many times to get all the way around the legs. This tiny zone cleaning took 20min to complete and used 16% of the battery, that is a huge change from earlier version of the firmware. In the second picture I uploaded, I had specified a room cleanup for the area I have specified as the “dining room,” the robot just left the cleaning area inexplicably and just stopped, had to pick it up and drop it back at the base station. So anyways, I’ll wrap this up, on the one hand I completely respect the Roborock engineering teams commitment to continuing to hone and develop their firmware/algorithms. But just asking you, take a step back, and make sure the positive changes you are trying to make are not having unintended negative impacts on your customers experience.

-  Good Mopping capabilities with electric water control
-  Mapping function with Real Time Tracking, Zoned Cleaning, No-Mop Zones & Multi Floor maps etc
-  Object recognition/AI Camera would be nice but is not a must

Here in Malaysia, Roborock S6 MaxV can be bought at $482 while Roborock S5 Max & Xiaomi Mijia 1C are priced at $393 &  $204 respectively. Considering the prices, is worth it to go for S6 MaxV (retailed at $750) or perhaps S5 Max (retailed at $480) as its good enough for my usage? Or should I just settle for the budget model (Mijia 1C - retailed at $269) which imo gives the best bang for the bucks?

"Why to buy S6 if S5 max has more features and is cheaper?Have i miss understood someting or does S5 just have more features and cheaper price? One would assume the S6 is flagship but as long as it does not have separate mop cycles that can be programmed with no mop zones for me it seems it just has less features.

I truely hope S6 will get the no mop zone besides normal no go zones feature  in the software! I get that hardware you cannot really upgrade but this would help so when you attach the mop you could tell in the app to respect no mop zones and times without mop ignore them."
"Second dock/base upstairs for S6?Whaddup, robot vacuum lovers!

I live in a two level home and would like my S6 to occasionally vacuum upstairs. Getting a second S6 seems like overkill (and a waste of money) and I really don't mind just bringing it upstairs once a week. According to the Roborock app, for the mapping to work on two levels you should bring the dock up as well. But my dock is plugged in under a cabinet, with the wires neatly tucked away, so unplugging it every time is a bit of a hassle (first world problems, I know). So I was wondering if I could perhaps buy a second dock for upstairs.

I searched and found two posts in this subreddit, but they had an S4 ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/eh8ekx/extra_dock_for_s4/)) and an S5 ([link](https://old.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/edqq02/charging_base_for_s5_max/)), respectively. So I figured I'd ask for the S6 specifically.

Does anybody here own an S6 with 2 docks on different levels? Does it work like I hope it does? And where (in the US) did you get your second dock? It seems only the [S4 dock is available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-Robot-Vacuum-Dock-Charger/dp/B07CNP7YDW). And while Alibaba has a bunch of docks (like [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4000048875216.html)), I would rather get an official one.

I've emailed Roborock support, will report back here if I get an answer, but it would be nice to get some hands on experience from the community. :)

Thanks!"
"Used S7 MAX VHello! I'm looking to buy a used robot vacuum cleaner. I leave on a quite big 1 bedroom apartment with only 2 thin carpets but a lot of cables, and the floor gets really messy (I have people over really often). I decided on getting a Roborock S7 MaxV, as I want something that would put me through as little struggle as possible. I know it's a really expensive for a 1 bedroom apartment but I've been saving some money and I want to get the best thing. But I would want to buy it second hand, not only to save money but also for some other reasons of principle. What should I pay attention to? Some of the ads say how many hours the robot has been used but I don't if the number is alright. Also, are there fake robot vacuums and if there are how can I spot one? I found a Roborock S7 Max V second hand for 400 euro/440, is that ok?"
"Roborock S7 rooting/Valetudo tutorialHello,

there is little information on using Valetudo on the S7, so I am writing this tutorial. The main Valetudo dev does **not** recommend or officially support this device, so do not expect help or bother him with problems related to the S7!

**Update:** This has changed, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/v5zth2/problems_rooting_roborock_s7/j67lthu/?context=1)

**If you are not technically inclined, this is not for you**. But I have tested it and need to share this information - out of principle.

**Q/A**

* *What is this / Why would I do this?* -> Rooting means attaining full access to a device's operating system. It should be a matter of course the device's owner should have this, but IoT companies are anti-consumer. After rooting, [Valetudo](https://valetudo.cloud/) may be installed. It provides an interface similar to the official app, but constrained to the local network (or internet via VPN). The vacuum is now liberated from the internet/cloud, not sharing any (potentially sensitive) data with China and not requiring an account. Control or schedules will not break anymore when the cloud is down/blocked/hacked/discontinued/out of business/starts demanding a subscription/etc. Valetudo also enables integration with many home automation systems and allows custom voice packs. Lastly, it can be controlled with any device featuring a modern browser, not just phones.

* *Will the vacuum behave differently or navigate badly?* -> Nope. Valetudo replaces the ""cloud"" component, not the firmware on the device itself. It behaves as before.

* *Do I have to set everything up again?* -> Nope. Only schedules aka timers. The map is stored on the device and will still be the same after converting to Valetudo.

* *Can it be undone?* -> Yes. Install a firmware without the ""Patch DNS"" flag set.

* *How well does it work?* -> Great, in my experience! Contrary to [statements from Valetudo's main dev](https://erppc.net/~haarp/temp/Valetudo_Discussion_854.html), everything works. Plenty of RAM (>1/4) is left while Valetudo is running. ROM is near full, but that's no concern to an user. Some things are not (yet) configurable, but will still work: Carpet ignore zones, carpet handling with mop attached (raise mop/avoid/ignore) and showing carpets or mopping path on the map. Everything else is splendid. I have not, however, tested the auto-empty dock.

* *How much effort is it / will I succeed?* -> It's risky. You'll void the warranty. The robot needs to be disassembled down to the main board and a temporary wire needs to be added to flash a modified firmware. This is a lot of effort and can potentially damage the bot. Only recommended for those with experience tinkering with electronic devices and basic Linux/command line skills.  
It's also possible that [newer firmwares prevent rooting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/v5zth2/problems_rooting_roborock_s7/ibd0cac/), so beware. This is not yet fully confirmed tho. I can only confirm that firmware 02.14.44 was rootable. If someone attempts it on a newer firmware (such as the current 02.15.00), please report back. For the time being, avoid updating the firmware if you intend to root at any point. **Update**: See /u/dontvacuumme comment below

* *I want a fully-featured modern vacuum that's easier to root!* -> Get a Dreame L/Z10 (Pro) (but avoid updating the firmware on these too!). Also see [here](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html). For me, the reason for going with the S7 was the vibrating/rising mop.

* *What about the S7 MaxV?* -> Not a chance. There is no known rooting method and there likely never will be. The S7 non-MaxV may be the last Roborock bot to be rootable by mortal means. Luckily, second-hand devices and spare parts should continue to be available for a long time.


**Tutorial**

/u/dontvacuumme was the brilliant mind who came came up with the FEL rooting method. His howto can be found [here](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/howtos/nand/fel/_howto.html). A visual guide for disassembling the S7 is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGScpICKEbE).

I have a few comments, in *addition* to the howto above:

* I recommend fully charging the battery and setting the robot up with the official app first, so it connects to your Wi-Fi and you can note down its IP address. This is not strictly necessary however. Do **NOT** update the firmware!
* Be careful and gentle. If you need force, you're likely doing something wrong.
* There is a thin steel wire on the side holding the mop plate. It becomes visible once you start separating the main shell. Use tweezers to remove the small nipple at the end of this wire from its plastic housing before fully removing the shell.
* The vacuum needs to be disassembled down to the main board. The board can be removed from the robot, as it will still boot/connect to Wi-Fi with only the battery (and the little daughterboard) attached.
* See [here](https://i.imgur.com/j60PgGD.png) for the location of the pads that need to be shorted. They're on the underside of the board.
* The board has a conformal coating on it. Scrape it off (or solder) on both pads to make sure the wire actually makes electrical contact.
* If using Linux: Some distro's sunxi-tools packages install the `fel` command instead of `sunxi-fel`. Edit run.sh to remedy this.
* *""After it has been uploaded, wait 5 minutes. Your robot should restart when its done (look for turned off leds)""* <- also applies to Linux!
* *""Your robot should be reachable via SSH and your SSH key.""* <- the username is `root` (big surprise there).
* *""Continue the steps to install Valetudo (check the steps at the bottom of this document: S5E Cheatsheet)""* <- only the stuff after *""# this step activates valetudo""* is relevant.
* After these steps, navigate a browser towards the IP address of the robot to see the Valetudo interface.

Hope this helps somebody! Let me know if you have questions."
"Safe cleaning fluid for Roborock moppingI have been seeing a few posts recently on using some type of cleaning fluid in the mopping tank. I posted this recommendation in a response to another post but figured it could use its own post. 

I have been using the iRobot Braava Jet cleaning solution in my S5 Max and now S6 MaxV continuously since the S5 Max was released with zero ill effects. I felt that this solution was designed and tested for a similar environment as the Roborock Max system (the older drip style mops like the S5 may have different results). 

My primary concern with any solution long term was gumming/oxidation and corrosion. Both of these issues likely would of been tested for by iRobot for use in their Braava Jets. The use case is very similar, different materials and components obviously but same basic principle. It smells nice, works relatively well and appears to have some kind of drying aid. I felt the risk of damage was way lower vs using something like Bona or Mirage floor cleaner. 

4 capfuls per Roborock Max water tank is roughly the same concentration that iRobot recommends in their tanks."
"Box dimensions and weight of Roborock S4 Max/S6 Pure.I finally decided to get a robot vacuum and settled for a Roborock. I'm still deciding between a S4 Max and a S6 Pure, I'm waiting to see if they drop in price during Prime Day (any feedback on those models would be appreciated).

For the title, I want to know if any kindhearted soul that owns any of those models could measure the box they come in when brand new and an approximate weight. I need this info because I have to import the vacuum and my shipping company charges me based on item weight/Volume.

My sincere thanks to anyone that helps me with my request."

Thanks for your interest in Roborock.

Sorry S4 is still on hold on our official store right now, and we are sorry that we didn't receive the schedule about when it will be launched on UK market.
By the way, the S4 is not designed to work carpet, on hard floor, all is fine.

"Tight Q5 brush on S7 MaxV update - genuine works!So after my recent post/video regarding the tight fit of the Q5 brush on my S7 MaxV, after some helpful comments asking if it was a genuine brush or not (it wasn't genuine), I went ahead and ordered what I hoped was a genuine Q5 brush on AliExpress.

I received the brush today that came in an official looking box (compared to the blank box the other one came in) and I tested it out.

It fits way better! No issues at all, and I'm loving what seems to be better pickup of pet hair and lint from my carpets.

The video shows how the brush fits and spins just fine compared to what you can see in my other video, and also the only real difference I can tell from the non genuine one; the little end bearing is removable. (There is also a very slight colour difference, and the bristles feel softer on the genuine brush)

Here is a link to some pictures of the box and the brushes side by side: https://imgur.com/gallery/XuFofxZ"
"Where to buy a genuine water tank for Roborock S5?My Roborock S5 functioned flawlessly for two years (over 100 cleaning cycles) until the water tank developed a crack and began to leak.

"Genuine Roborock S5 max mop pad colour and style?Hi All!

UPDATE: The new mopping pads that I bought in the official box from a proper store worked terrifically well, despite looking a lot like the terrible cheap ones I had bought online earlier. They're beige and brown. Will see how well they hold up in the washing machine on hand wash setting! 

Original post: Love my S5 Max, and for my (pretty clean) house, I find the mopping feature quite useful.

When I bought the machine around two years ago, it came with one fantastic grey, full-coverage mopping pad (not the older style ones with just the thicker material in the middle part) that has held up really well (over two years!) even with many machine-washes. It catches the dirt really consistently across it and is even. Edit: the ""good"" one that came with my machine looks like these ones: [https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-Robotic-Microfiber-Mopping-Generation/dp/B07BRH2TN7](https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-Robotic-Microfiber-Mopping-Generation/dp/B07BRH2TN7).

I wanted to have a couple of extras, so I bought some replacement pads from a store in Sweden not that long ago, and they looked completely different. More of a beige fabric with brown plastic around the upper edge. And they were terrible, and the quality in the stitching/material etc was super visible. When using them, the dirt only became visible around the edges, and after a couple of (hand!) washes, the plastic tubing fell out of the top bit you attach it with, and I had to throw them out. After looking online, it seemed like maybe the grey ones (like my original) were the real ones, and all the cheap fake poor quality ones were that beige/brown combo. The beige ones look like this:

Anyway, flash forward to today, and I found replacement mopping cloths in the proper Roborock box in a big, reputable electronics store. When I got them home and opened the box, they look exactly the same as the cheap nasty ones that fell apart after a couple of uses. Beige, poor stitching, different configuration, etc etc. The bad beige ones look more like this: [https://www.amazon.com/Microfiber-Compatible-Roborock-Washable-Replacement/dp/B09BJ9Q1VY/ref=sr\_1\_6?crid=FN9H1KSLVE89&keywords=roborock+s5+mop+pad&qid=1660409096&sprefix=roborock+s5+mop+p%2Caps%2C450&sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/Microfiber-Compatible-Roborock-Washable-Replacement/dp/B09BJ9Q1VY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=FN9H1KSLVE89&keywords=roborock+s5+mop+pad&qid=1660409096&sprefix=roborock+s5+mop+p%2Caps%2C450&sr=8-6)

So I wanted to ask - should the real Roborock-endorsed mopping pads be that original grey material, with the better quality? Or is Roborock now selling the beige/brown, poorer quality ones themselves? I also thought it might be possible that someone bought the real ones in the store, swapped them for some crappy online ones, and then returned them and the store didn't realize.

I really love my original mopping pad, and I'd love to track another down. Also didn't want to start to use these ones that I paid way more for if they're just the cheap fake ones!

Thanks so much for the help!"

"Reliable website to buy front wheel replacement for S7 maxVI recently bought a used S7 maxV for $450. I usually never buy used so there was the risk of something not being right. 

This weekend I got it, and out of everything the only thing broken was the front multidirectional wheel broken in half from the bracket(that contains two screws).

Temporary solution is literally putting the wheel in its place and letting gravity keep it there (so far it has only come off once).

Realistically I need to find a website that sells the wheel with a bracket. Unfortunately roborock doesn't sell it on their website.

So I wanted to ask if anyone also had to replace it with the bracket, and where did you buy it from (with link if possible).

-Thank you."
What’s the point of dustbin emptying without mop cleaning?This may seem like a stupid question - but it’s a genuine one! I can see the 2 extremes - get a cheaper device where you empty the bin and dry/clean/refill the mop yourself vs have it all entirely automated. But why have the in between version? Ie why pay have the dustbin emptied automatically if you still have to do the mop maintenance yourself? Surely empty the bin isn’t much more to do if you’re remembering to sort out the mop already?

"Availability of S7 MaxV Ultra parts & accessories (Belgium/Europe)Hello,

I'm in the market of buying my very first robot vacuum. I'll most likely go straight for the top of the line (either Ecovacs X1 Omni or Roborock S7MVU) but I'm a bit worried about the availability of spare parts and accessoires like dust bags and brushes, especially here in Belgium (practically non-existent) and by further extent Europe.

From my research it seems like the only two major stores to have those are either Amazon or AliExpress. Weirdly enough, I can't find any retailers in Belgium or the Netherlands that carry extra parts, they only sell the complete units. Does Roborock have an official store on AliExpress? I'm that type of person that prefers to buy genuine parts instead of non-original parts.

Additionally, how frequent would one have to replace certain parts? For example the mopping pads, I assume you can also machine wash them from time to time? 

Lastly, yes I know the S8's are on the way, but from what I've read those might retail for even higher prices (cheapest S7MVU I can find right now is around €1230) and compared to the S7 MaxV performance is somewhat similar. Additionally I would try to get the Hot Air Dryer module to make the package complete. Note also that I only have one carpet (at the TV area) and the rest is hardfloor, I also don't have any pets.

Apologies for the rather lengthy post, but I want to clear up those points because spending so much money."
"Genuine Accessories for Australia?Hi just wondering if anyone knows an AliExpress store that sells genuine Accessories and ships to Australia?

"Where to buy genuine Roborock S5 washable filters for the UK?I have the Xiaomi Mi robot vacuum (1st gen) which does not come with washable filters but I understand the S5 comes with washable filters and that these are interchangeable with the Xiaomi.

"My way to keep the watertank filters workingI have Roborock E5 and I have kinda struggled with the tiny foamy watertank filters that slowly let water through onto the mop, they were becoming clogged quite quickly and not letting water through. I think it is caused by hard water and everytime the water dries out, the mineral+fine dirt left in the foam slowly clog it, because after just 10-20 hours of mopping, the filters let no water through.

These things helped me to restore the water flow onto the mop to keep it wet during mopping:

1) Dont let the filters dry out. Take out the water tank after cleaning is done, remove the filters and put them into a shot glass with distilled water and keep them there until next cleaning. This way the minerals from tap water never get the chance to clog the filter.

2) Let air into the watertank during mopping. Fill the tank only 50-70% full with water and dont completely close the water intake and let it breathe a little. If the air can freely go into the water tank, no negative pressure can build up and the water flows through the filter much freely. If you dont mind voiding waranty, you can drill a small hole in the top middle part of the watertank to let the air permanently in.

3) Puncture the filters with a thick sewing needle, which will create a small opening to let water through better.

I like to have the mop more wet during mopping, and the default setup wasnt letting much water through, so the mop remained somewhat wet only right around the filters during mopping, plus the clogging was slowly cutting down the waterflow further. But with these tricks I have improved the water flow significantly."

"Genuinely astonished at the amount of dust my S5 max collectsI live in a reasonably sized 1 bed flat in London. Bought an S5 Max last month and am constantly astonished at just how much dust and dirt it collects.

It's making such a difference, the air feels cleaner, furniture is less dusty, and my husband and I no longer argue over who's turn it is to clean.

However, its estimated arrival is late February. Thus, I looked on Amazon and eBay to find one but the review was not attractive -- either not charging or the battery dies in a year.

Is there an online store that has a genuine battery? It was a shock that they don't sell their replacement batteries on their website.

"Roborock s7 watertank issues 💧💦Making this post twice, apologies for wall of text but I'm pretty desperate for help: 

Hello.

Having to create a new account to hopefully get some help from you knowledgeable fellows.

I had until recently been very happy with my Roborock s7.

I then discovered that the water tank was leaking and had developed cracks. Thinking I had possibly banged it... I bought another one. 1 month later the same cracks in the same spots that gradually get worse. Buy another tank and think I should be careful and run it and keep an eye. Less than 10 runs in and more cracks. Same places that get worse with every run. They look like stress fractures as well and slowly develop all over.

I have contacted Roborock for advice or guidance to no avail and I dont want to buy another to keep spending 16 euros a month on new water tanks.

To clarify: 1) latest tank definitely wasn't banged, nudged or dropped. 2) The last tank had nothing but plain water inside of it. 3) The first cracks are always around the port for the robot nozzle that feeds water to the drip feature. 4) The water tanks were all genuine roborock tanks. 5) I have a grated area in my flat that I think might be an issue, but I am unsure if it's the climbing of carpet to floor or something else that could cause this. And event then.... these cracks look extreme for that.

Happy to provide pictures if people feel they need clarification, but perhaps someone already has the same experience or an idea. Looking around I seem to have a unique issue.

Thank you in advance."

As soon the pairing is done I can control it just fine with my Google Mini speaker, but after approximately a week, when I try to control it it tells me the Roborock is not reachable.

The only solution I found is to go to the Google Assistant app, find the Roborock integration, and press on ""Check for new devices"", at that point it asks me to login again into the Roborock login page and the Roborock is reachable again from Google Assistant.

It seems like the authentication token is expiring and the Google Assistant app is not able to refresh it with a refresh token.

Do you guys have a solution to this?"
"An app update us available.LOL, IS available not us available..love self correction. 

Hopefully it will fix my connection problems when the vac is sitting in the same room as the router.

4. Reduced a problem causing slow connections in some situations
5. Bugs squashed."
"What are the chances they ad the security camera feature back?I don’t get why they would give up a manual controller for the S8 pro ultra without having a camera feed. Worried about security? Secure your networks for one and two your not that special 😂 

Jokes aside the camera is a nice security tool as if you can view the camera as a way to check the house if you think a break in has happens it great and the only reason I can see why the S7 would be better than the S8 but the S8 at least in my opinion is the better product

I’m hoping they add it via programming and maybe make it a toggle that can be flipped on or off after a password"

"Just upgraded from S50 to S7 Maxv Ultra. Great decision.The difference is night and day in every aspect.

After using S50 for nearly 4 years it served me well. Also, 6 months ago I changed the battery. 

S50 was trying to reach every point, it never avoided anything which is lower than the lidar sensor, which became frustrating. The main reason for me to upgrade to S7 maxv was the new sensors and the camera. And they are working way better than expected.

So, long story short, whoever is in between upgrading from S5, S50, or S5 Max, just don't think about it, and do the upgrade. 

S8 Pro Ultra was also an option but the missing live camera is a downgrade for me."
"First bug found with S8wifi would not connect.    My password has a $$ on the end, only setting up a new SSID without that allowed it to connect.   I ran into this once before 10 years ago with an Anker security camera that also refused to work with a $ in the wifi password.

Once it charges, I'll do the available firmware upgrade and try that again.

edit:   even after the firmware update, it still won't connect to the that wifi.

edit2:   **turns out it's not the password**, it's the DTIM interval.  I had it set to 3.  When I created a new SSID it defaults to 1.     So I just changed that new SSID to 3 and boom the roborock disconnects.   Change it back to 1 and it's back on.  It doesn't like a DTIM of 2 either.

edit3:   further testing, it's both the password AND the DTIM that I was stymied by"

"After 8 Months of Heavy Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra Usage with 2 Cattle Dogs...I figured I would start with the roller. Maybe only upgrade the roller with a hair brush one instead of the factory rubber unit. Surely it would be smart to  replace the HEPA filter, maybe the little spinning part..why not wipe away the dust a bit too?

Surely not too much.

Hey, that mop pad is looking rough, let's put a new one on.

What the?.. why is all this hair hidden here?...

..and here.

...

...and here?

.. how far does this go?!

...surely removing this security screw wouldn't void the warranty, now would it?

..yeah, pretty sure I just did void that... okay. Well, what's under this, let's find out.

......my god. Did I just \*save\* my unit after only 8 months of, albeit heavy, usage?

&#x200B;

I may very well have just voided my warranty, but surely I prolonged the life having taken these cleaning steps. Look how much hair, debris, and dust has been collected after just 8 months of usage! Kudos to Roborock for the repairability factor, 10/10..assuming that screw did not void my warranty.

"Battery concernI bought my S7 MaxV last month and loving it!! However, not sure if the battery is faulty as the cleaning duration varies.  We have approx 140sq meter area for full cleaning, some days the battery lasts about 145mins and does the cleaning in one go but on some days the battery only lasts for 80-90mins, goes back to charging for about 2hrs and then resumes cleaning again which is a long time finish the full clean. And the unit is always charged to 100% before starting the full clean mode.  I would imagine that the battery run time should be consistent like any other good brand vacuum. I’m following this up with the technical team as there may be a technical fault with the unit and should be either repaired or replaced as it is a brand new unit and under warranty. and I bought this directly from the website and have been asked to send the unit back for checking which I’m really concerned as I’ve to pack it myself and worried if the unit gets damaged on the way. I think there should be better service provided for repair/replacement to have a secure way to send back the unit. I’ve flagged my concerns with the team and hoping to get an outcome that is easier to do and quicker."

"Roborock communicationAs you know robot can work with extended functionality with the app, so we need to add it. Based on the Cybersecurity needs, we have to define the exact communication on the network. So for example I have to know the ports and also the communication flow.

So which device is participating in a communication, one- or two way traffic, who is the requester, etc…

"Anyone here setup roborock securely on wifi? Seems to require remote access to function and not sure I like that...Hi, posted this question in r/homenetworking already but didn't get any replies. I have roborock s7 and like the device but not comfortable with the access it requires on my network. I have roborock on my IoT WiFi (isolated network from my more secure devices like computers, NAS), the firewall rules I use on that network are preventing the roborock from being detected on my android app. But the firewall rules are there for a reason, to prevent unauthorized chatter from outside in to my network.

From what I can tell, given this thing doesn't use a bridge (like e.g. Philips Hue), it seems Roborock only works by remote access from Xiami's servers. I don't like the idea that these servers would continually enter into my home network.

Anyone else find a way to use this device with the app, but mitigate risk of having your network too open? I'm considering setting up yet another IoT wifi network and let it live there, alone, but unsure if that's inherently safer or not.

Thanks

"S6 MaxV possibility of being used for security?I'm looking at the possibility of buying meself S6 MaxV since me house is 🎄 stories tall and  I had to maintain multiple not so smart Xiaomi robots. I was initially not so keen on the camera cause I do not want me self and me family to be on watch 24/7 but now I'm thinking it would be an extra security measure if I can setup me robot to tape when I'm off. I'm sure there're some gdpr bs but is there any  workaround so that can be achieved.

TL:DR is there a way to use the robot as home security camera or any plans for that to happen?"

The security implications of having both the robot and android app connected to the internet are tremendous and the only benefit I can think of would be automatic firmware updates and anonymous usage data triggering the above-mentioned updates."

I have an S4 Max and love it. If I were to buy another right now it would be Q5, Q5+, S7 MaxV, S7 MaxV Plus, or S7 MaxV Ultra because I think there's no point in having the mop if it can't lift up out of the way when not in use. Also if I'm getting an S7, I would splurge for the obstacle avoidance. It also enables video and two-way audio, letting you use it as a little home security sentry in a pinch. I appreciate them adding the dock option to the Q5 and it's great if you can go without a mop. Otherwise, S7 MaxV at minimum. Just my two cents."

"Roborock S7 jumps off my IoT network and onto my home network without being provided the password.I have had an S7 for almost a year now. Have always been concerned about the security risk, but against my better judgement, fell for the convenience. I have a google home mesh wifi system with the guest network configured as my IoT net with separate SSID and password. The only reason the S7 needs an internet connection is because scheduled cleanings are maintained in the app/Roborock account, not stored local on the bot.  So in order for the robot to run at scheduled times, it needs to receive the “start cleaning” command from the web. To keep things as controlled as possible, I’ve implemented web restrictions through the google WiFi for the S7 all hours of the day except when it needs to receive the start cleaning command. As a result, it spends most of its time in the dock frantically trying to find a web connection. 

Here’s the rub…I will set up the S7 through the Roborock app on my phone while connected to the guest side of my network, and provide the guest SSID and password.  I will temporarily enable iOS privileges that the app requires for setup (precise location while using the app, local network access). As soon as setup is complete, I restrict both privileges. Google home shows the S7 happy on the device list under the guest WiFi.  I then pull my phone off the guest WiFi and back on to my home WiFi.  Within minutes of turning on the google home web restrictions (which switches off internet access to the S7), google home shows the S7 bouncing between the device list on my home network and my guest network (presumably searching for a good connection).  At no time have I knowingly provided my home network SSID or PW to the S7.

I’ve run this experiment multiple times with new passwords and the result is the same. Somehow, Apple appears to be leaking SSID’s and passwords to the Roborock app, and providing them to the S7 in a sneaky way.  I have no other explanation.  

If true, Roborock may have SSID’s and passwords for every network it’s customers have ever connected to…I have no idea.

Someone please give me a better explanation that will help me sleep at night."
"Anyone else notice increasingly asshole-ish behavior from their Roborock?It's hard not to personify these things. Sure, an engineer or smarter person would probably have a technical explanation, but there's really no better way to describe what's happened to my Roborock. He's just become a total dick.

In the past, he'd respond to an obstacle by navigating around it. These days, he prefers to bash his face into it. Repeatedly. Bash. Bash. Bash. 

Reasonable me knows he has no way of knowing that's the bookcase with our antique ceramics. But then how can you explain that this one bookshelf is where he goes for all his Wailing-Wall-style face smashing needs? I know malicious behavior when I see it.

I always keep cords and cables tucked securely away, usually under bookscases, furniture or other inaccessible places. In recent months he has simply redefined ""inaccessible"". Any place is accessible if you try hard enough. 

And the glory of dragging a ratsnest of cables into the center of the living room? That glory goes only to the bold. Well he's bolder than ever and these are his glory days.

I mean, just look at the way he crawled under there to pull that cord to knock that lamp into the fish tank! You can't do that by accident. Well done, buddy.


Lastly, navigation. You know the old joke that ""You can't get there from here""? My Roborock's firmware has been updated to that joke.

It has never been possible to go through the bedroom to get back to the charger. Never. The bedroom has but one door. If you enter through that door, you have no choice but to exit through that door. And you'll do so uncharged.
Every. Single. Time.

Yet lately when it's time to recharge, that's his preferred route. The dead-end route to NoChargerVille. The only reasonable explanation is that he's learned that if he wants to get his roller jammed on a sock, then the bedroom is the best place to do that. There's no other reason to go there except to choke on socks. 

LIDAR, front bumper and sensors are all clean and functioning. I've deleted maps and let him cosplay Lewis and Clark more than once. After exploring the vastness of our small home, he returns to the same behavior, insisting that the bedroom is in fact the Northwest Passage and that Ming ceramics are best served broken.

Anyone else notice similar antisocial behavior? Is this something a frontal lobotomy or factory reset can fix? Or is it just the world we live in these days?"
"S7 MaxV Ultra Does Not Auto Empty Dustbin After Vacuum Task - When is auto-emptying supposed to occur?Technical question for the true Roborock nerds out there.  Google can't seem to find any similar issues (search results dominated by unsuccessful auto-empty attempts - my problem is with INITIATING auto-empty)

Recently replaced an S6 with an S7 MaxV Ultra (with the Empty Wash Fill Dock).  So far, it's mostly been working great and meeting our expectations.  The mopping was only a ""nice to have"" feature (but I am rapidly growing to appreciate it more).  The key is not having to manually empty the tiny dustbin 4-6 times per session.  We have lots of hairy pets, and in the past if we didn't really stay on top of things during a cleaning, the vacuum bin intake would jam with hair, and we might find half the house never actually got vacuumed (due to the hair clog) because we got distracted by something and forgot to constantly check the dustbin levels.  First-world problem, but surprisingly annoying after a while.

The routines and tasks are a major component of what makes the S7 MaxV great, but I've been noticing that the vacuum does not always auto-empty the dustbin in between vacuuming tasks.

Some background on my setup:

I have my house mapped and broken into rooms specifically sized to be well within the capacity of the vacuum dustbin.  In other words, small enough that the dustbin should never jam under normal circumstances.  I'd rather have the vacuum return for auto-empty more often than reduce cleaning efficiency or (worse) jam something in the docking station because it tried to suck out too much at once.

I have daily routines built within the app.  Some involve separate vacuum and mopping tasks, others a string of vacuum-only tasks.  For today, I had a routine scheduled that looks something like this:  
Task 1: Room A, Turbo Vacuum

Task 2: Room B, Turbo Vacuum

Task 3: Room C, Turbo Vacuum

Today I watched the vacuum return to the docking station between tasks, charge for a few seconds, then start the next task.  I was under the impression that the vacuum should auto-empty the dust bin between vacuuming tasks, but this doesn't seem to be happening.  I know that the auto-docking is successful between tasks.  I know the auto-empty works because it I can hear it happening occasionally (at least once per routine - need to pay closer attention to determine if it is ONLY at the end of each routine).

Other days I have routines similar to this:

Task A: Room A, Turbo Vacuum

Task B: Room A, Intense/Deep Mop

Task C: Room B, Turbo Vacuum

Task D: Room B, Intense/Deep Mob

On these days I'll notice the vacuum return to the dock after a vacuum task, dock for a few seconds, then start the following mop task by leaving the dock, turning around, and backing in for the mop clean before mopping.  All without emptying the dust bin after the vacuum task.

Today I called Roborock customer support to ask if the dustbin auto-empty is supposed to automatically occur when the vacuum returns to the dock after a vacuum TASK, or if that only happens at the end of a ROUTINE that included a vacuuming task.  The gentlemen I spoke to said he wasn't sure and took my email - hopefully the development team will get back to me.

If auto-emptying is supposed to occur at the end of every vacuum task (even if it's the 3rd task in a 6-task routine), then there is a problem with either my vacuum, the app, or both.

If auto-empty is only supposed to occur at the end of every routine, then that is an unfortunate limit on using the vacuum to its fullest potential.

The great thing about auto-empty after vacuum TASKS are that they are sequential.  I can have many strung together in a routine, emptying after each room, secure in the knowledge that the vacuum isn't driving around with a clogged dustbin intake and only pretending to clean.  If a task is interrupted to clean a sensor or remove a jam (even if it takes 30 minutes for me to notice), the routine just keep going until all tasks are finished or the battery reaches 20%.

If auto-empty only occurs after a ROUTINE ends, that is more problematic.  It means I have to have more routines with fewer tasks to ensure the bin is emptied more often.  The issue is that routines have to be scheduled, and if a routine is still running when the next one is supposed to start, then that next routine gets skipped.  Not the same sequential flexibility as tasks.  The next routine won't just start later if needed (like tasks do).  This is a much less efficient way to schedule the vacuum, since you have to spread the routines out with enough ""buffer"" so that the next one doesn't get skipped if the previous routine runs long for some reason.  I want to concentrate the vacuum cleaning to certain time windows, not have it executing spaced-out routines spread out over most of a day because that's the only reliable way I can get the dustbin auto-emptied between rooms.

Anyone else out there having this problem?  Is there some task creation / routine scheduling element I am missing?  Some known bug with a workaround?

Today I had to manually empty the dustbin after my vacuum struggled through 3 rooms (each a separate task) without an auto-empty - the dustbin was totally clogged with hair and not effectively cleaning when I shook it out over the trash can.  Preventing this is a major part of why I decided to upgrade in the first place."

"Roborock S5e (Max) shellHello, I have been looking into rooting my newly acquired S5e and installing valetudo on it following [this](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/rooting-instructions.html) guide with [this](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/s5e-cheatsheet.txt) cheatsheet. Disassembly went fine, soldering RX/TX went fine and I am able to get output into linux console. However, holding S and booting the device doesn't get me into the sunxi shell, with the console output blasting right past the ""[2.596]Hit any key to stop autoboot: 0"". I have tried:

Connecting my tx and rx to each other, verifying transmission on an electrical level.

Any help would be appreciated :)



Edit: the picture reddit is rendering from one of the links has nothing to do with my question, it's not even the same model"
"Roborock S5 Max hacked: being used as data mule?I've been running the Roborock S5 Max pretty happily for over 6 months now. It’s been really nice to have the vacuuming taken care of consistently: Win! However, in the last 3 weeks it looks like my *device has been hacked*. How do I know this?

**Answer**: Around mid December something started sending my S5 a giant truckload of data: almost 4 TB in an hour. Yes, you read that right: my robot vac ***was sent almost 4 TERABYTES*** in 3.5 BILLION packets. During that time, the S5 device attempted to transmit 468 GB (see image below).

[Graph of network traffic into the Roborock. The big green spike is a 3.5 billion packet dump, smaller spikes are 500 to 800 million packet dumps.](https://preview.redd.it/d2wv3unna7961.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=58e964f3c93768371c50aac2ff053e6a74b6acc1)

*Edit: Per discussions below, receiving or transmitting this much data is physically impossible for the hardware involved, so the working theory is that there is massive packet loss going on. Somewhat like pointing a firehose at a drinking straw, some of the water will get through, but most of it falls on the floor.*

This event, of course, pissed me off. What possible legitimate use case would there be for SENDING a robot vacuum 4TB of data? None that I can think of. I’ve done a little reading on the Roborock / Xiaomi devices and the data they generate from LIDAR scanning, but it seems like that would generate a much larger upstream (transmit) load, rather than an overwhelming amount of ***received*** data. I haven’t done anything to hack the vac. I have allowed it to update it’s firmware through the official Roborock mobile app, other than that, it is as it came in the shipping box.

I’m happy to hear explanations of this activity somehow being legitimate network use, but you better be damned convincing.

My response has been to limit the devices on my IoT network (which is ONLY this device at the moment) to a low bandwidth. This action seemed to stem the tide, but the device was still receiving almost half a terabyte every few days, usually during the dead of night, and sending out between 50 and 100GB during that same time. You can see those as the smaller green spikes in network use on the right side of the traffic graph.

Now, today, I’ve had two instances where the device was pushing more than a terabyte in an hour, one early this morning and another just after lunch time. This data dumping probably explains why the S5 vacuum suddenly got a case of the stupids during its cleaning run this afternoon: forgetting to clean two rooms and utterly failing to find its way back to its dock. Since my software networking restrictions don’t seem to be working, I pulled the S5 vacuum off the charger and powered it down.

I’m interested to hear comments, particularly about:

1. How to report to the Roborock folks that their device is being hacked (assuming they care).
2. How to shut down the jerks who are stealing a huge chunk of my bandwidth though my robot vacuum, aside from completely shutting off the vac and not using it, which I’m certainly considering.

Oh, and here’s my theory for what’s going on: The S5 device is being used as a data mule by some bad actors: dumping data to the vacuum in order to pass it on to some other location, possibly to hide the source of the data transmission. Based on the research I’ve done, the Roborock vacs are basically  embedded Linux boxes, and there is plenty of bad stuff you can get up to with unrestricted access to an operating system and a network connection.

# UPDATE #2 - 1/4/2021

Thanks for all the comments so far. Here's an update;

I powered down the Roborock S5 Max overnight. I turned it back on this morning to let it do it's Monday routine and the device has been very quiet, network-wise: not more than 100 packets sent or received over any 5 minute period for 90 minutes or so.

* I changed the Wifi password for the isolated IoT Wifi network that the Roborock has been on this whole time. After two attempts to reset the Wifi settings on the Roborock, it wouldn't get on the network with the new password.
* Shortly after these attempts to reconnect it with a new password, my Unifi switch went into an ""Adoption failed"" state, causing some devices on my regular Wifi network not to be able to reconnect (including my phone). Some of the disconnected devices reported ""DHCP configuration"" errors. I reset the switch and had to reboot the Unifi controller to get the client devices working again, and get the switch to be re-adopted.

This network breakdown caused one of my daughters to miss one of her online class meetings. By this point I'd had enough messing around with the vacuum and just shut it down. **I plan to do some more testing, and I'd appreciate any tips on how to do that**, but I'm considering my S5 compromised until proven otherwise. I still haven't seen a reasonable explanation for the network behavior I'm seeing from this device.

While it may be that Unifi is miscalculating the total volume of traffic, I believe it is measuring *something*. I also wonder if what I'm seeing is just massive packet spam coming into the device. Most of it doesn't make it through (e.g., 90% of packets gets dropped), but the packets are being counted anyway.

# UPDATE #3: 1/8/2021

Tonight I tried resetting the Wifi connection on my Roborock S5 Max again, using a new, longer password, per suggestions here. The Roborock is on an isolated IOT wifi network, so it can't talk to any other devices on my network. Here's what happened:

1. I put the Roborock in the ""Reset Wifi"" state.
2. I put my phone on the isolated IOT wifi network and fired up the Roborock app.
3. I connected to the Roborock through bluetooth and went through the steps to reset the Wifi. The app reported getting through 2 of the 3 steps, and then got hung up on the third step, eventually giving me the red X failure indicator.
4. I then pulled the vacuum off the charger and power cycled it (OFF --> ON)

I cycled through steps 3 and 4 two more times. Each time the Roborock reported a failure to connect to my network.

*Shortly after this, my entire home network stopped working.*

Both my Unifi Access Points and my Unifi switch were reported as ""Adoption Failed"" in the Unifi controller web interface just before that web application became unreachable as well. All traffic on my home network, wired and wireless, stopped flowing. I had to power cycle the Unifi controller and my switch and, luckily, everything came back up OK.

After I got everything booted up and connected again, I went back into the Unifi controller web interface to try to figure out what happened, and found this:

[Graph of network traffic from the \*mostly\* disconnected Roborock.](https://preview.redd.it/ner0w9xvp9a61.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0158620db06574fddbe3680e48905739b5e4dea8)

Between 9:35pm and 9:40pm, the Roborock \*DID\*, in fact, connect to my network (despite the Roborock app information to the contrary), and sent out 2 packets, totaling 724 bytes. Immediately following this event, all traffic on my network stopped. You can see this very clearly from this graph of several other wired and wireless devices on my network, below. All traffic stopped at 9:35pm, right after the Roborock sent those 2 packets, and it didn’t come back until I got both the Unifi controller and switch rebooted, around 10pm:

[Graph of network traffic from several wired and wireless devices on my network during the same time frame as the previous graph.](https://preview.redd.it/6q69dug3q9a61.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2d2989586e64a9320a9d2e8d6f3fc565b41fca5)

***I consider this data a smoking gun.***

It’s very clear to me that the firmware on my Roborock was or has been compromised, and that  software deliberately attacked my home network, with the intent to disrupt it. Clearly the attack was quite successful, if only temporarily.

I have no idea how widespread this issue might be. Hopefully, this is an isolated case, but I really have no idea. What I do know is this device has been part of an attempt to steal huge chunks of my network bandwidth for several weeks and has now attacked and disrupted my home network twice.

If you have one of these devices (specifically the Roborock S5 Max), I encourage you to treat it with extreme suspicion. You should take steps to isolate it from the rest of your network and other connected devices, or simply shut it off.

# UPDATE #4: 1/18/2021

Hey folks, this is likely my last update on this topic. Here goes:

Last weekend, I factory reset my Roborock S5 Max, per some of your suggestions, in the hopes that this suspicious network activity would go away. I really had no choice other than to reset the device, since after resetting my Wifi password several times, the device ***refused to reconnect to my network and disabled my network equipment*** in the process, on two, separate attempts.

Since my last post, I've made these updates:

* Factory reset my Roborock S5 Max
* Changed my wifi password to a significantly longer, randomly generated string
* Reconnected the S5 Max to an isolated Wifi network, by itself (no other devices)
* Throttled the bandwidth for that Wifi network to a max of 10mbps up and down
* Set up scheduled outages for that Wifi network so that it's only up for several hours a day, when the robot is supposed to be cleaning (so the network is unavailable the majority of the day)

Even after factory resetting the device and making these changes, the suspicious network behavior DID NOT STOP.

While the Roborock didn't take down my network reconnected it, the ***suspicious network behavior has continued,*** as you can see below:  

[My Roborock's network activity for the last 2 weeks. Note the continued massive spikes of inbound traffic while the device is allowed on my wifi network. \(I had the vac shut off from 1\/5\/ to 1\/9, before I did the factory reset.\) ](https://preview.redd.it/pl3bxy11n7c61.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4e9dfe0492620c0873a4812fefc3b769bbd8f19)

The only thing that has changed is that the behavior has is now at a lower volume, down to a peak of a 150 million packets received in an hour and 60 million sent. The lower volume is due to the bandwidth throttling I've imposed on this network, specifically to curb this ridiculous, if not outright malicious, network behavior.

***Resetting the firmware didn't get rid of the problem***, and it looks like my vacuum is now on a list of exploitable devices for who-knows-what purpose. What I find most alarming about this is that it means that whatever ***security exploit was in the original firmware that shipped with the device***. 

One more bit of data for you all before I put this thing in the incinerator:

[Summary of deep packet inspection findings from my Roborock S5 Max.](https://preview.redd.it/08myycyyp7c61.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be497a779ea4f3a86e671d67cc57c7f9810f3dee)

Apparently my vacuum is sending data to a social network called Miliao. What is that, you ask? I had no idea either, but apparently it's a [social network operated by Xiaomi](https://www.techinasia.com/miliao-xiami-music-sharing), part owner of Roborock. What the hell is a vacuum doing sending data to a social media site? I have no idea.

&#x200B;

What I find most alarming about this latest round of testing is that a ***factory reset hasn't fixed the problem,*** which means lots of other folks may be exposed to this problem. I was thinking that I might have got a compromised firmware update, but is seems like whatever exploit is being used came with the device.

Again, I encourage folks using this device to treat it with extreme caution, isolate it from the rest of your network, or just shut it down and stop using it, which is exactly what I'll be doing."
"S6 MaxV - AI Object Avoidance recommendations?I got a S6 MaxV around Christmas and after about a month of use I'm having mixed feelings about it. 

I find that while it is nice to have more consistently clean floors, this thing just needs so much constant attention and so regularly get's stuck on things or doesn't finish cleaning all the spaces it's supposed to that it's almost more of a hassle than it's worth. 

Here's a list of pretty normal things for a real human to have on their floors at any given time that really throw the robot for a loop: 

* Shoes
* Bath mats 
* Pet food/water bowls 
* Runner Rugs not securely fixed to the ground 
* Cords 
* Any moderately large trash like a napkin, or packaging plastic
* Clothing 
* doors that are sometimes open and sometimes closed 
* Miscellaneous trash cans or other small containers that live on the floor but are too light to trigger the wall sensor. 

There are so many things the object avoidance just won't pick up on, so even though I've added like 5 no-go zones the robot will still stupidly ram and mount on top of things and either get stuck or push things where they're not supposed to be. For instance, we have an entry way table we like to kick our shoes off under, so I no-go-zoned that, but heaven forbit one flip flop is sticking our a few inches past the line that's hard to visualize in the app, and then it will run it over and drag it into the middle of the room. Also, our bath mat is no-go-zoned, but you know sometimes it moves around a bit. I like to push it to the sink when I shave and if I don't put it back in the exact right spot again it get's mounted and pushed around. We leave our bedroom door at least 1/2 open every night, but even when there's plenty or room for the robot to come in, it just decides ""nah I don't feel like it"" about half the time. 

I'm no slob, and try and keep my place tidy but sometimes you just forget about a cord or just a sock that got tossed towards the laundry bin, but fell to the floor, and those things can completely wreck havoc on this thing.  So now, it feels like I have a 10min chore every night to move the rug, bathmat, any shoes, and stuff off the ground, and another 5min chore to reset the place in the morning. Comparatively, I used to use a Dyson stick vac and it only takes about 15mins to manually vacuum my whole place, and it's just done then. Not this constant repeated chore that causes nightly anxiety. 

I specifically bought this model in hopes that it would be smart enough to avoid things, but it doesn't seem to work the majority of the time. 

Has anyone had success getting the AI avoidance to you know actually avoid things?

Edit: I have tried cleaning the camera sensor."
"Returning S6MaxV (multiple issues)I wanted to like this robot so badly! I did a ton of research to decide what to update my Roomba 690 to. 


reasons for returning:


1.The biggest issue is that the robot detects a electromagnetic field in the MIDDLE of my dining room and as a result refuses to clean there. Support said over email that I should return my unit even though the answer seems simple (turn off magnetic no go line detection with an app toggle). 


2 The side brush is incredibly dumb in execution. When the robot goes on my higher pile carpet the main brush works fine but the side brush always gets tangled. The robot doesn't seem to know to reverse the rotation direction of the side brush to get free like my 4 year old Roomba does...(again...simple software update). 

3.I had to put white pieces of paper tapped to all the cliff sensors just to get my robot to go up on the rug. (another thing that can be turned off with a software toggle). 

4.It relies TOO MUCH on LIDAR without doing false positive checks with the bump sensor. What I mean by this is if it accidentally goes under a drapery or shower curtain then it shuts down and yells at you in the app that it can't see. (again, simple software fix to have it try and go back to the last known position by backing up or driving forward) 


As a software engineer in the medical field this just seems lazy in programming design. Specially for the amount of iterations this company has done to get up to this model. 


I'm going to try out the Ecovac's T8 AIVI and see if that's better. Really sad though given that their unit doesn't have a IR camera.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/15/2020)

I have received my Ecovac T8+ from Bestbuy. Got it set up, fully charged, ran a whole house clean. Here are my initial thoughts in comparison to the Roborock S6MaxV below.


1. It immediately was able to overcome the area with the high electromagnetic frequency. No issues what so ever. It held it's straight line pattern and was done super quickly. 

2. It had the same issue initially as the Roborock where it refused to go up onto my higher pile carpet. I took all the white tapped paper off of my S6MaxV and taped them onto the bottom of the T8. This solved that issue just like the Roborock. I say initially because once I solved the climbing onto the carpet issue it had NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER at cleaning the high pile carpet. Now _note_ this robot has TWO side cleaning brushes and neither got stuck in the 20 minutes I ran it on my high pile carpet, amazing. I still hate having to put tape over an $800 device, but at least it doesn't get tangled once up on the carpet.

3. It cleaned up my apartment in about the same time as the Roborock but did it in a different style. It split the rooms in half and would do half a room, then leave and do another room, then come back. I was worried at first because that seems inefficient, however on completion of the map generation, it merged / separated the rooms correctly and so now I can tell it to clean a specific room. 


4. Carpet detection is amazing! I didn't have to put ANY no go lines in my place vs the Roborock where I had to put some on the carpet as well as by the night stands where cables lay around and the cat bowls. 

5. Avoided the cat bowls. Got up super close but then recognized an object in the way, backed up, and cleaned around them. The Roborock would either not get close to them on some passes or would completely shove them out of the way. (granted the cat bowls are around the area that the Roborock yells about the EMFs). 


6. Seemed to pull much more out of my medium pile carpet. I don't know if that's from the rumors of Roborock's main brush overheating management or just something else. After running it just once there was so much in the dustbin that I had to clean it out by hand because the self cleaning couldn't do it. (This is known issue with self cleaning robots that you need to run them move often to avoid clogs). I JUST ran my S6MaxV last night on that carpet so seems better in that regard. 

------ISSUES SO FAR-----------
-only issues i've had so far in the app was splitting rooms in the app. Merging was SUPER easy but the splitting algorithm seems to want splits along existing walls. For instance I wanted to isolate the area in front of the cat's litter box to a room so I can tell it to clean that area specifically. The first split of the main room was fine but the perpendicular split wouldn't take. I ended up doing an angled single split instead which get 80% of the area I had intended. Will try and get that working better though. From my research this is the biggest issue with Ecovacs. 

-Since I had taped over the cliff sensors to get onto the high pile rug, it caused an issue where the auto empty station wouldn't start up at the end of a clean even though it said it was in the app. Removing the tape covers fixed it. I guess i'll have to come up with a better solution to get it onto the high pile rug but at least i know once it gets on the rug it will be okay. 

All in all I'm much happier with the T8+ so far. It tackled my two main issues ( high pile carpet cleaning and EMF areas) which staying about 99% on par with my S6MaxV. 

I will continue to update this thread throughout the week with further updates since I have until the end of the month to send either unit back for a refund. 







-------EDIT 09/16/2020--------


THINGS I LOVE!
Okay so this was freaking awesome. I remembered reading that the new T8's 3D object detection tech is using two cross shooting IR lights with a center mounted IR sensor.


 I have security cameras in my apartment that turn on when we aren't home since my apartment has a clause in our lease that says maintenance can come in at any time due to emergencies without advanced notice, which they have before . Just helps me keep at ease. Anyway at night they switch to IR mode and I was able to check out the IR from the T8 working in real time! I would also guess that night time might be _easier_ for the robot to navigate/ see in my apartment when the cameras are on because of all the IR light they project out. 


Here is what that looks like in the camera view 
[camera picture](https://imgur.com/a/myiMKrD)
I can't be sure, but it looks to have two side IR lights as well, perpendicular to the front of the robot. The object detection still is better than the S6MaxV. It's getting closer to my cat's water and food bowl to clean but won't run into the like the Max did. The Max always pushed them off the cat mat; maybe because the bowls are too reflective, idk. 


The self empty base station is awesome. A bit loud but only runs for 20 seconds a day and seems powerful enough to clean the filter.I was worried about that since a dirty filter after an empty would just make the robot's suction decrease the next run. 


Navigation has been great! It seems to improve every run and is going under all the chairs my Roborock would get too nervous about going through. 



-----------ISSUES SO FAR-------------
So i've had a few more software issues but again nothing game changing. After removing the cliff sensors so that the robot works with the self empty base station, it again wasn't able to go on my high pile carpet. I picked up the robot and put it on the carpet then told it to run. I then looked at the map and saw it was CREATING A NEW MAP and I couldn't see my old map. Had some slight uneasy feeling that I would need to remap my whole apartment again. I went into the map settings and tried enabling multifloor map saving. THIS WORKED! I immediately found my original map of my whole apartment and loaded that back up. 


For the time being i'm going to place my robot on the area rug and have it create a new map for just the rug until I work out a way to tape or press down the edges of my pile carpet so the vacuum can do the whole apartment in one run. Again, not a deal breaker by any means because it's still able to vacuum the high pile carpet once its on it and doesn't have EMF issues.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/17/2020)


-------The Good----------


I was asked by u/fishy6868 to run some comparison tests on the mopping functionality of both robots. 

firstly here is a picture of both pads and pad velcro plates. [Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/rBuCxpe)


[Second Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/OcVvd13)


You can see from the photos that the Roborock pad is about 10-15% larger than the Ecovac pad. 

I let the T8 mop my whole apartment (besides the carpets) and then compared the results to my S6 tests. I ran both robots on max water level with only one pass in each room. 


Both robots seem to mob about the same which is to say they aren't amazing, but the do a decent job in maintaining your floors for day to day. I personally mop because cat litter likes to stick to the wood floor which has a hard time being picked up by both robot's brushes. Each mop pad was similar in dirtiness when can on different days though I noticed the Roborock, despite a bigger pad, likes to get a lot of the dirt in more of the middle part of the pad. 


Some things I noticed in comparing the pads is difference in methodology between companies. What I mean by this is that the Roborock has a bigger pad but it's much thinner. I think this is because of the tighter tolerance between the mopping pad and the floor when the mopping pad is installed on the Roborock. 


The Ecovac has a MUCH thicker pad but there seems to be more play between the floor and the pad when the pad is installed which seems to be for angular adjustment of the mopping pad as it goes up and down different grades of surfaces. 


All in all I'm satisfied with the mopping capability of the T8 and don't see it as a driving factor in deciding between either robot. If the differences were drastic I might have more trouble deciding but since the difference is negligible then I'm fine with either if given the choice.  


The navigation keeps getting better. I HAVE YET TO PUT A SINGLE NO GO ZONE OR NO MOP ZONE IN MY MAP. It's amazing because with the Roborock I had to put a lot of them (by the nightstands where cables lay, by the cat bowl it never avoided, around the high pile rug that it would always error out on,etc). Simply amazing. It also has gotten smarter about going under my chairs which the Roborock never did because it never was confident enough to.




Haven't had simple map issue since I turned on multi floor mapping. 


-----The bad------


Okay so I took the cliff sensor tape off of all the sensors the other day when I found that they were interfering with the auto empty function from actually working for some reason. After removing these sensors the T8 is able to still get up onto my high pile carpet rug, but it has trouble with navigation once on it (probably from the sensors going on and off about different distances to the floor). I does a lot of side to side motions when trying to go in straight lines (like the guy who posted about his Roborock acting drunk). This doesn't seem to be a deal breaker for me though as much as it was for the Roborock because at least the T8 can clean 100% of my wood floor. The S6 didn't do that because of the EMF issue. Also, the T8 never spits out any errors or stops cleaning which the S6 would do a lot if I put it on that carpet.. 



Maybe down the road i'll figure out how to get it to be more reliable in navigation on the high pile rug. Again though, at least it can get up on the rug and doesn't error out when attempting to clean it. After a few days I am strongly leaning towards keeping the T8 and returning the S6MaxV since i'm not having any major issues.






-------UPDATE 09/19/2020----------

So I've decided that i've done enough testing; I'm returning the Roborock S6MaxV. The T8 is just much better fitting for my needs and has better avoidance. I also hooked it up to Alexa and I can confirm that it allows me to tell it to clean specific rooms or areas with my voice which is something I had wished the Roborock would be able to do. 


I contacted Ecovac support about issues with splitting rooms and they confirmed my theory which is that you can't split a virtually split room. You can only split along walls the LIDAR has confirmed. while that is a bummer, it's not a deal breaker and they said they aim to improve this in the future. I was still able to split 90% of the rooms the way I wanted perfectly. 


Still think that the T8 picks up more hair on carpet than the Roborock. Each day I run it on my medium pile carpeted bedroom and it fills up half the bin where the S6MaxV only filled MAYBE 1/4th. Also when I run my regular standing vacuum after a cleaning run with the T8 I get less in the bin in conparison.  


Navigation still isn't as perfect as the Roborock (it sometimes does little circles but maybe that's it trying to avoid stuff or navigate) but it's 90% cose to the Roborocks so the pros out weight any negatives in that regard. 


I will say though I'm going to miss the active community this sub has. Ecovacs has posts that are weeks old...


Hope this helps anyone trying to decide what's best for their home! Maybe in a few weeks when I get more data i'll add more information if anything changes but day to day everything has been great so seems pointless to still do daily updates. 


Cheers!


P.S It seems VacuumWars on Youtube gave the T8 a top pick over the S6MaxV for premium robot vacuum. Seems for Roborock you're better off going with the S5Max instead for the price to value. I think the S6MaxV is way overpriced at $750 currently."
"Mopping Streak Mop head needs improvement.I can’t be the only one. The mop head doesn’t apply adequate pressure and / or the mop itself is too thin leaving streaks and some areas unmopped. 

I think it depends on your surface so YMMV but it’s clearly an issue. 

I’ve tried pre-wetting and varying water flow.  

This is an inherent flaw in operation. 

Apparently some people are sewing cloth into the mop heads?

Can anybody link to that.

UPDATE: I took another of the mops, cut out the velcro , inserted it under the mop and used the velcro to secure the bottom mop in place. Now it works flawlessly.

Originally I had my SSID set to both 2.4 and 5ghz, I split it to two SSIDs for 5 and 2.4ghz and I can access the 2.4ghz on all my devices I tried. 

I have tried reset WIFI and try again
I have tried factory reset
I have tried reinstalling the app
I have tried installing the Roborock app

I have a USG (Unifi) and  Unifi Switch and AP
The security is set to WPA2

What else can I try? Do I have a defective device? I saw a lot of posts about this issue but usually people got it working one way or another. Some only after they waited a day (I just got mine today) so idk if I will have more luck tomorrow....  any help is appreciated."

"Fun new trick my S7 didI think it’s because I didn’t clip it back in properly after the last time I cleaned the brush but…

Today while doing a full house clean (I’ve run spot cleans since I cleaned the bar) it got itself stuck on the no-track mat at my cat’s litter box. That happens, no worries right?

Well to get unstuck it flung itself backwards and in the process ejected the brush cover and brush/beater bar. 

It took a minute, looked around, then went back to vacuum like nothing had happened - the poor cover and brush just left there in the hallway. 

I grabbed it and flipped it over (causing error 3 - wheels suspended) and clipped it back into place (properly and securely, I think) and it resumed when flipped back upright. 

So… now we know it doesn’t even need the brush to operate."
"Any news regarding privacy?Hey guys, I'm on the brink of buying a S5 and I'm concerned about privacy. I couldn't find any news that are more recent than 6 months so what ways are there to fix privacy issues like uploading stuff to servers and is the robot usable 100% even with the ""security fixes""?"
Any detailed privacy/permissions policy for Roborock?My partner wants to buy a S5/S6 but I'm not really finding any detailed reviews covering the policy and permissions of the vacuum. I also wanted to possibly root the device and run it with something like RoboRock Control Center but it looks like the newer models can't be rooted. I'm wondering if there are any other options that would help me maintain some privacy/security. I guess running it on a guest network?
"MAC address??Hello!  I recently received and am setting up my roborock S5 vacuum.  I have the mi Home app and have the Wi-Fi working with the vacuum now, but we would like to close the Wi-Fi network for more security.  Does anyone know where to find the device MAC address on the robot or via the app so that we can add the vacuum to our list of authorized devices and then close the Wi-Fi network again?"
Anyone have the roborock e35?My wife just bought this vaccum and for some reason when it connects to wifi it kicks everything else completely off the wifi and the wifi disappears from our wifi options on our phones and my security system.
"Can I use xiaowa c10 dock for S6 MaxV?As title. I’m trying to map my second floor, but I’ve already secured the dock on first floor with the double sided tape it came with. I do have a spare dock from the c10 I bought two years ago. Will that work with s6 MaxV?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I’m doing this so I can map second floor properly. It seems that the map will get erased at the end if it couldn’t find the dock for the first time.

Edit: I decided to experiment it myself and it turned out to be working just fine. Hope this is helpful to someone who needs multiple docks and have spare ones from the old models."

"S7, S8 or S7 max v plus?I am going to purchase a roborock, I will clean the dust bin after every one or two cleans so is there any other benefit of having the s7 max v plus ( which is $400 more expensive than the regular s7 or s8). Or should I go for an s7 or s8."
"FLIP A COIN: ROBOROCK S8 PRO ULTRA REVIEW (Australia)Are you on the fence about getting the S8? Well! I'm here to tell you that you should flip a coin to make that decision! Why?

 I have owned the S8 for about 3 weeks as of writing this review.

1. As of May 2023 - Roborock does not sell or stock parts for its S8 range. It cannot be repaired if there is a fault. If you are past your 4 week returns, you are out of luck and have a defective machine.  
2. My S8 leaks all its water when it tries to wash its mop.  
3. There is no direct line to Roborock Customer Service. After Service (which deals with technical support) does not have their number. Only contactable by email which means you wont get a response when you want to refund or replace.

So you either have a S8 that works perfectly (and you don't need to deal with Roborock's customer service) or you get a defective machine and need to wait for parts or a replacement (and have to deal with Roborock's customer service).

TLDR: If you like headaches - buy a S8.

"Upgraded my S7 MaxV Ultra with the Water Change Kit and the Mop Dryer and it is a gamechanger for meNo more smelly mop, no more smelly dirty water, no more running out of fresh water during cleaning while i am at work

So far (2 days in) it works amazingly, and, having opened it up before installing because i wanted to see how it works, i am fairly confident it won't set my house on fire or flood it as it seems to have adequate protections in place to prevent either."
"Buying Roborock S8 from CanadaHey there,

I live in Canada and I am interested in the S8 Pro Ultra. There is no information yet on the availability and I am curious what alternatives I have. Has anyone ever used a package forwarding service, meaning ordering it to a US address and then forwarding it to Canada?

Given the price tag of $1600, does anyone know what the fees are, or what the chances are that it doesn't go through?

Thanks a lot!"
"Roborock Q7 Max+ vs S7 Pro Ultra?I'm looking to get a robot vacuum to help keep my home clean (no carpets currently) and found that the Roborock Q7 Max+ is on sale for about £400 (albeit currently out of stock) which seems like a bargain for what I've heard is a very good robot vacuum.

For me, efficient navigation, good vacuuming and a self emptying docks are essentials. I wasn't originally looking for a robot that also does mopping, but it might be something that's good to have.

The Roborock S7 Pro Ultra £900, so a fair bit more! Do you think the added features/upgrades are worth it for that big of a price difference? Is the self cleaning/emptying mopping feature of the S7 worth it over the Q7 Max+? How much of a faff is a robot mope like the Q7 where you have to clean the mop and change the water?

Also open to other suggestions, including other brands!"
"Anyone observed their Roborock actually avoiding poop?Sorry to be so direct, but this ""feature"" is actually one that is fairly important to me.  

We have a small dog, who is potty pad trained, but sometimes he misses a bit.  I've always been afraid to run any robot vacuum when we are not home for fear of coming home to ""streaks"" across the floor.  Then I saw that the Roborock is advertised to certainly avoid that ""hazard"".  

I'm just wondering if anyone has a real-world example of their Roborock actually doing this."
"Which roborock should I get?Hello everyone, 

I’ve decided to pull the trigger on my first ever robot vacuum and I’ve been lurking on these roborocks for a long time. 
As to my needs, I currently live in a small apartment (about 50 sqm/540 sqft), tile only floor(except a small towel like carpet in the bathroom), no pets, no kids and not a lot of mess overall.

I am expected to be moving in a bigger place in a few months but floors are going to stay tile only and might adopt a dog in future (next year or so). 

I need it to keep my floors clean and require as little handling as possible (hence the ultra dock). Mopping also looks like a nice feature to have and not having to refill the tank and clean the mop all the time seems like it could save some time. 

I was considering the S8 pro ultra or the S7 MaxV Ultra since both have the dock that refills the tank and washes the mop, however the S8+ also came up as an option since I consider my apartment to be fairly clean so maybe mopping routine wouldn’t be so frequent as to bother me all the time. 

The S8 just launched where I live and it costs $1210 for the S8 pro ultra (after taxes) or $780 for the S8+. 
The S7 maxV ultra goes for $918 although it was on sale for $840 just a couple of weeks ago so I’m expecting to snap it for that price soon when it goes on sale again. 
Honestly, given the price difference the S7 maxv ultra seems more appealing than the S8 pro ultra, but would you guys consider a the S8+ be a better buy than the S7 maxv ultra? (regardless of price since they’re not too far apart, I’m wondering if the dual vibrating mop and dual rollers are better to have than an Ultra dock that takes care of mopping almost completely)

Thanks!"
"8 Month Review of the Roborock S7 Maxx V UltraDisclosure: I'm sure how this thing runs on carpet. Every area of the house mine covers is tile and hardwood (around 400 square foot cleaning area). It cleans the mop twice during its scheduled cleanings before finishing. This review is only covering its cleaning quality and maintenance needed, not the added features that come with the bot. If there are any questions, feel free to ask. That being said, my own experience with the unit is very positive. 

I bought mine September, 2022 and it runs every night at 8 PM. I also have the dryer module to dry the mop pad after every scheduled cleaning - As long as I keep up with proper maintenance, she runs beautifully with no issues. Every three days, I need to add water and detergent  to the clean water bin and clean the dirty water bin on the docking station. I clean the dirty water filter weekly, robot sensors monthly, and clean the bot and docking station once every 3 months (quarterly). I ensure the vaccum channel in the dock remains clear as needed, and replace the mop pad, dock mop cleaning brush, robot side brush, vacuum spin brush, and air filter, and dust bag when prompted. Keeping extra parts and supplies for maintenance on hand is the way to go. 

***Pros/Cons:*** The maintenance is a bit tedious, but it's far better than sweeping and mopping my home daily. It's quality of work is good, but it struggles in some areas. Larger objects can jam the brush and it doesn't do well with thick grime or caked on dirt. Large wet/sticky messes like this have to be cleaned up with human labor. This thing is primarily built to handle dried debris like spilled cereal, potato chip fragments, short hair, and light grime like dirt scuffs on the floor. I do a brief FOD Walk (Foreign Object Damage) before every cleaning to make sure there's nothing on the floor that can jam the brush. I see this as a good thing as it keeps me more conscious of my house cleanliness, and it takes far less time than performing a full-on cleaning with a broom and mop. Hard to reach areas are very limited based on the robots size and maneuverability, so some areas like tight corners and narrow areas will be missed. 

In all, I'd say this robot is exceptional for what it was made for, but it does come with some work and maintenance.

1. If you're expecting something that can take care of everything for you, then you're expecting too much. It has its limitations as described above, so expect light duty cleaning in most cases. 

2. If you're expecting something that can fully take care of itself, then you're expecting too much. This thing WILL save you time and work, but only by a third of what you might expect. You'll have to keep up with some scheduled tasks to take care of it, and routine replacement parts will cost you some money as they wear."
"S7 Ultra no filter error.So I have the S7 Ultra, really like it and it is fairly new.

It has quit several times do to a no filter / dust collector error.  Always in the same inconvenient places.

Spoke to tech support, he told me to buy new filters as there is a magnet in the machine that is not picking up the filter.

Anyway, I have not gotten around to buying and yet, again the machine is new.

So yesterday, this happened again and in the same location, clean dust collector and filter, did my usual caveman whack, no avail.  Moved it a few inches and it sensed the dust collector.   

So then the light bulb lit. I have a subwoofer in each of the locations, the magnets in them interfered with the robot.   I marked the areas as no-go zones and life is good.    Just wanted to share this in case anyone else has this issue."
"Getting 8s pro when It releases. Any other products you can recommend?As the title says. I’m sold. Going to be moving in a new home in the next few weeks and will be buying the new s8 pro. We are moving from a 2 bedroom apartment to a fairly large home 4500 sq feet. We have a Dyson Vacum (not sure the model) that we love using. We have a 1 yr old and a black pit/lab mix.

"Full bag sensorSo, I have an idea.

I'm switching from a Roomba S9 to a Roborock S8 Ultra as soon as available. Something I'm gonna miss is a full bag sensor alerting me to the need for a bag change. 

My house is fairly ""smart"" and a lot of my things are controlled by a SmartThings hub (I'm OG and have been using this since before the Samsung acquisition).

Today I started some research on how I can create my own full bag sensor and will try it out when I get my new vac, but wanted to share the idea in case others had some thoughts on accomplishing this.

I'm planning on buying a pressure sensor ($12 on Amazon) and a simple open/close sensor ($30 on Amazon).

I've learned that I can wire the pressure sensor to the open/close sensor so that when pressure is detected, it will trigger an ""open"" status, which would then be set to text my phone alerting me to a full bag. The hope is that I attach the pressure sensor in a way inside the canister that as the bag fills, eventually it will exert pressure upon it.

In theory, I guess it should work. What do ya think?"
Want to sell my Dyad ProIt literally has 15 minutes of runtime on it... brand new.  Can provide receipt.  I got the S8 Pro Ultra and won't use it enough to justify the cost.  I still have the original box/packaging.  PM me if interested with how much you think is a fair price.
"Bought S7 MaxV Ultra used for 2/3 of original price, but is it a bargain? Please adviseHey, gang!

I saw a deal for a returned to shop S7 MaxV Ultra for 2/3 of the price tag for a brand new unit (1,000 eur vs 1,500 for brand new). Reseller listed it as “unpackaged, may have scratches or dust on the unit”. 
It looked clean-ish, apart from some minor dust, so I took it home. 
However, after I paired it with my phone, the app showed some (IMO) pretty heavy usage - 108 h usage time, 2,971 km2 cleaned area, 135 cycles over the span of 30 days - https://ibb.co/YjNsPwN

Should I return it? As people that have been using these for a long time, could this have potential impact on the work of the unit (e.g. battery life, mechanical issues, etc)? Assuming I do maintenance as advised - https://ibb.co/Qnmvdzq

Thanks in advance!"
"12.12 sale. Help me make a decision on which roborock to buy.Edit/ bought the MaxV 

Would be the first time using a roborock. I’m thinking of the S7 without the dock, then I went down the rabbit hole of seeing Q7 S7+ S7 Max etc.

House would be 700 sqft (two bedroom apartment), tiled and wooden flooring. 
Two working adults with the occasional golden retriever during the weekend. 

I’m interested in having the mop function. As a female, I drop hair 😭 and the golden retriever shed fur as well.

"Should I wait for the S8 Pro Ultra or pull the trigger on an S7 MaxV Ultra now?Got a fairly small ish 3 bedroom apartment with all hardwood floors, but 3 sizeable (low pile) rugs. Couple dogs, one sheds like crazy but so far we’re ***just*** managing with a shitty older iRobot. Been eyeing the S7 MVU and was going to buy one but decided to wait until the CES announcement. Now that the new model’s been announced, not sure if the double roller brush would really do me any extra good with predominantly hardwood floors. Self drying sounds nice too but it’s not like people were having a lot of trouble with the MVU. 

Any thoughts? Also, when would be a good time to buy an MVU if that’s the way I decide to go?"
"S7 Max V Ultra loud grinding sounds — assistance?We’ve been using our S7 Max V Ultra since it came out (8 months?) and really enjoy it. We try to perform proper maintenance on it, clean it, and have replaced parts as needed since we run it almost every night. 

Just recently it has started making a loud grinding sound and I can’t find the source of it. [My video with audio here](https://youtube.com/shorts/EmaVwjMpANY?feature=share). Do you all have any idea where it could be coming from? I’m fairly handy and I used [this YouTube Roborock disassembly video](https://youtu.be/TKMD-VOvILc) that shows complete disassembly and got it down to 2 minute mark. Below is what I found…

- No substantial debris that could be causing the sound
- All motors checked out and do not make sounds when manually spinning: the motor up top, the side brush motor, each wheel motor, and the underneath brush motor
- I blew out the unit with air and dust did come out but again nothing noticeable
- I removed and cleaned the front 360 wheel

It all reassembled easily and when testing found the same loud grinding was there. Any recommendations on places to look? I’m hesitant to break the robot down any further because I then have to start removing sensors. Thanks!"

"Roborock disconnects from wifiI bought my Q5+ a few weeks ago.  Since then its disconnected from wifi on 4 separate occasions.
Im able to re-pair it fairly easy.  But the most recent issue it was in the middle of cleaning and just stopped.

"Bricked / Unresponsive S6 MaxvI have a 2.5yr old roborock S6 Maxv unit and has been working without a skipping a beat for 2.5 years, I dont use mop functionality, and yesturday morning it was showing as disconencted from the app. 

1. So following the steps listed in the app I tried to re-pair to wifi, but as soon as I held the buttons down to reset it, the power light started flashing white.
2. Next I tried Resetting it, by holding the home button, and then pressing the reset button till the power button starts flashing. (power button never stops flashing, assuming firmware was not reset)
3. tried removing the battery and putting it back in, Power button is still flashing. 

at this point I am fairly sure its bricked, and the cost to repair is gonna be around 300 from roborock with shipping.

Any one had this issue in Australia? are their any other options?

"Is anyone noticing issues with the latest firmware for S7 MaxV Ultra? (02.56.02)Hey all,  


I recently purchased the S7 MaxV Ultra after tons of research and the Black Friday sale that was going on. Everything led me to the S7 MaxV. However, it seems to be getting stuck and sucking up everything that I would expect with all the features it has.  


For example, I do have cats, so yeah, they're like toddlers, and sometimes they leave toys out, so I was curious how it would run with these left out, and the roborock straight clobbers them, and they're fairly larger toys too. I've noticed it sucking up a cord, running over a shoe and getting stuck on it, and even a blanket. I feel like I'm babysitting this instead of letting it perform.   


Am I wrong to assume it shouldn't be doing this? My less expensive shark would avoid these with no problem. I upgraded to the Roborock for the more advanced features, as well as mopping and mop cleaning at the dock.   


After some research online and on this sub, I've noticed a few people in the past have problems after recent firmware. I'm on the current one, or at least it shows that it's up-to-date for me (02.56.02); is anyone else having these problems? I feel like for over $1000 USD, it should at least be avoiding bigger objects like a shoe."
"AI obstacle avoidanceHey everyone,
I've just made the switch from ecovacs x1 to the s7 MaxV and am LOVING it so far.

My question is if anyone else has the AI obstacle recognition randomly detect an obstacle where nothing is actually there? I have a couple of pictures from a recent clean detecting an obstacle in an empty space and then adjusting to go around it, which slows it down for no reason.

Is this fairly common and worth just turning the feature off?"
"Question for those who recently bought S7 MaxV Ultra from AmazonWhen Amazon ships something without an additional box (in other words, just slapping a shipping label on the manufacturer's box), it usually notes this on the item's page (says ""ships in packaging that shows what's inside"" or something like that).  I don't see any such note on the S7 MaxV Ultra's page, but I'm still a little nervous because it's apparently a fairly large item... if you've bought one of these from Amazon recently, did it arrive inside a separate shipping box or not?"
"Roborock S7 carpet performanceI'm looking for some advice here.  I got an S7 a couple weeks ago and I love pretty much everything about it but the performance on carpet, even on the highest setting seems weak.  I swapped out the brush for the Q5 brush and that seems to offer a bump in improvement.  My old neato D7 can come out after my S7 has run and still pick up nearly an entire dustbin.  Is this just the case on carpet or is there another brushroll that someone would recommend or maybe my machine has suction issues.  Hopefully I'm not offending any current users as I do agree the software is vastly superior to my Roomba S9 and Neato D7."

"Roborock S5 Max odd behaviorRecently I've updated my Roborock S5 Max to 4.1.2_1642 (which would be analogous to 2.16.42 AFAIK) and I have several mapping issues since the update.

First of all the robot bumps a lot against corners of doorframes and such. Something it didn't do before. And second of all the straight lines cleaning is gone altogether. [A screenshot to illustrate this](https://imgur.com/a/WoDWgp9).

Second of all it thinks it's dock is crooked against the wall, but in reality it is straight against it... 

I already tried re-mapping the place, but issues persists. And just now when I tried it, the mapping was all over the place. Taking forever and missing quite a bit of the room.

We already tried cleaning the sensors and the LDS unit with a cotton swab and some alcohol. Also tried to [push the robot manually](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MiBkw_lcTF8) but that didn't make a difference either. Currently we're at a loss.

"Roborock - Great Technology - Terrible Customer Support - but do I buy another?As per the title really - their products offer cutting edge tech but zero aftersales support in my experience.

I purchased an S7+ in April - its been great until a few weeks ago it started reporting 'Error 4 - cliff sensor error' - it seems a fairly common problem on these models (Google it).

I'd purchased through [amazon.de](https://amazon.de) \- they advised me to contact Roborock EU support which I did.  Their response was that they don't offer product support and to go back to the seller (Amazon).  I then sent them screenshots of the product on Amazon's page clearly showing they (Roborock EU) were the contact for aftersales support and warranty issues.  After many emails backwards and forwards they eventually sent me a link to a service company in the Netherlands.  I contacted this company only to be told they don't service products from outside the EU (I'm in UK).

3 Further emails to Roborock EU and two to their Global Support email have all gone unanswered!  

Thankfully after complaining to Amazon about this they have agreed to accept it back and provide a full refund.  If it was any other seller I'd likely be stuck with a broken robot and zero support.

So I'm really disappointed with this - whilst it seems no other robot vacuum/mop does the job quite as well as the Roborock, I'm very reluctant to purchase any of their products again - purely down to the seemingly  common fault of cliff sensor error and the lack of aftersales support.  I've a really old Roomba that I've used for 10+years and now cleans my top floor - its never let me down as yet.

So has anyone else had similar experience of Roborock's 'support'?

Anyone suggest another brands product that works as well cleaning hard floors that also provide half decent aftersales support?

Is the cliff sensor issue 4 as common a fault as it appears to be?  Is it still an issue with the S7 Max V Pro (assume it likely is)?

Thanks"
"Roborock MaxV 6 suddenly deadSo I just got back from a short holiday to find my Roborock MaxV 6 offline and dead on the dock.

Since the dock light is off and switches on when I lift the bot, I'm fairly sure my dock is okay.

The lights on the bot stay dead, no matter how well I position it on said dock. It also doesn't give a startup tune or voiceclip to indicate charging.

Wiped down both sets of charging contacts for the hell of it, even though they were clean anyway, no dice.

I did notice the front top part (around where the battery should be) feels warm to the touch after standing on the dock for a while. Not hot, but noticeably above room temperature.

The unit has been in use for less than a year (december 2021) and never made any tumbles (only used on ground floor).

Pretty sure this is a lemon and it'll be up to the vendor to sort this out, but just in case: any ideas what the hell could've happened in the 3 days I was gone? Unit didn't move during this time."
"Cliff Sensor Error made my S7 MaxV stuck on a stool pedestalSo I have these barstools with fairly flat pedestals and my S7 MaxV recognized them as obstacles. I wanted it to ignore them because they’re flat pedestals so I manually disabled them. However I just got a notification for a cliff sensor error and now my vacuum is stuck on one of the pedestals for some reason. I can’t manually pilot the vacuum either, so it’s just sitting there on top of a pedestal which is no taller and no steeper than a door threshold.

Emptying the dust bag. Roborock S7 Max V Ultra.So I was thinking how I could save money on replacing the ultra dock dust bags and I wanted to get your opinion. The bags fill up really fast because we have two dogs who shed a ton. Would it make sense to use our normal vacuum to suck out the hair and dust from the dust bag and reuse it? Our normal vacuum does not use bags. It would be fairly easy to do but wanted to get some feedback. Hopefully they come out with the washable bags soon. Thanks!

"What is the purpose of the Matrix map?I just got an S7 MaxV Plus for our apartment, love it so far, and am just experimenting with all the bits and bops.

However, the one feature I can't make sense of is the Matrix map. What does it actually do? Is it just for how I view the map in the app, or does the Roborock actually use it somehow? I just can't seem to find any information on this.

It just feels like an awfully complicated thing to set up for a fairly poor result if it'd only be useful for viewing the map (I mean, I know what my place looks like). Is it just one of those useless marketing-only features?"
"Self empty not getting rid of small hairballS7

I've had the self empty dock for about 5 months now and it seems to empty the bin fairly well most times.

I just changed the dust bag a few days ago and did a quick run. In the dust bin is a very small, light, dog hairball that is not dense at all. The type that even the slightest breeze will blow it away... More of a dust bunny. 

After running the self empty, I noticed it was still in the dust bin. I ran the empty cycle 4 more times and it just won't come out. Now, I can easily empty it on my own, just curious why it won't get rid of this, but hasn't had issues with big hairballs in the past.

I confirmed all filters are clean and the bag is aligned properly.


Any ideas?"
"Workaround to Spectrum Community WiFi? S7 won't connect since 5Ghz signal.Hi all,

We recently moved to apartments and they have Spectrum community wifi, i.e. it's part of our ""benefits"". Sigh. Anyway, I have no control over the internet other than to connect to it. As such, I'm fairly certain most of my devices are connected to 5Ghz. That means that my S7 will not connect.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to figure out a workaround? What I've tried so far...

\- Setting up a hotspot on my android phone, allowing 2.4Ghz bands only - for a non-tech savvy person, I thought this was genius. It didn't work.  
\-  Hosting a hotspot from my PC - my network card doesn't support this  
\- Hosting a hotspot from iMac - that's a no-go since iMac will only let you do this if you're connected to the internet via an ethernet connection, i.e. can't connect via wifi AND have allow other to connect to the iMac via wifi  
\- none of the ethernet connections dotted around the walls will give me an internet connection

Thanks!"
"Roborock s7 maxV ultra questionsSo I just got the vacuum last week and love it. However I have some questions. It seems like it washes the mop both after it’s cleaning and before it starts the next clean. Is there a reason for this? It seems to waste a lot of water. Also in my upstairs it is mainly carpet and I keep my base on the ground level. The dust bin seems to fill up fairly quickly, before it can finish. It is around 1200 ft2. Do you recommend a second base? Or just do a few rooms a day? Last question. If I map the house, then move away the clutter the next day will it adjust the map? Or I have to make another map?"
How does the S7 MaxV handle very large floor plans?Possibly a question for those with fairly large floor plans or studios. How does an S7 (or any other robot vacuum) handle it? Does it stop several times to charge while it's in the middle of cleaning? Would it know if the dust bin is full and go empty mid-clean? What else should I keep an eye out for?
"Anyone have an S7 with extreme amounts of pet hair?We have a [newfoundland](https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Newfoundland-standing-outdoors.jpg).  Needless to say, we have a fairly extreme amount of pet hair to deal with in our home.  

We previously had a Roborock S4 vacuum.  I really liked the navigation, mapping software, and how it cleaned, but it just wasn't able to handle the pet hair well.  I was having to clean the brush daily and replace the brush every couple weeks due to how much hair was getting wound around it while cleaning.

We got a Roomba i8+ after that and with the rubber rollers it does a better job of dealing with the dog hair.  I only need to clean it out 1-2 times per week and replace the rollers maybe every 2-3 months.  My problem is that the navigation and mapping software are terrible compared to Roborock.  It takes the roomba 50% longer to clean our house and it constantly misses spots.  I'm also unhappy with how it's built since one of the wheels just fell off the hub so now all it does is spin in circles.

I'm considering getting a Roborock S7 since it also uses a rubber roller rather than a brush.  Does anyone have one with similarly large amounts of pet fur to deal with?  How does it work if so?"
"Ultra Dock clean water tank with black scum?Anyone else find black scum in their clean water tank on the Ultra dock? The only thing I am adding to regular tap water is the Omo floor cleaning solution. Not sure if there is a connection between the two or not. Caught me off guard when I went to refill the empty tank. 

The black scum was fairly easy to spray out. Just not sure why it was there in first place."
"Roborock S6 MaxV vs Xiaomi Vacuum Mop 2 pro+Hey fellas

Im considering one of these two, but I don't know which one to choose.

"Discount on Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra in USHey all,

I’ve seen a few posts on discount for this vacuum, just wanted to give a heads up.

The vacuum is now carried at Lowes online and it’s fairly easy to get 10% off lowes coupons on eBay (mine cost me about 10 bucks).  So it knocked down the vacuum price to 1260 before tax."
"China T7S+ vs T8 vs T8+?Looking to buy my first robot vacuum! After doing some research, Roborock seems to check a lot of boxes for me in terms of price and cleaning hardwood floor dirt/dust, long hair, dog hair and dander. I think I'm happy to compromise a bit of sucking power for price, but I'll definitely be wanting a version with the dock for self-emptying. Our house layout is fairly simple. 

What are the differences between the T7 plus, the T8 and the T8plus in a nutshell? Which one might be the best for my needs?"
"S7 reset factory settings every runlike I spoke with the seller the robot is not working properly, it turns off during a longe period of time and when wake up after few minutes do the same thing. I spoke with roborock support and look like a hardware problem. 

I've tried everything to run it without problems and 4x I could run the robot it end the same way, it stops on the middle of the cleaning and says, some random erros and after reset, this reset factory settings took a long time to be able to turn on the robot. and after it rurn on I need set up everything again, connect WiFi etcetc so do you this this is fair for a person who buy a 377£ product have this situation? 

The seller keep saying this is a error 1, and tells me to clean the ladar. 

 I received the product on 24/05/2022 and today is 26/05/2022 I didn't have opportunitie to enjoy it. because it never worked.

Someone has the same problem ?"
"S4 Max vs. S7 Vacuuming ComparisonHi all,

I currently have a S4 Max, which does a fairly phenomenal job vacuuming my hardwood floors and low-pile carpets. However, I see the s7 is now on sale, and I'm considering purchasing one to replace the s4. I know the s7 has the mopping feature, which will be nice, but how does it's vacuuming performance stack up against to the s4 Max? Some reviews indicate that the s4 might actually be better.

The only reason I would make the upgrade is to get the added mopping feature and the docking station, but I don't want to lose any vacuuming/suction power in the process. Thanks in advance."
"S7 (MaxV) Questions About Dog Hair/Bin SizeI have a few questions about the current S7 that may or may not apply to the MaxV version just announced. I currently have a Neato D5 that's starting to feel a little long in the tooth but has served me very well. I was planning to go with another Neato but the new D8/9/10 aren't impressive for the price and the mopping features of the S7 would probably work great in my home but I do have a few questions maybe you guys can help me with:

I have long haired german shepherd that sheds a fair amount of hair. I run my D5 daily and even doing it daily, the 750ml bin is often nearly completely filled. The S7 seems to only have a 400ml bin - at roughly half the size i'm concerned it won't be big enough. With that I have a few questions:

Does the S7 alert you when the bin is full?

If you have the + Variant with dock, does it automatically return to dock to empty itself if it fills the bin before completing the clean?

Can I buy a non + variant and add the dock later?

Does suction power decrease noticeably as the bin fills?

Does anyone have any experience with the S7 and hair tangles? After about a week my Neato D5 brush is completely filled with dog hair and needs to be cleaned - is the S7 better in this regard?

Thanks for responses in advance.

Best Roborock under 325?I am looking to replace my Xiaowa.  It’s held up for two years using it daily but it’s dying a slow death and I want to replace it.  I don’t need a mop.  I can mop myself.  I do need one that does well on medium pile carpet and handles pet hair because we have 3 cats and a dog.   It would be awesome if It works with my iPhone or at least as a remote.  I just don’t want to invest a much money.  Our home in 1 level and fairly small.  TIA :-)
"S6 Error 11 and Error 17 issue fixedPosting this here in case it helps someone with a similar issue. Our S6 robot had been working fine and has logged around 1060h and 66K m² without any major issues but was well out of warranty. 

We started getting Error 17 - ""Side Brush error. Reset device"" and noticed the side brush would not spin all the time. It would stop and start on plain tile floors and throw the error constantly.
I pulled out the side brush motor which is fairly easy and checked the gears and they weren't stripped - they were in good condition actually. I ordered a new side brush motor assembly and figured I'd put up with the error until it arrived.

Then suddenly the device started giving Error 11 - Strong Magnetic Field and the robot goes backwards in an arc when you start it. It was basically unusable from this point. I read a bunch of forums and it wasn't looking good. I reset the device back to factory settings and re-flashed the firmware. I tried upgrading and not upgrading the firmware and it doesn't seem to make a difference.

Anyway, the new side brush motor assembly arrived and I put it in and restarted the robot and amazingly it seems to have fixed the problem with Error 17 and Error 11. I can only assume something in the side brush motor was causing the Error 11 Strong Magnetic Field issue."
"Roborock S6- Error 10 Clogged Filter - the real causeSo I’ve had my S6 for about 18 months now and about 6 months ago it started complaining about error 10 filter is clogged, that’s fairly well reported on this model

I purchased new filters, cleaned the dustbin, even blew out the robot with an airline.  Each time within a few weeks the error was back

So I stripped down my S6 to find out why.  Takes about an hour to do but is pretty straightforward.

The cause?  The intake to the motor was almost totally blocked with dirt and hair.

Once cleaned and reassembled the S6 is performing like new again.

I’ve had to do this twice now, both times the same cause and result.

I’ve 2 dogs, tiled floor and the S6 is used everyday.

In my view this represents a design flaw on the S6 which allows dirt to get trapped on the motor intake and prevents the robot working well.  Wouldn’t be such an issue if it didn’t take so long to get to the motor to fix.

I’ve got a 10 year old Roomba too and never had any such issues.

"Need help choosing a model!I've been looking for a Roborock vacuum cleaner and stopped on two models -   


S5 Max  
S6 MaxV(around 70 euros more expensive)  


From my research, both should be good, but I'd rather ask people who actually use those just to make sure. I have two concerns:   


1) I have a cat(Scottish Fold, hair fairly short), it shouldn't be a problem, right?  
2) What I'm mostly concerned about - Most of my rooms are separated with a frame/ramp or however you call it, depending on the room it can go up to 3cm tall or so. Are those robots capable of climbing those?  


Other than that, I have a carpet almost in every room except for kitchen, so there's a lot of places where the robot should go from the floor onto a carpet. So any recommendations are very much appreciated!"
"Just Get a Roborock for Black Friday? Make Sure to Check the Main Brush on Carpet.I sent back my S6 MaxV a while ago because the brush was stalling on carpet. ([See my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/jeuzb8/how_to_check_if_your_main_brush_actually_works_on/)) Hoping the issue was isolated to the S6 MaxV, and because I'm a glutton for punishment, I ordered an S5 Max while it was marked down to $440.

I received it this week and unfortunately the main brush issue on new vacuum is almost as bad as the unit it replaced.  It doesn't spins for any significant time when doing the perimeter pass on carpet. It does work a little more when it's just going back and forth in the middle of the room to be fair. 

[Here's some video.](https://i.imgur.com/SeRY1HU.gifv)

I won't even bother contacting Roborock about the issue this time.  Numerous people have reported this issue to Roborock and they still haven't acknowledged it and continue to gaslight customers by telling them this is a feature and not a bug.

If you just received a new Roborock, be sure to follow the [instructions in my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/jeuzb8/how_to_check_if_your_main_brush_actually_works_on/) to check the brush function on carpet. 

In addition to the brush issue, my new S5 Max also seems to be having trouble with the front bumper sensor. When it contacts an object straight on it often just drives into it for 30 seconds to a minute. 

[The wheels are driving the entire time in this video.](https://i.imgur.com/JKGIVQ2.gifv)

All things considered I'm giving up on this and all Roborock vacuums and sending it back. I've ordered a Deebot T8+ to try. At the moment it's on sale for 450 at Best Buy with the bin emptying dock."
"maintenance on Roborock S7Hi there,  


I was wondering what kind of maintenance everyone does on their Roborock s7.   


I have a house with a fair few pets (2 dogs and a few cats) so the vacuum does the living room / kitchen every day.   


I am noticing that the main turning wheel does get pet hair in there too.   


But to keep the robot in tiptop shape. What is the best way to maintain it?  


Also, what accessoires / replacable part set is the best out there at the moment? (I am European so preferably a european link).   


IS there much difference between a S7 compatible product and genuine Roborock stuff?"
"Roborock Sentiment vs Roomba Sentiment (forums)There are a few negative posts on this forum. I'm NOT criticizing those; some are warranted. But there are a lot more positive comments here than negative. 

I'm on the Roomba forum as well - mainly because I'm somewhat interested in an M6. The number of negative and problem posts there *VASTLY* outweigh the positive. I read every post on both, and there is a decidedly different tone between the two. Roomba certainly has their fan base, but overall, the posts are not as positive.

I've been impressed with the carpet cleaning of Roombas, but the navigation issues are real. The RR allows me to literally not worry *at all* about the navigation - set it and forget it. I would MUCH rather have *pretty good cleaning* and *excellent navigation*, than excellent cleaning and fair navigation. 

I get problems getting OEM parts in the UK. I get the no-roller turning on some units here in the States (although I have VERIFIED mine turns). But before you jump ship, you might visit the other forums. I have, and the informal analysis indicates Roborock has some of the happiest customers.

If Roomba comes out with LIDAR, then I'll be looking at closer comparisons. For now, I am an EXTEMELY happy S6 MaxV and S5 Max user. 

Just my random observation on a Monday morning."
"Which Roborock to get??I've been doing loads of reading on robot vacuums and have decided to get a Roborock, but there are so many models I'm lost!

My place is about 1500sqft single floor and no carpets, no pets. 2 young kids. Wires are on the floor and some clutter.

I'm considering the S5max or is there a better /newer model I should look at? Or even an older/cheaper model based on my needs? Definitely need the mopping function though.

Help please!"
"Thoughts on extended warranty?I picked up the Roborock S7 on prime day as my first robot vacuum and we're in love. Today I also grabbed the 3 year extended warranty from Asurion, so I should hopefully be covered for malfunctions through June 2025

Does anyone have experience with this warranty? How fair are either Roborock or Asurion with paying out on claims?"
"Cleaning solution on pad?I have dark (chocolate) hardwood floors and I worry about whether using wage only will perform poorly while mopping.

Roborock says not to put cleaning solution int the water reservoir because it will corrode the internals. Fair enough. But what about soaking the mopping pad with a floor cleaning solution before you run the mopping program? Since they recommend starting with a wet pad it would seem a smart move to use a cleaning solution.

Has anyone done this? how well does it work?"
"Roborock S5 Max vs S6 Maxv vs S7Hello, I’m fairly new to robot vacuums, and I’m having a hard time making decisions.

I was going to purchase the S6 MaxV, however, I noticed a lot of bad reviews due do its brush not spinning on carpets. I do have carpets at my house...

So is this an issue for me? 

What are the main differences between the S5 Max vs S6 MaxV other than the camera? 

I heard the new S7 also has issues with the carpets, so should I proceed with S5 Max and save some money as well?

Lastly, I was reading somewhere that even the new S4 models have issues with the brush spinning on carpets... Could it be the same for the S5?!"
"Picked up an S5... im underwhelmed?Previously had a dumb roomba 805 that took some water damage.  Double rollers, rubber extractor brushes.   Suction power of 600pa.

It worked fine for my needs, but if i had to replace it I was gonna nerd out and get something technically cool, and a i found an S5 that met my budget.   

Technologically it super cool, but it seems to be a fairly poor vacuum compared to the roomba, especially on carpet.   

The roomba would really agitate the low pile carpet fibers, leaving big stripes on the carpet as it ran over it, wheras the roborock just kinda floats on top and doesnt scrub the carpet at all.    

From a quantitative perspective, the roomba would fill the dust bin in one room, and i ran the s5 over a whole floor and it only half filled the bin.    

Am i missing something here?  Carpet mode is on.   I dont notice it leaves things dirty or gritty, but it just doesnt seem to pick up nearly as much, or agitate the carpet."
"Are we certain that all Roborock S6 versions are not broken? Main brush not working on carpet.I just bought an s6 and went to look what people are saying about this robot vacuum and found the problem of the main brush not spinning on any carpet. Sure enough my main brush only spins part of the time (turns on for a second, off for several). My question is, is there anyone on this sub whose s6 (any version) actually spins the entire time? I am fairly convinced that the entire line up of s6's does not work. It really sucks because the mapping this thing does is amazing and I love the mopping functions, but the fact that my Roomba 690 actually cleans my carpet and this one that is significantly more expensive doesn't do the 1 thing its supposed to do is kind of heartbreaking.

"Testing Battery S5/50 USAI have an S5 I received 2nd hand fairly well used. Worked great for me for about a year. Recently, I started getting the dreaded charging error - I think “13” clean charging contacts. They are clean.

Robot will keep trying to dock itself over and over after cleaning & can’t charge. Seems to be worse right after cleaning (warm), after it sits a bit & goes dormant - seems easier to dock (charge).

I did some research & it seems the common fault for this is a PTC/resettable fuse on the motherboard. Seems to make sense, as it seems slightly worse after running.

So far I’ve checked voltage at the dock empty (4.2v) and voltage from the charging ports underneath the robot (10v fully charged). Also, the robot & sensors are cleaned & well maintained. This is the only issue. 

I’m assuming it has the original battery, I saw testing voltage at the battery should be around 16v fully charged? I’m assuming the 10v at the charging ports is intentional - but not sure?

Battery life seems ok. Robot does my smallish 3 bedroom ranch home complete & finishes with about 25% charge - which is why I’m leaning towards resistor - not battery. 

But, I know battery voltage alone isn’t necessarily a way to say a battery is 100% good. Any experience / advice with this?"
"S6 MaxV vs S5 Max - how useful is obstacle avoidance?I've never owned a robot vacuum before and I'm deciding between the S6 MaxV and S5 Max for my first purchase. It seems that both these vacuums are fairly evenly matched in most areas (cleaning, mopping, quality etc.) but the S6 has the edge in obstacle avoidance due its front cameras that can detect and identify objects.

How useful is this object avoidance feature? We aim to keep the house relatively uncluttered but there might be occasional clutter in terms of small objects (eg toys, shoes, pet trays). I'd prefer to run the vacuum daily with minimal intervention on my part so I'd rather it not get stuck or have to rearrange clutter to prepare it for cleaning.

Does the S5 Max also avoid small objects effectively in most typical cases or is it much more likely to get stuck? Anyone who has owned both, do you find that the S6 Max is significantly more independent? I also wouldn't necessarily mind if clutter is just pushed around here and there, as long as it doesn't get stuck or require intervention."
"Queue tasks? Scheduled queues tasks?Hi!

I am the happy owner of a Roborock S7. My wife loves it and kids finally stopped being scared of it. All is well. 😎

There's one feature I cannot find and it makes me sad. Is there a way to queue tasks, or better, define scenarios that would define a specific task schedule?

For instance, I want my kitchen vacuumed and then deep cleaned. The only way I know right now is to :
 - go to the app, chnge my kitchen room setting to ""vaccum""
 - ask Google to vacuum my kitchen
 - wait for the operation to be complete
 - go back to the app, change the kitchen setting to deep clean
 - ask Google to vacuum my kitchen

Since deep cleaning requires to pre-vacuum the room, I am certain not to be the only one hopping that this feature exists.

I would love to have lal these actions to be automated and triggered in one shot (be it from the app, or from Google Assistant, although I am fairly certain that last bit won't be possible)

Thank you in advance!!"
"New to robot vacuums, any precautions or tips?I finally bought a roborock s6 to help control my cat tracking litter throughout the house and also for her fur/ hair.

However I am very nervous after a test run in which it seemed to not see certain obstacles. For some walls it was fairly precise but for instance a door stopper it kept banging into fairly hard while backing up and moving up slightly but hitting it again and again.

So I'm curious how do i deal with instances like that, or that we have a brick fireplace that's round in shape so it seemed to almost come close to scrapping alongside.

Also for mopping, I'm not really seeing it or i am just blind but can i have the mop set up constantly alongside the vacuum or do i need to set it up for mopping every time i wish to mop.

A lot of YouTube videos just seem to be reviews on its overall ability to clean."
"They can take a beatingWe had a fairly heavy 6 foot folding table set up yesterday for a relatives birthday party and in my laziness, I folded the table and set it behind a door to be put away later. Long story short, we heard a loud crash last night and found the table on our S5 Max. I lifted the table up and Hazel just sat there moving back and forth a few inches. I was sure she was gone but I paused it, moved it over a foot or so, started it and it resumed cleaning. I ran it again today and it works fine."
Test: S7 with cleaning solution on pad on Dark Hardwood FloorsI decided to run a test mop on my dark hardwood floors. I decided to spritz the pad fairly heavily with Bona floor cleaner. As you can see the floor came out clean but there was noticeable streaking left behind. I then rinsed out the pad really well and re-mopped this section and the streaks were gone. Sorry I don't have a pic of the final result. Overall I'm happy with how it turned out. I'm going to be doing other tests to see how it does with just water in one pass to see if the two step cleaning (bona then water) yields a better result.
"WiFi dead zonesHey,

I have a fairly large house and my WiFi can't cover most of the rooms. Quick question before making my purchase, do some of the advanced features, especially the scheduled cleaning work properly in WiFi dead zones? How about the map, suction power and the rest of the app features? Dock will be near the hotspot. Was also thinking of using an old router as a WiFi extender, if I can't move the router closer to the middle of the house. Thanks in advance!"
"S50 with roborock appYes, I know that is not available.

I want to know if there's a way to jerryrig the s5 max firmware unto the s50 since theyre fairly similar.

&#x200B;

I recently got an alexa echo and the mi home skill is simply not good enough. has just 2 commands for start and stop. the roborock plus skill though in comparison is actually very useful.

But since the roborock s50 is only compatible with the mi home app, it can only use the mi home skill.

So I want to know if I can change the firmware of the s50 to that of the S5 max, or get it work another way."
"S5 Max - WOWThis machine is incredible. Arrived today, charged it up, threw the world at it. It was pretty messy as I hadn’t vacuumed for a few days prior to this, so I had to empty the canister twice. But now it will run daily and it should be good - that’s the only downside I see, canister could be bigger."
"Export map layout for floor plan?Is there a way I can export the Roborock map? I am guessing these maps are pretty accurate on the dimensions. I want to make a fairly accurate floor plan of my house, I was about to break out the note pad and tape measure and then I realized my S5 Max has already done the hard work of measuring for me."
"Question on S6 MaxVReceived my new Roborock a few days ago.  I am replacing a Roomba i7 and have to say the Roborock is light years better!  It does a better job cleaning and the navigation is WAY smarter than the Roomba.  I love it!  I even tried out the mopping and feel like it did a very nice job.  

Quick question on the mopping feature though.  I filled the water reservoir with distilled water.  After mopping my kitchen and entry the tank is still about half full.  Can I leave the water in it or do I need to empty it out?"
"Leaving mop head on for the dayHi guys,

I've bought myself an S5 MAX and I have to say, love it! We were shocked on how well it did on its first run.

I'm planning to use it around 2/3 times a day with scheduling, one full run on turbo setting in the morning to clean after last day. Second run around 4 pm after dinner, just kitchen and 3rd run around 9pm, just kitchen with mop.

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, we don't really have a time to remember to put the mop back before 9pm, I was wondering if we could just put it back in the morning and leave it there for the day and before we go to the bed just wash it?

Will it damage it somehow or is it fine to leave it for the day? In fairness its only one room with not a lot of mop zone. Also could I just leave that mop for few days and clean it like once a week? I'm planning to use 70/30 water/vinegar solution.

&#x200B;

I'm attaching a photo of my map. No. 1 name ""Kuchnia"" (excuse me for polish words).  Yes the mop zone in front of charging dock is unfortunately a carpet. I did wanted to put the entire carpet into no-mop zone but the app won't allow the charging dock to be inside that zone so I'm hopping it won't be much of a problem. The entire docking station with the robot is on the carpet under the dinning table as this was the only place we could leave it safely to work.

"Impressed but annoyed with Roborock S5. Are my expectations too high?I've had my Roborock S5 for 6 days now as my first robot vacuum and while i'm impressed at the cleaning power and it's overall ability, i'm also annoyed at some things.

* It mounted the base of a chair and got stuck, which wouldn't seem too difficult to dismount itself but couldn't.
* It sometimes has a fairly loud vibrating noise on carpet (low pile).
* It sometimes seems to take itself out of carpet boost mode in the middle of the carpet.
* It has slammed into outer walls even though it's already been mapped and quite clearly a wall.
* The map is saved but doesn't seem to get any quicker at cleaning, infact it has gotten marginally slower.
* Why does it it leave sections (rooms) unfinished, go off elsewhere then come back to it later?
* Why does it seem to go over tracks it's already been?
* In my map, the bottom right and top left, it stops before the end of the room rather than doing one long run.

Had less than a week and already changed filter and cleaned brush. Is there something I should be doing that i'm missing?

UPDATE: Happy with new firmware, it has cut cleaning down to 47 mins from 55 and does it in a more logical fashion.

"S5 brush blockedI got the S5 in November. For the most part I love it. But every time I run it on my carpet I get the “brush is jammed” error.   It does get a fair bit of hair tangled around the brush but that’s it and it doesn’t look like enough to cause a problem. The hair is just from my three girls, no pets. Is this expected?  How can I fix this so it will make it through a cleanup?"
"Just upgraded my Neato Botvac 75 to an S5 Max. Wow.So my old(ish) Botvac 75 never turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for. It did a pretty good job at cleaning, everything was noticeably cleaner after it did its job, but I often thought it was too much hassle to keep running than it was worth. It kept getting stuck, having sensor issues, the UI was a hassle, side brush falling off, battery detoriorates fast too, all in all I never thought it really helped me out keeping the house clean. I ended up using it less and less, 2 times a week at first, then just 2 times a month and lately I've just been using my old trusty Dyson.

But the Roborock S5 Max has blown me away. I got it mostly because of its mopping functionality, but it's just an overall better vacuum in every single way than my old Neato. It gets into corners better, I can use it remotely with the app, great features...it does get stuck, but does a better job at getting unstuck than the Neato, which just kept trying going back and forth indefinitely, as if the 30th time it tries it should magically work. The S5 Max tries different motions until it gets unstuck. The mopping is not perfect, but it leaves my hardwood floors noticeably cleaner, especially after a couple runs. The battery is a big upgrade too, should last a year more before it needs replacing probably.

It really is what I had hoped the Neato was, back when I got it. And fairly cheap too as I got it on AliExpress.

Only things I don't like: the mopping leaves stripes on the floor, only visible in sunlight though. Also it doesn't climb doorsteps better than the Neato, it struggles going over 15mm obstacles. 20mm is out of the question.

Over all I love it. Fantastic gadget that actually makes my life a little easier. Big upgrade over the Neato."
"Which RoboRock?Hei

Sorry for not really being able to discern this one from all the info in front of me and similar threads here on Reddit.

Family of 5, kids 2-11, no pets. This robot vacuum would be on a 50m^(2) floor that is pretty simple to navigate. One 2cm threshold that could be made even lower. Mostly hard floors and one large shallow hard carpet. Danger of some Legos, beads, dollclothes, the odd pancake and such.

Don't care about the mopping function since our hard floors can't take it. Don't care about noise since we are not going to be here when its on. Don't care about recharge rate. Don't care about unit height since all our furniture is over 25cm of the floor.

Do care about HEPA level, dust container size, ease of cleaning, part replacement and maintenance. This vacuum might be used on other floors but dumb navigation should be enough for those rare uses. Simple scheduling should be enough but I do want it to restart automatically after recharge if it doesn't finish. Do care about battery size and lifetime longevity.

S4 doesn't seem to be available in my country but would probably be fine for our use. S5, S5 max, S6 and S6 pure have a very similar price.

\# is money/price.

S5 48#

S5 max 44#

S6 Pure 46#

S6 48#

Also if you think of some non Roborock candidates, I'm all ears although I'm pretty biased towards them."
"Dock Charger Restricted SpacingI have some candidate locations for the S4 dock, but one centralized location that I was considering has a little less than half a meter available on one of the sides.

Has anyone in a similar situation placed the dock in such a space? If so, how have your results been?"
"Roborock S4 - Error 5 - Main bush is blocked - Resolved!My new S4 would constantly stop in the middle of it's cleaning cycle and give me an Error 5 - main brush is blocked.  After checking the main brush and finding no issues I finally just started resuming it without checking.  When this happened on tile floor with nothing around it I knew the vacuum had a problem.  I contacted support through Amazon and to my surprise they knew about the issue and had a firmware update to give me.  This appears to be an update they will release in the future and I am the beta candidate for them.  I did clarify with them that this firmware only addressed this one issue and nothing else.  So far after 1 day I have not had the error which previously would have popped up 2 or 3 times in one day.

The new firmware version is 01.02.92 and is 110 MB.

My old firmware version with the problem was 01.02.66"
"Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra LDS Error 1, motor was fine // Repaired Successfully.Just sharing an experience I had with my Roborock S7 MaxV.  


I got a whole kit from eBay. It was listed as not working, but for $540. I couldn't pass it up, as it came with the dock (just missing the ramp).  


I had the ramp replaced from buying a heater module which came with a modified ramp to begin with.  
The dock seems fine and no issues there...  


The S7 MaxV itself didn't seem to have issues initially. I tried to make it go to the dock which was a couple ft away. And it would report an Error 1 / LDS issue. The head clearly looked like it was spinning. I do have another brand new MaxV and in comparison it didn't look like it had anything wrong with it.  


I did a 'quick mapping' after trying to get it to go home which consistently gave me errors. But the quick mapping seemed to work... Weird, I had started to use it for a few days doing a new map when i finally brought it from my workbench to the floor it would end up stay at. After a few days, it stopped working and reported that same LDS Error 1.  


Having educating myself with online videos, I decided to remove the LDS and closely inspected it. No hairs, or entanglements whatsoever. Even did some test runs with the 2 large lids removed, and the center head off. Just to see the LDS spin, but again would report an LDS Error 1. I know I got it used on eBay but from the condition I received it, this doesn't looked like it was used more than a few hours or runs before it getting re-sold off online. Probably an Amazon Return, I've noticed others getting DOA's LDS Error 1s here on the forum.  


But I can't return this sucker. So after waiting 3 weeks, I installed an entirely new LDS module that was \~$40. The ""broken"" one that was inside, did look differently. The 2 wires the motor was hard soldered to the PCB, and didn't have a removable plug like the replacement I got. Also theres 2 thin blue wires that seem to go somewhere into the center of the spinning array. These wires were soldered onto the board as well as the replacement one had a connector. The little sticker both named the ""Model"" as the same model #. But its clearly a different revision. Not sure if hard soldered model is a newer or older revision.  


Anyways, I have it working now with the new LDS module. In the end, saved over $800 so its a good deal. I'm just happy I didn't have to replace the Motherboard, which looks like a PITA to get to (requiring nearly full disassembly).  


Hopefully this inspires others you can repair these things.  
FYI, Roborock US Support basically said they couldn't do anything to help, even when I asked I'd be happy to send it in for repair for a fee, or if they could sell me the LDS part. They said to return it to whoever I got it from for a ""replacement"" obviously not an option in my case, well it'd be morally incorrect to pull that on an eBay Seller who specifically marked it exactly as described. So ended buying from another vendor overseas which is why I waited 3 weeks."
"Cleaning brush with dish soap, made it less effective ?After having my S4 Max for about a year, I finally decided to try out scheduled cleanings. All was great until one Saturday morning I discovered it had engulfed a sizeable volume of cat vomit whilst I was sleeping in.

I cleaned the whole unit with a damp cloth and some elbow grease but for the brush used a few drops of Dawn dish soap.

Ever since I had cleaned the brush with soap, the vacuum seems to be lacking in it's performance e.g. leaving behind some fur on the carpet and less thorough cleaning around the house in general. I'm convinced I may have altered the brush's performance with the soap cleaning. Perhaps it could have made the bristles less stiff and therefore less able to 'dig' for dust/dirt particles in the carpet pile?

I'm considering buying a replacement to confirm, but am weary as I've heard they don't work quite as well as the one that comes with the vacuum. I've stayed on top of preventative maintenance tasks so can't figure any other causes. Has anyone had a similar experience to this?"
"Having fun with roborock outside of it's purpose 😀We got the Roborock S6 about a month ago and love it. I actually enjoy the trial and error of creating no mop zones and no go zone boundaries.


Now that everything is set up perfectly, I've been playing with the features no one really uses i imagine like an immature child. 

Things I have used her for in the past couple weeks


* Remote control - My first attempt i drew a heart in the living room and sent it to wife. She loved it. My next drawing was a little more provocative. I laughed, she didn't respond. 


* Pin n go - Wife was watching TV in the living room and had some crackers. I sent to spot clean randomly in front of her. She laughed. This morning I'm at work around 7am, and sent it to the front of our bedroom, played the hello message, and docked her. She's usually up but I guess was still sleeping. I guess I should have assumed if she was asleep that would scare her pretty bad, that Karen had become self aware.

It did. She called and was not happy. 


Along with other suggestions as to fun features with Roborock, I think the moral to this thread is while you are learning no go boundaries with your roborock, you also learn boundaries in marital/roommate relationships. 

Happy New Year 😀"
"A Story About a Great Robot DetectiveWith remote learning in full swing, I bought my daughter a sturdy stand for her tablet. It's very adjustable and made out of metal, so it should withstand a first grader. To accompany the metal and prevent a tablet, or the stand itself, from sliding, it is covered with silicone in various places. Of those places, at the ends are two small silicone pieces and, one day, my daughter lost one of these.

We looked around the area for the piece, but couldn't find it. We also looked on the couch, the carpet and in her back pack, but no luck. The real problem is this tiny thing is gray, and most of the space is faux wood flooring that is also gray, so there is little chance of seeing this thing. I even layed on the floor in the hope of seeing a slightly raised gray thing somewhere, but came up short.

My daughter was sad. The tablet stand would slide, annoyingly, on occasion often. After a couple of days, I told my daughter I'd figure something out. The next day, while emptying the vacuum bin, I noticed a small object peeking out of the dust and debris. It was the tiny silicon piece! My robot detective/servant scoured every inch of the floor and ""presented"" me with this precious item!

My daughter was overjoyed and found a new appreciation for the overlooked robot servant! We put the silicone piece back on and all was well, until we lost the same piece on the other side! I told my daughter not to fear as our robot detective would present it to us after its nightly run in the morning! She was excited to see what would happen in the morning and, when the morning came, our robot detective solved the case again!

I've since glued both pieces back on and, well, they've fallen off again. And, yes, the robot detective found the pieces every time. I'll be using a different glue very soon.

  


If you've read the story this far, I hope you found it cute. The moral of the story? Pay a little more attention to the dust and debris your robot servant regularly gathers for you. There could be ""diamonds.""

Cheers."
"Help me decide Roborock Q7 Max+ or S7+Tossing up between Roborock Q7 max+ and S7+ but looks to be about AUS$300 difference. Can't afford the ultra so have to give up self cleaning/auto refilling.

Both come with docks and mopping. I have 2 level home with tiles and wooden floorboards and a couple of rugs.

Not sure if the S7+ is worth the extra coin as there is a good eBay deal on both.

I read on an earlier post that the S7+ does mapping on 2 floors. Is that the same for the Q7 max +

Thoughts?"
Please Help!!! Lost Roomba!!!
"S8 Plus or S8 Pro Ultra - please help me decide!Please help. Every time I go to hit ‘buy now’ I get cold feet. I can’t stop flip-flopping between the S8+ and S8 Pro Ultra. 

I can afford the Pro Ultra, but at the same time I don’t want to pay over the odds for something that I want worth the huge price difference and make that much difference to my life. So is it really worth it?

My concerns, other than the cost, with the ultra dock are - 

1. It’s huge, but I can compromise if it makes my life better. 
2. There is more to go wrong, and customer service is apparently very poor. 
3. I read that some people change the water after 2 - 3 mopping runs. So am I really going to save myself that much work. 

I know I want an auto empty vacuum, that’s a given. I had a Roomba and would not go without a dust auto empty bin. But I don’t think I will mop my oak floors every day, maybe once or twice a week at most. So will the Ultra dock really save me that much work? How much hassle is an S8+ for mopping when you don’t have auto mop cleaning? How long can you go before having to attend to it?

"Urgent Help Needed: Amazon.de Delivery Delayed, Seeking Advice!

Hi everyone,

I recently ordered a Roborock S8 Pro Ultra from Amazon.de with an expected delivery date of May 24th, 2023. However, after contacting customer service, I was shocked to learn that my delivery might be delayed until July 10th due to difficulties in finding a shipping company to transport the item to the UK. This situation seems extremely odd, and I'm feeling quite frustrated.

I'm reaching out to the Reddit community today to seek advice on how I can potentially speed up the delivery process. Has anyone experienced a similar issue with Amazon deliveries or international shipping delays? Are there any strategies or actions I can take to ensure a quicker resolution?

I've already spoken to customer service, but I feel like I need more options and suggestions to address this problem effectively. I'm eagerly waiting for this item, and the thought of waiting until July is disheartening.

Any guidance, recommendations, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your support and insights!

TL;DR: Amazon.de delivery of Roborock S8 Pro Ultra to the UK is delayed until July 10th due to difficulties in finding a shipping company. Seeking advice on how to expedite the delivery process. Any suggestions, similar experiences, or tips are highly appreciated"

"Need help with Roborock S6 MaxV auto carpet feature not deactivatingHello all.

First post here asking for help. 

Had my roborock for about a half year now, super happy, no issues. 

We have a dog and today she dragged a tiny toy with her for about 20 seconds. I could hear it because I have the auto carpet mode enabled and she started using turbo. I paused her, removed it and continued. Since then the auto carpet turbo mode doesn't turn off anymore. 

Our whole apartment is hardwood except a few tiny carpets here and there (where the carpet function has always worked exceptionally well). But now it seems she treats our whole apartment having carpet. If I turn the mode off she goes to the selected balanced mode, if I turn it back on then she goes full blast. 

I wiped all sensors etc but can't seem to make her happy about it anymore.

Before I go for a full reset and wipe (I already did the first stage reset), are there any suggestions? Thanks in advance. "

Is carpet boost likely doing much for me? If I turn it off is it likely to be missing a lot of dirt/dust? Or given it’s not picking up much anyway due to frequent run am I unlikely to notice a difference?

"Help Request: my roborock s5 gets ""lost"" when cleaning my bedroom, why could that be?Hello there, you wonderful hive-mind,

I have this trusty Roborock S5, my robotic companion for the past four years. I adore it, but boy, is it acting up since we moved! It's got a thing for the master bedroom. It's like it's playing hide and seek but is just terrible at finding its way back. Gets ""lost"" - a fancy way of saying, it forgets where its charging dock is! And the map it creates afterward? It's like a child's imaginative drawing - all these phantom walls and rooms. Here's what I mean:

And there are times when it dreams up a whole new house! Can you imagine? Now, I've tried the lot: ask it to give the whole house a whirl, did the solo room dance, even the master bedroom only jig with zone cleaning. But nope, it's stubborn as a mule.

Now it's no biggie really. When it gets tired, it just sleeps (aww), and I have to play the hero and carry it back to its dock. But honestly, it's a bit like having a naughty toddler. Any of you geniuses got a clue why this is happening or what I can do? Loads of thanks!"

"SO many models. So confused.Finally getting around to replacing our 5-year-old generic robovac. Mostly hardwoods here, but a few area rugs and a carpeted basement we vacuum... once in awhile.

Everyone says roborock is the best, but I get overwhelmed looking at all the different models. Roborock's ""help me choose""and model comparison features aren't leaving me feeling any more confident.

What I really want is a high-end vacuum with a bagless dock and no mop. Does this exist?

I want the high-end features like high suction, room mapping, zone cleaning, self-emptying (no bag!) And the reason I *don't* want a mop is because I don't trust the hands off systems to not make a horrible mess at the dock and I also don't want to do the regular maintenance that comes with the less-advanced ones that you fill yourself. Easy enough for me to just bust out the swiffer and do a room as needed.

I know I could buy a high-end one with a mop and just not use it, but that feels like wasting money on a feature I don't want.

Roborock doesn't have any bagless docks, right? Should I go with Shark instead? Looks like their app is a dumpster fire, though.

Can you make a recommendation? Where do I belong in the robovac world?"

"[S7 MaxV Ultra] PLEASE HELP!!! Auto-Emptying jam every 2 days (I am on the verge of giving up...)First of all, here is the situation. We have 2 fluffy huskies. They are the whole reason I need robot vacuums.  I came from top of the line iRobots, about 6 months ago, I swapped the irobot to MaxV Ultra.

I run the robot everyday, mop every other day. The auto empty bin always always Jam. It happens every other day.  The jamming spot is the connection point of the dust bag. There is 90 degree curve from the machine to the bag, dog fur always.. ALWAYS jam right there at the 90 degree turn.

\-----------------------------------------------

I am a research heavy guy.. I searched reddit, Roborock official forum, Facebook group.. Here is what I have done. 

1. set auto empty mode to Max.   => nothing has changed.. Jams every other day.
2. Check blockage in tube => I unscrewed the entire tube, no blockage,   Dog fur always stuck at the 90 degree dust bin connection point
3. Make sure the dust bag cover is connected tightly. => To make sure its tightly sealed, I even put a 5 lb weight on top.
4. Check circular filter underneath the dust bag. => spotlessly clean, not even 1 piece of durt
5. Making sure the rubber Roller cover insertion is inserted correctly => there is a 3 tab insert for the roller cover and it could affect auto emptying dock suction power, it is installed correctly.
6. Checking if the air outlet plate is removed from the robot.  =>  If the robot and dock are purchased separately, you need to manually remove that plastic piece on the robot. I purchased the whole system together and double checked the plate, its not there. 
7. **this is an extreme step.. I was thinking it might be a defected product.. so I bought another off amazon... about 3 weeks back.. I ran it for 3 weeks... Same thing happened about 1 week and half ago..** 

\-------------------------------------

I am starting to give up.. This is almost more finicky than my robot lawn mower... 

**One thing I noticed is that if I put in a fresh bag, I would have about 1 week of blockage free. Once the bag is filled about 1/4 of the way, it jams constantly.**  

Now my solution is to replace these bags every week.. But this is a wasteful and stupid solution..

&#x200B;

WE REALLY REALLY NEED THE **REAL** SMART EMPTYING.. IN IROBOT LINE-UP, ITS HAS THE BIN FULL DETECTION, so whenever the robot bin is even semi full, it goes back to the station.. I think roborock emptying suction is just not enough.. Or it waited till the robot bin is too full, then all the junk gets stuck in the tube.

"Please help choosing between Roborock Q5+, Roomba J7, or ......... 

Hey guys. I've researched more than I'd like to admit and still confused on what to get. My house is 60% hard floor, 40% carpet. Own 1 small dog. (never poops/pees in house. Just sheds a little)

Features I'd like to have:

1. Be able to spot clean a section of the house from the app. For example, if kitchen bar needs clean, I can spot clean a specific part of the map from the app.
2. robot avoid objects in floor. IE underwear/clothes, shoes, etc. Also want to identify on the map areas that robot can't go/bump into.
3. auto dispose bin would be great but not absolutely essential.
4. built to last. They are expensive and I expect it to last 10 years+. Only plan to buy extra brushes and battery replacement etc. down the line.

Roomba J7 pros:

1. better carpet cleaning, object detection for small objects like cords. Apparently roborock isn't as good as J7 bc it doesn't have camera. Easier to get replacement parts?

Roomba cons:

1. for price of q5+, doesn't have feature #3. Supposedly still has horrible mapping (bumps into objects all the time like the old school roomba did/do?). Doesn't use lidar.

Roborock Q5+ pros:

1. better mapping, more features. value for price (feature #3)

Robo cons:

1. doesn't clean carpet as good due to dual brush.

I'm leaning towards the roborock. Seems like most people agree it's significantly better overall. I think the only reason I'd go roomba is for better carpet clean and maybe easier to get parts down the road. I'm torn and would love some help.

I've also looked at Dreametech D10 Plus, Shark - AI, ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T10+. None of them seem to be as good as name brand roomba or roborock. I'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks!"
"Awful customer serviceI know this will probably get down voted since Roborock is a very beloved company on this forum, but would like to share my experiences anyway. Hoping it helps others.

I have seen numerous posts on here about people having their S7 scratch their floors, I have always had a blind eye to this as I never had any visible (to my eye) scratches with mine. Recently i have been hearing what sounds like ""scrapping"" happening on my floor. Upon further inspection I noticed I have all kinds of ""surface scratches that show up in just the right light on my floors. (not happy....)

From here I inspected the bottom of my vac and noticed on my plate that holds in the brush, near the wheels there are very heavy worn away plastic tabs. From here I place a couple of felt pads on these areas and no longer heard any scraping of any sort on a run.

Upon further investigation I found that you can replace these plates for $20 on Amazon which in the description they state. (rubber pads prevent floor scratches).

Now my issue is, nowhere in the maintenance does it mention I need to or should look out for this at any time. I never knew I should have been worried about replacing this or it going ""bad"".

When i call Roborock , they completely deny any of this and state that only the wheels touch the floor and it would be impossible for their product to scratch the floor. After multiple attempt's. They literately blocked my number! I know this cause when i try to call the main number on my main phone, the call no longer goes through, when i used my work phone it works just fine.

I will say this, they make wonderful performing vacs and their app is top notch. As a for their customer service, they are just awful!

I have emptied the dustbin internally, cleaned all the parts, checked for capacity in the dust bag, etc. Is there some part that needs to be opened up and manually unclogged?

Something to mention: Initially the vacuum used to do a thorough job of picking up the pet hair. Now it rolls them up and leaves clumps on the carpet. Wooden floor is cleaned well though.

Thanks in advance for any solutions."

"Help a S5 UserHi, 
I have been using S5 for ages and it is time to bid goodbye to it. I can't decided whether I should wait for S8 to be available in market or get S7 MaxV now (with $210 off).

Allow me to summarize what I am looking for that might have you guide me:

* I have 95% floor of hard wood and only two rugs.
* I want to use it for mop but I don't care for the auto water, auto clean, etc stations. I like to replace water, dry mop cloth myself. That's how I am doing it for s5.
* Even though I have a small rug, I want it to be vacuumed really well. S5 doesn't vacuum the rug well.
* I don't care about camera and all that, I care for my privacy/data as well (separate thing)


Thank you in advance! 😊"

we are currently using the S7 and we use on one floor in our house, we have 2 dogs, a cat, and a 5-year-old :)

"PET HAIR on CARPET: S7 Max Ultra vs S8 Pro Ultra - Which is betterHi Everyone,

I am torn in picking which machine to get as I've been seeing mixed reviews for both.  
1. This review says the S7 Max Ultra (S7MU) is better in picking up debris in the carpet (not tested with pet hair) - [https://youtu.be/4ldZCNkksgw](https://youtu.be/4ldZCNkksgw)   


2. This however says that the S8 Pro Ultra (S8PU) is better than the S7MU - [https://youtu.be/y3-iyHqHEF0](https://youtu.be/y3-iyHqHEF0)    


3. I also want to clarify, the sucking prover has been increased from the S7MU to the S8PU, but is it affe cted by the opening of the roller brush (1 on S7MU vs 2 on S8PU)?   


4. Also, i know i can jsut purchase the drying dock separately for the S7MU, is it comparable to the one in the S8PU?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for your responses. Would love to be able to sort these questions out to make my purchase decision clearer.

"Need help picking up a model for my parentsI've been struggling to choose the model for my parents house between S7 Pro Ultra (in France) that is getting cheaper, S7 MaxV Ultra or to wait for S8 Pro Ultra.

Some details about their house

* Only hardfloor, no carpets at all
* They have dogs ( bernese mountain and long hair chihuahua)
* Place is currently easily getting dusty and slighly dirty (paws mark) because of how muddy the outside can be, so mopping is pretty important.

I don't know if the S8 Pro Ultra is really worth the price. In theory the dual brush could be better with pet hair, but is it really ? Also the mopping seem to have been slightly improved, but I'm not sure it justifies the price.

S7 MaxV Ultra doesn't seem to be cheaper, but I didn't monitor the pricing that much recently."
"What are the chances they ad the security camera feature back?I don’t get why they would give up a manual controller for the S8 pro ultra without having a camera feed. Worried about security? Secure your networks for one and two your not that special 😂 

Jokes aside the camera is a nice security tool as if you can view the camera as a way to check the house if you think a break in has happens it great and the only reason I can see why the S7 would be better than the S8 but the S8 at least in my opinion is the better product

I’m hoping they add it via programming and maybe make it a toggle that can be flipped on or off after a password"

"Dock cleaning help S7I’m trying to clean out my S7 auto empty dock due to massive amounts of dog hair clogging it up. I’ve emptied the dustbin inside the vacuum manually (it was chock full) and removed the waste bag, which wasn’t full but had dog hair jammed into the connecting point between the dock and the bag. I’ve pulled out the dog hair stuck where the dustbin empties into the bag, but I feel like there’s more in the air chute (don’t know what it’s called). How can I clean that area? I tried pulling the whole right side from the dock off, but in only lifts out about an inch. Does this part detach for cleaning? I feel positive there is more hair jammed in there. I cleaned the air duct under the dock the other day as well. I can see there is nothing visible from the bottom."

"2 Brand new S8 pro Ultra won't even turn onEdit: Got it to work. 

TLDR: just needed to flip the way you put it into the docking station. 

Apparently it charges via the front of the Robot rather than the back(where the water drainage is. So basically the Robot dock itself, drain, clean the mops and then gets out, reverse and gets back with the front. What confused me was my other brand(Ecovac Deebot) did it in a different way so I assumed its the same here. 

Hope this helps others who are looking for this solution. 

p.s - The instruction are not clear enough on this. 

  


Hi.

I live in Europe and ordered the new S8 Pro Ultra after moving from the Deebot about 2 weeks ago.It arrived and won't turn on.

Contacted support and they said to put it inside the (plugged in) station to see what happens- nothing did. They said it's defected and need to return it to get a new one.

Order, waited and just received a new one with the same issue.

It won't turn on, won't react in the station, and im just frustrated I didn't even get the refund yet for the first one..

Am I doing something wrong or there is a solution?

Thank you for the help <3"

"Mold in S7 Maxv unit tank- More questionsOk, I have searched the sub and read all of the posts about mold growth….any help with the below would be super appreciated.

**Background**: 

I religiously clean my robot and the dock. 

I empty dirty water and clean the bin with vinegar and dish soap immediately after a run. 

I use the Roborock cleaning fluid, and empty water left in the clean water bin. 

I clean the robot very thoroughly about once a month. 

However, I did not think about the water sitting in the actual robot’s tank. So I took that out and it’s full of mold. 

**Questions:**

Is there an easier way than shaking it to get the moldy water out?

Support said to add citric acid and shake the water. Does this work?

I’d rather just buy a new tank, but Roborock is sold out. Has anyone found one for my model from another seller that will work?

How do I access the dock interior to clean the tubing?

The drying module, does this prevent mold growth in the dock‘s mop cleaning area? I’m not worried about the mop pad because I take it off after each use."

So I’ve owned it for 3 days now and there seems to be a weird noise coming from it that i cant put my finger to what it is. I’ve tried looking up other videos showing their s8’s running and they dont produce the same sound. Its sort of a buzzing noise from the engine.

"Roborock S7 maxv or S8?I have narrowed down my search for a robot vaccum to two options -

- The S7 Max v (plus?)
- The S8 without auto empty dock

I know the s7 maxv has improved ai compared to the regular s7, I was wondering if it has enough features and power to beat the regular s8 without a cleaning dock.... The main feature that the s8 has over the s7 (other than suction and the dual blade brush) is probably the improved mopping... is it worth getting it over the s7 max v? I have mostly hardwood floors but with a big rug in my living room... vibrant rise would be helpful.


Thanks."
"Do they not sell the s7 maxv's ultra dock separately?I wanted to buy the vacuum but wanted to split up the cost of it by buying the vacuum by itself, then a couple months down the line buy the ultra docking station for it.

"Dust bin. Automated emptying does not workUnfortunately, my roborock s8 pro ultra does not empty its dust bin. 

I have it brand new and I have the feeling that it does not empty at all. The dust bag seems to be completely empty and I had to empty the dust bin manually.

Actually it’s degrading.

Even though it can run over it perfectly when transitioning between rooms.

I have threshhold rampw, but they don’t help anymore. How the hell do you people deal with this when having higher threshholds?"

"How to tell it which map it's onWe have three maps saved, because the robot can't physically travel between some of our rooms so we have to move it.

Whenever I want to vacuum one of the two rooms it can't get to, I carry it over the threshold and change maps in the app to the correct room/map before I make it start cleaning.

It then goes into detecting location mode and starts vacuuming, but then I look in the app it thinks it's in one of the rooms in the main map.

PS: To get to it I have to first do a ""pin and go"" from dock as the dock is under our couch and I can't reach that far. Does that perhaps confuse it?"

"Tight Q5 brush on S7 MaxV update - genuine works!So after my recent post/video regarding the tight fit of the Q5 brush on my S7 MaxV, after some helpful comments asking if it was a genuine brush or not (it wasn't genuine), I went ahead and ordered what I hoped was a genuine Q5 brush on AliExpress.

I received the brush today that came in an official looking box (compared to the blank box the other one came in) and I tested it out.

It fits way better! No issues at all, and I'm loving what seems to be better pickup of pet hair and lint from my carpets.

The video shows how the brush fits and spins just fine compared to what you can see in my other video, and also the only real difference I can tell from the non genuine one; the little end bearing is removable. (There is also a very slight colour difference, and the bristles feel softer on the genuine brush)

So made the mistake of swapping out original filter with an unofficial one for my s7. Now when it tries vacuum excessive dog hair it tends to leave it clumped on the tile floor.

"Roborock S8 Pro ultra - Questions - Should I return?Hey guys,

my S8 pro ultra is rolling through my apartment and I love it. However there are some questions that i currently have and I am thinking about returning him already.

If someone would take the time to **help me**, I would be really grateful. I was really looking forward to the S8, but am a bit disappointed at the moment.

1. When the robot drives over the ramp to the station, it cracks a little. Is that the same for you? I would have thought that at this price there would not be such a noticeable noise. Also he is not standing in 100% accurate but a bit to the side (see the next picture). That is however not a problem for me.

https://preview.redd.it/ky3kizudqdya1.jpg?width=2620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d379697bc6836d070e85f805e47410244c86177e

2. And then please take a look at the picture below. He is cleaning (vacuuming and wiping) the blue room. The gray room is a room where the robot is only allowed to vacuum, so I explicitly did not let it wipe. Nevertheless, it wipes a small part of the room because it minimally crosses the boundary of the room when wiping. Do you have any idea what this could be?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mavhjwkgqdya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9344b7089a4b0cf4995154acf7c39355c9a232f5

3. I come from a Roborock S5 (S50, not S5 Max) and have some carpets in the flat that the S5 gets on without any problem and cleans them reasonably well. The new robot sometimes can't get on top of them and pushes them in front of it, creating a wave and getting stuck. Is the new robot too low/too heavy or can something be done about itNext to that I have a few **general questions**:

4. I can add furniture in the app. What is the advantage of this? I originally thought that the robot would even do this automatically, but it doesn't.

5.  I have the feeling that it doesn't suck as cleanly in the grout lines of the tiles as the S5 did. Could this be related to the fact that the S5 didn't have a rubber brush yet?

6. In wipe only mode, I take the highest intensity and the tightest lanes. Nevertheless, the tiles are at most mist-damp. Is this also the case for you or can you somehow increase the amount of water?

"From the iRobot S9+ and mop combo to the Roborock S8 Pro UltraI was a long time owner of the S9+ paired with the Braava Met mop. The vacuum was generally great in terms of power while the mop was horrible. 

I'm only a day in with my S8 Pro Ultra and have had it vacuum and mop my entire first floor, but I can already say that iRobot is really far behind in terms of technology. 

The first thing I noticed was with the mapping. Our first floor is about 1,800 sqft, mostly open concept, but with the master bed/bath , two additional bedrooms, a bathroom, and a laundry room. The mapping took about 30 minutes (maybe less and I think I'm being conservative) and was very accurate. In fact, the map looked more true to my house than the iRobot ever did. 

In terms of navigation, the S8 seems way more advanced such as by detecting and avoiding things like dog toys, or shoes, and pinning them on my map. The iRobot would just run over anything in its way, including dog shat. 

The app for the Roborock has much more to it. I like that it shows the life expectancy of various parts such as the air filter. I also like that it tracks the robot in real time. The iRobot app is just... Too basic for what I like. 

The mopping is night and day, with the Roborock clearly winning. The vibrating mop makes a world of difference, and also because of the self cleaning of the mop pad. 

In terms of vacuuming, the jury is out and I'd need to see it in action more to compare it to the iRobot. I can say that the results did look pretty darned good today. I'm hoping these results are the status quo. 

I'm super happy with my purchase at day 1 and happy I decided to try another platform outside of iRobot. It really feels like the future is this."

I plan on using a small amount of bissel floor cleaner to help with smells. Are there any other tips or tricks? Do you have links to which third party replacement parts you use?"

"Roborock S7 setting HELPIs here someone who knows a solution for this:  
I have a big carpet and I don't want my Roborock S7 to clean it at all.  
However, he needs to move over to carpet to reache the docking station so I cannot set a no-go zone.  
The only solution I have found is to set avoid carpet and remove the mopping plate before homing the robot. This is quite inconvenient. Is there a feature to allow entering carpets but not vacuum them?"

"S8 or S8 plus - dock questionSo im deciding which one to go for. I do have the s5 today and the dustbin on s5 is even bigger than the base model s8, so im considering the s8 plus. Although i’ve heard of robovacum docks that it sometimes fails to suck up all the dust from the bin and it falls on to the floor or of the dock. Anyone with s8 plus that experienced this problem?

Also wondering if the s8 plus dustbin get full mid cleaning, does it pause the session and go to the dock automatically?

How is the design also on s8 if you wanna empty the dustbin manually? Easy to open?

Sorry for alot of questions its just alot of money so wanna make a good decision. S8 ultra is not an option, i mop manually."
"Help! My Roborock has suddenly started running into walls and getting stuck on everything.S5 Max purchased new one year ago, it’s worked perfectly up until now.
I moved to a brand new home, deleted the old map and then did a remap and clean (which went perfectly). 

Immediately after this perfect run it just started running into walls and getting stuck. It even got stuck on its own dock.

Since then I’ve done everything I can think of:
-Updated the firmware.
-Cleaned the sensors four times.
-Replaced the filter, spinning brush, turbo head, and mopping cloth.
-Factory reseted the Roborock.
-Deleted and re-downloaded the app. 

What the hell do I do now?"

"Roborock S5 can't handle stair anymoreDon't know what has happened but my Roborock S5 keeps ""falling of the stairs"" now. The sensors are clear and nothing in the stairs has changed (lighting is also the same). The S5 will notice the stairs but kind of ""too late"" and it'll rotate itself to the left to avoid falling only to drop it's right wheel off the stairs and getting stuck. Tried putting black electrical tape to the starts of the stairs but that didn't help,   


This is a bit irritating because the S5 is used in both floors of the house regularly and I cannot use the ""no-go-zone"" on the map either because the floormap changes in between.  


Any suggestions?"
"Help creating additional mapsSo I have most of my house mapped out and everything went well. I setup my home as multi-level because I have a few sunk in areas the robot cannot normally get too. 

I tried creating a second map for one of these areas. Obviously I can't launch the map&clean or quick mapping because that will just start mapping the main area I've already done. So I physically placed the robot in the area and started doing a map and clean. When it finished, it tried returning to base (it can't). When it stopped I manually put the robot back in the dock. After it docked, it still thought it was in the second map area and now has a wash station positioned in the last room where it stopped. I couldn't even get my original map to load, so I deleted the office map and restored my original map. Everything is good now, but what's the best way for creating additional maps and not having the robot think the new area is now it's docking home?

"How use Google Assistant with RoborockI attempted to post this right after joining this group, but can't find it. Trying again... 

When I first set up my Q5, interestingly, with only linking it in Gooigle Assistant, I could specify a room from rooms identified in the Roborock app. For example: ""Hey Google...clean bathroom 1"" . I was surprised, it worked great. 

Then with upgrades of either assistant app, or Roborock app, that stopped working. 

So now, after relinking again in Google Assistant,  I do see Roborock in Google Assistant. But the only action I see is Start. No way to specify one of the rooms in the Roborock App to be cleaned. 

I also discovered Home Management in the Roborock app. I linked the robot to bathroom 1, but that didn't make any difference. I find no information on what that feature is for our how to set it up.

"Feeling a bit overwhelmed with all of the choices--any advice?Hi all,

&#x200B;

I've recently started looking into getting a robot vacuum and Roborock seems to be the consensus best product. But, I'm feeling overwhelmed with all of the choices and need a bit of help on which one to pick. I'm not sure if it's worth it to fork out the money for a really nice model, but I'm willing to do it if it makes the most sense. I'm currently in a studio apartment (around 800 square feet) with entirely concrete floors and no pets. However, with it being a studio, there's a ton of stuff all around (desk, couch, bed, etc.). I'd really like mopping and object avoidance--obviously, self-emptying would be nice, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price tag. Past that, I'm not really sure on which model would be best for me--the Roborock website recommends the S7+, but I'm not sure if that's excessive or not. Any advice would be appreciated!"
"Which Roborock to buy for strictly vacuuming hardwood floors in a household with pets?Looking to buy a Roborock and figuring out what would be the best choice. It will only be used for hardwood floors, but I do have pets so I would like it to be able to avoid accidents and pet toys. I will be vacuuming manually throughout the week as well, I just want  extra help with removing dust on a daily basis.

Initially looked at the S7 MaxV for object detection, but it's relatively expensive (€670) considering I am not interested in the mop feature.  An alternative would be the Q7 Max for almost halve the price (€380) but it does not have object detection.

Is there a better option, with object-detection for my use case? And if I were to let go of object detection, is there a vacuum-only model that I should consider?"

"Dog Pee Accident with Roborock Q5+I'm devastated. I bought the Q5+ three weeks ago and it's been working perfectly and I really love it. A few days ago my dog peed in the house without us noticing it and the Q5+ vacuumed it up and completed the clean so it also got sucked up into the docking station. I've tried to clean what I can and as far as I can tell it didn't destroy the vacuum cleaner but I'm very worried that it's going to smell like pee everytime it runs now. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone run into this problem before and do you have any cleaning solutions? Alternatively, does anyone have a good video/instructions on how to disassemble a Q5+ model? I found a Q7 disassembly video but it seems to be different enough from the Q5+ that I can't figure out how to full take it apart without worrying that I'm going to break it. Or maybe I could have it vacuum some kind of deodorizing powder to neutralize the smell?

"Roborock Q7 Max+ vs S7 Pro Ultra?I'm looking to get a robot vacuum to help keep my home clean (no carpets currently) and found that the Roborock Q7 Max+ is on sale for about £400 (albeit currently out of stock) which seems like a bargain for what I've heard is a very good robot vacuum.

For me, efficient navigation, good vacuuming and a self emptying docks are essentials. I wasn't originally looking for a robot that also does mopping, but it might be something that's good to have.

The Roborock S7 Pro Ultra £900, so a fair bit more! Do you think the added features/upgrades are worth it for that big of a price difference?

What’s the point of dustbin emptying without mop cleaning?This may seem like a stupid question - but it’s a genuine one! I can see the 2 extremes - get a cheaper device where you empty the bin and dry/clean/refill the mop yourself vs have it all entirely automated. But why have the in between version? Ie why pay have the dustbin emptied automatically if you still have to do the mop maintenance yourself? Surely empty the bin isn’t much more to do if you’re remembering to sort out the mop already?

\- When I set it up the instructions say make sure you hear the click when you connect the decking tray.  No matter what I do I don't hear a click. I am afraid any more pressure will break the tray.  It seems to be on but not sure if not clicking it in will affect anything.

\- I connected it to my wifi and can see it in the app.  I placed it on the dock and it let me know it was charging and it now shows fully charged in the app, but the light on the front of the docking station still shows red.  When I look at the quick set guide this shows red it charging error. I haven't added water yet.  Does anyone know anything about this?

\-I am about to try to map for the first time.  I have a 1700 sq foot one story house.  Do I just have to set it to map and it will just go through the full house, or do I have to ""guide"" it room to room?  Approx. how much time will it take to fully map the first time?

Thanks for anyone's help.  I am kind of disappointed in the lack of detailed instructions included in the box and on Roborock's website, especially for such an expensive product.  When I looked on their site for tutorial videos there doesn't seem to be any for the S8 at all. I have tried independent youtube videos but I can't find any that address these questions.

"Battery / motherboard question and replacement options: helpSo after 15 months, Mr. Belvedere (my S7) finally scooped up poop. Out dog had an overnight accident and it was all over the vac.

After opening and removing the undercarriage cover and cleaning, I quickly realized that the battery is unsecure and just falls out of place when turned upsidedown. When this happened, the solder on the motherboard gave out and ripped the battery PCI right off the board.

I don't know enough about motherboards to know if this could be soldered back together, but I figured it may be easier to buy and replace the motherboard.

Does anyone have experience replacing the board? I know RR coats their electronic board & parts to prevent corrosion and would hate to buy one that's not original quality. Also, are there any specific steps that have to be taken to get the app integration or WiFi set up, or should the board be plug-and-play?

Finally, anyone know how much Roborock charges to replace a motherboard, should decide to send it in?

"S6 Map not loadingI've had the S6 for a couple of years now and never really had any problems yet. I'm using it via the `Mi Home` app. 2-3 days ago it stopped loading the map only showing a loading indicator and `Network slow. Please wait.`. I still can control the robot but manual room/area selection is not possible due to the missing map.

I suspect this being a server issue since everything on my network is working flawlessly, and I still can control the vacuum.

Yesterday, rebooting the robot resolved the issue but today, again, this workaround does not work anymore.

&#x200B;

**Things I already checked:**

* 2.4 GHz Wifi enabled and connected.
* No firewall rules blocking any mi related stuff. (Turning off firewall completely didn't help either)
* Robot is placed well in range of the Wifi (-50 dBm)
* Restarted Robot
* Restarted Network
* Uninstalled and Reinstalled Mi Home app
* Clear Cache of Mi Home app
* Tried using mobile data (4G/LTE)
* Resetting Wifi on the robot.

&#x200B;

>Oh and I'm based in Europe using the European server.

&#x200B;

I want to avoid resetting the whole robot since I have a lot of fine tuned no-go and no-mop zones which I don't want to setup again.

Has anyone else had this problem recently?

**Update (2023-04-03):**

**Since yesterday the map loads fine again without any changes. So this most likely was a server issue.**

**Update (2023-04-29):**

**After a couple of days the issue appeared and went away constantly.**

**As** u/Shot-Lettuce-3656 **mentioned below when using the Home Assistant plugin ""Map Extractor"" you might run into being rate limited by the Roborock API. Turning off the reloading of the map when the vacuum is docked and not in use resolved the issue for now.**

"Let's talk about cleaning the dirty water tank 😅Hi everyone 👋

I've been using the Roborock S7 Pro Ultra for few months now and it is a truly fantastic ally on a daily basis. 

The only challenge I face is cleaning the 2 water tanks (dirty water tank + clean water tank).  
I'm using the OMO cleaning solution from Roborock even if I'm not really sure it does a difference to be honest. 🫠

The dirty water tank starts to look more and more like the bottom of a pond. I mean, no algaes and stuff, but it just look slightly gross on the overall and smell bad (I know it's dirty water!). Plus this extra small viscous layer of dirt covering the whole thing inside added with little floating of *whateveritiscalled*... it just feels like a bacteria party 🦠🎉

I saw some people using white vinegar to clean, some saying no don't do it you're going to ruin the rubbers. Another spoke about OdoBan stuff. On my side, I rinse several time the 2 tanks each cycle, use distilled water to fill the clean water tank.

So, what's your experience? How do you keep the dirty water tank reasonably clean over time? :)   
A shot at the high pressure machine (just kidding). Some touch of bicarbonate? A plash of citric acid cleaning bath? please... help me end this bacteria party once and for all 🎯

Thanks in advance 🙏"
"Roborock Application is very limited and needs workJust got the S8, my first robot ever, and I think that for something that cost my kidney, it would clean a bit better. 

1. It does not reach tight corners
2. The mop misses a lot of areas that it should be able to reach, I can't figure out why. 
3. The detergent cost 40$ (unless anyone has found a good alternative? I'm in Australia)

But most importantly, I find the app's functionality is limited:

1. **It does not allow for the removal of rooms**. This becomes problematic when the app mistakes object such as wall mirrors for rooms. While the technology may have its limitations, users should be able to remove these rooms to avoid confusion.
2. A significant issue arises when the robot encounters a 3-inch step leading into the bathroom. While this is understandable, when moved to the bathroom, the robot gets completely disoriented due to the similarities between the two bathrooms. It would be helpful if the app had a feature that allowed users to pin the robot to an approximate location, to avoid the robot getting ""lost"".
3. We should be able to get ALL the notifications, or some of them at least on the phone, every time it speaks. When I launch the robot while outside the apartment, I need to know exactly all the issues and what it says.
4. Perhaps again due to technical limitations, but it would be good to access the camera to see what it sees. 

&#x200B;

I think the robot does a pretty good job, but again for a technology that costs $1,000+, it does require a bit of work in the app."
"S7 maxv ultra or S7 pro ultraHello,

I need help deciding between the s7 max v ultra and s7 pro ultra.
I'm a student living with my boyfriend in a flat, we have a small dog. We've been wanting tl get a robot for a while now since our house has whitish tiles that get dirty really quickly.

At first, we were definitely going for the s7 max V ultra, but since our budget is tight it definitely has to be second anded. Unfortunately, we've been looking for one for weeks already, to no avail. 

We stumbled upon a new pro ultra at 850 euros and we don't know if we should take it (the max v costs 1300 euros new). On one hand, we're really tired of waiting and a robot would definitely help, though on the other hand I'm not sure if it's worth it. 

I know that it doesn't have the camera and therefore the AI, but don't mind that too much as our house is tidy most of the times. I also know that the dryer module needs to be manually activated. 

Should we take the s7 pro ultra for much cheaper than the s7 max v ultra, or should we keep waiting for even longer ?
Is there a lot of difference in terms of efficiency ? Is the s7 pro ultra worth it ?

I feel like there aren't that many differences but I'm afraid I might be missing something.


Thank you"
"Getting 8s pro when It releases. Any other products you can recommend?As the title says. I’m sold. Going to be moving in a new home in the next few weeks and will be buying the new s8 pro. We are moving from a 2 bedroom apartment to a fairly large home 4500 sq feet. We have a Dyson Vacum (not sure the model) that we love using. We have a 1 yr old and a black pit/lab mix. So having the roborock clean daily after them will be a huge help to us. 

Are there any other QOL items you use and can’t imagine being without?"

"Questions Before Buying an S7 MaxV Ultra - Please Help Me Out!Quite a lot of questions, but hopefully a few people can take a few minutes to give me a hand, I would really appreciate it!

This will be my first venture into robot vacuums, having a tough time deciding between this and the Ecovacs Omni (mainly because of the heated dry on the Omni and cleaner dock), but think I'm going with the RR S7 due to performance and removable water tank on the vacuum.

This is a money is no object purchase for us, so I'm just trying to get the best. 

We have a 2 story house, bottom floor is where this will be docked. Kitchen/dining is all tile, living room is wood floor and family room is all carpet. 2nd floor is all carpet, but for the restrooms being tile. 

My questions, please help me out: 

1. How does mopping work, do I just leave the pad on all the time? One of the ""cons"" of the Omni is that you have to flip it over and take the pads on and off, how is this not the case with the RR? 
2. If you're vacuuming and mopping at the same time, even if the vacuum is at the front, wouldn't some moisture get into the dust bin the vacuum uses and get super gross? 
3. Over time, does the vacuum roller get gross from the moisture from mopping? Obviously, maintenance, but just wondering if you vacuum and mop daily, does this become more of a problem?
4. I watched a video where this thing is super loud when going over grout lines on tile due to the hard plastic wheels, is this always the case? We have two little ones and were hoping to run it at night since the normal operating noise isn't too much louder than a dishwasher, but if its going to sound like something fell every 3 seconds, that's just insane (does the Omni have rubber wheels to not have this problem?)!
5. Living room with wood floor has one of those kids rubber play mats, about the size of a normal area rug. It has lowered edges so I would assume the vacuum can get on it. Can I have the RR S7 mop it or will it just think its a carpet and only vacuum? 
6. Using it upstairs with no dock - Vacuuming seems easy, just put it up there, let it orient itself and boom. But how would I prep it to allow it to mop the 2 bathrooms? Is there a way to force it to fill itself with the clean water and then tell me to take it upstairs and then also let me know when I need to take it back to the dock to empty the dirty water? Or do I really have to take the entire dock upstairs? 
7. Lastly, I saw mention that some people recommend replacing the vacuum brush roller with an older model one because the plastic brush roller sucks, but in reviews, the plastic performed better than the hybrids of the Omni, etc. Thoughts if this is necessary? 

Thank you all for your help, hoping to pull the trigger on the purchase today so I can get it this week!"

New Ikea rug confusing S4I just got this large room sized rug at IKEA super excited to get rid of an old shag rug that I had to keep as a no-go zone. And now apparently these gray lines keep causing Error 8 clear obstacle. Turning on bright lights in the room helped for a few lines and then it got wacky again trapped in its invisible box. I’m guessing it’s the fall sensors. Anything I can do to get this to work? Are the newer models smarter than a gray line? I now have a 2 story house so I would consider repurposing to the bedrooms if I knew that a newer model can handle this apparently difficult rug pattern.

"Roborock S7 Pro Ultra - mop raise stoppt workingHi all,

I have a S7 Pro Ultra since the release and are still happy with it but now it has few issues while cleaning.
Few days ago the S7 started randomly with rattling noises in all modes and at all directions while driving. I contacted the support but got the default steps with checking if there is dirt or anything else what could cause the noise.
Since this morning the mop is always at the top position and will not be lowered to mop the floor also if I select mopping only. 

Do you know, if there is an option to lower the mop manually or test the lower / raise function?
Would be helpful to be able to mop the floor because of our dog 😄"

Today i removed it and did a wipe down, which I’ve been doing with filter in before.  Under where that filter goes was four paper towels of pure black sludge. That was the cause. It was invisible to the eye.

"""Empty Wash Fill Dock"" message when dockedWe have the S7 Max V Ultra robot, and the past few times after cleaning, Eddie goes to his dock, and then there's a message if you tap on him that says ""Empty Wash Fill Dock."" I don't remember seeing this previously. I thought it used to say ""Charging"" if you tapped on him in the app when he was docked.

The light is not red to alert us to empty the fill tank, clean water tank, or dust bag. I have cleaned each out, reinserted them, and changed out the dust bag. There are also no alerts to do any maintenance. Is this the standard message, and maybe I didn't notice before? We've only had him for a little over a month. 

Any help appreciated! Thank you!"
"Can't connect brand new S7 MaxV Ultra to WiFi?UPDATE: tried using my husbands android phone and bingo, connected no issues! Annoying that is is on his phone though……

Hi there

I've just purchased an S7 Max V Ultra today and I am trying (and failing!) to connect it to the wifi via the Roborock app.

My first issue is that the S7 MaxV Ultra doesn't show up as a compatible device on the app (which I have literally downloaded and installed this afternoon so I'm assuming is the latest version) - my choices are S7 MaxV or S7 Pro Ultra.  I have tried connecting with both of these options  - although more often with the S7 MaxV - and still no luck.  


When I have tried to connect via either option, I have:  
\- made sure I have selected my router's 2.4ghz option  
\- checked & rechecked the router password  
\- the phone, device and router are in the same space (device is 3m away from the router in the same room with direct line of sight)  
\- turned off my phone's cellular data so it's not switching to that

I haven't uninstalled & reinstalled the app considering I have only downloaded it for the first time in the last two hours.  


any other hints/advice/help would be gratefully received! I have attached a couple of screenshots of a) the device options and b) the error message I'm getting.  


Oh in case it's relevant, I'm in Australia.  


Thanks for reading!!

Q5 not working correctly
"Roborock doesnt care about customers in Europe.I bought my S7 Maxv Ultra a year ago and bought the stupid OMO roborock approved cleaning solution. It didnt really clean well, but I used it anyways. I paid a whopping 30 € (32$) for it. Iirc a 750ml bottle of cleaning solution. In itself ridicilous. When I look at the prices in the USA it's somewhat reasonable by comparison.

When asking roborock via support why it has to be this specific cleaning solution and cant be anything else and if they could provide me with a list of things that arent allowed to be in a cleaner to be okay with the system, they basically ignored my question.

Now that my cleaning solution is empty I tried to buy new one via aliexpress (it doesnt get sold here a anywhere. Not at Shops, not via the Internet), because I also bought the first batch via that. Just so you know I bought the first bottle via a link provided by the roborock support.

Problem being, the listing from back then isnt up anymore, so I asked them again where to buy so it's not fake or smth and they sent me a link. The seller asks an even more ridicilous 45 € (48$) for one bottle and doesnt even ship to my country.

I told the support that and they havent answered me anymore.

Im honestly disappointed. I paid 1400€ (1500$) for this thing and I expected to get at least a basic level of support.

Ive been just spraying cleaning solution on the floor when he does it, since that doesnt introduce any cleaner into the fresh water circuit and supposedly doesnt destroy anything. But honestly, that's not what I bought the machine for. If I wanted to be involved myself I wouldve just done it myself. 

I also dont understand why they arent giving the ppl in Europe this Module that just gets connected with ur normal fresh water and used water circuits so u dont have to change the water at all. Just in China and according to Support a couple of months ago also wont come to Europe.. 

If you got any tips to help me out, go ahead. Im just disappointed."

"Comparison - Roborock S8 Pro Ultra vs Roborock S7 MaxV UltraHere is a comparison of the S8 Pro Ultra vs S7 MaxV Ultra

The S8 Pro Ultra has a lot of upgrades from the S7 MaxV.

-The New DuoRoller Riser is a nice addition. Not only can the robot mop only, it can also absorb liquids since there is no roller blocking liquids away! Also, the agitation is better.
-The Dock is definitely more stylish for some. I also appreciate the color choices.
-The suction increase is nice, but probably won’t do much to improve cleaning. The dual brushes should do the trick!
-VibraRise 2.0 is also a nice upgrade. While it doesn’t rise that much (still), the added bar makes for better cleanup.

There are definitely some tiny upgrades, like faster mapping and no go zone suggestions, that may apply to previous models.

Despite these upgrades, there are unfortunately some downgrades.

-Not only did Roborock decide to go down Dreame’s and Ecovacs’ path of an internal water tank, but they also went a step too far by making the mopping plate internal as well! I just don’t understand the logic behind internal components! Why make it internal? At least the water tank is still 200 mL!

-The Reactive 3D is a slight downgrade, even if it performs as well as the S7 MaxV Ultra. The cameras are black and white only, and the lasers and infrared are used to shine the object and recognize it. Theoretically, the obstacle avoidance would be worse, but further testing must be done. But even if it performs just as well, the downside to a black and white camera is that there will not be any video chatting. And it isn’t like there is peace of mind, a camera is still roaming around the house! This is an unfortunate change.

-And then there is the price. At 200 dollars more than the S7 MaxV, this robot may not be worth it.

So which one is right for you?

Get the S7 MaxV if you have pets and your floors are mostly hard wood. The S7 MaxV will do a good enough job at cleaning your hard floors, and you can check up on your pets as well! The S7 MaxV is okay for carpets, but it will have trouble with pet fur. Also get the S7 MaxV Ultra if you value durability over anything.

Get the S8 Pro Ultra if you have pets and/or your floors are mainly carpets or half carpet half hard floors. The S8 Pro Ultra will do a much better job cleaning carpets. Also get the S8 Pro Ultra if you are more concerned with privacy. While there is still a camera, at least it is black and white, so if you are concerned that your robot is taking pictures, rest assure that not all details will be present.

Hope this helps!"
"S8 Navigation IssuesS8+ set for reactive obstacle avoidance and Less collision mode but still doing some weird stuff. For example, even driving down a mapped hallway, instead of just smoothly driving along the edge of the wall like my S5 did, it veers right and constantly taps the wall having to then turn and straighten out. Like every 4 inches. Seems it should be able to just drive next to it without bumping. But it is capable of driving straight not along that wall. Like in open spaces.

First robot with obstacle avoidance. But it seems finicky. it thinks it randomly sees things in the middle of the open floor and attempts to go around them then marks them as cones on the map. I've cleaned the front sensor window things. I also understand it's not great at detecting small things like cables, but I thought it would be able to detect a tight, thick clump of a rats nest of cables. But it doesn't, it just runs into it over and over. Sometimes gets stuck and needs help, other times can get out of it. I don't usually have a clump of cables laying on the floor, but after noticing it having issues the time the cables were there, I decided to leave them to see if the bots behavior would adapt. It doesn't seem to.

Is my bot acting as expected or could my front sensors be goofed or something?"

Has anyone done this type of test?  The thickest dirt he managed to suck everything up, but the finer particles were still left behind.

"Roborock S7 MAXV Ultra drain kit Chinese version. WORKING IN THE USA!Hello all,

I just wanted to provide input for US users of the MAXV ultra since I couldn't find many people trying to run the drain kit on 110v US voltage. It works with a simple 220v to 110v plug converter that they will include with the dryer from AliExpress. You don't need a voltage converter. It's dual voltage!

&#x200B;

**A couple of lessons learned here:**

1. Make sure you remove the rubber plugs (duh, lol!). It will seem like it's working, but it will clean it without water and won't drain.
2. Depending on your drain setup, you should only need 1/2 to 1/2 male connectors and use 2 1/2 inch to 3/8 faucet connectors. In my case, my faucet has the 3/8 connector attached, so I had to use a 1/2 female to 3/8 shutoff valve.
3. It calls for the check valve to be placed up top, but I placed mine at the entrance of the main drain pipe to avoid backflow issues. It works fine.
4. Snappy traps from Homedepot make this job more manageable. It has a drain for a garbage disposal drain that can be cut to fit the 3/8 drain pipe without issue. I added some self-adhering sealant tape around it for added leak safety.

Here is what I purchased:

1. Dry kit here: [https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804558176720.html?spm=a2g0o.order\_detail.order\_detail\_item.5.4a6cf19cqHyVlz&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&\_randl\_shipto=US](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804558176720.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.5.4a6cf19cqHyVlz&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&_randl_shipto=US)

I suspect that resetting the wifi is broken on my device: I push the two buttons and the voice command tells me it is resetting the wifi, but then nothing happens. I understood that the wifi indicator is supposed to start blinking, but it doesn't. And the robo will not react to the QR code with the network settings I am presenting it.

I tried multiple factory resets so far and turning if off and on again, but the robo does not seem to be willing to check for new wifi settings...

Any ideas?

PS When the robo is turned off and I briefly press the power button, then the wifi led turns blue for a moment, so the led itself is fine.

Update: I sometimes manage to get the robo into pairing mode (not deterministically, but I think chances are higher if it rested some time on the base station), but the only difference is that the wifi indicator starts blinking. Apart from that no progress, i.e. no reaction to the QR code nor do I see the ""roborock-vacuum-..."" network"
"Can S7/S7 MaxV climb over this threshold?Hey,

I'm very interested to get S7 or S7 MaxV, but I have 1 question.

My apartment is over 50 years old building so threshold is higher than average - Highest point is around 3,5 cm. I added 3 pictures, as you can see. 

https://preview.redd.it/i2hvtl952lja1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e8e161e93cbe67f0b2cd67b5298528302c6ed51

I don't expect that any robot vacuum climb over this threshold without support. Let me know if its actually possible without support to go over threshold with 3,5 cm height.

But question is if I add ramp like this one: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/323036107174?hash=item4b3673d1a6:g:vMkAAOxyzi9Si9fj&var=513297205423](https://www.ebay.com/itm/323036107174?hash=item4b3673d1a6:g:vMkAAOxyzi9Si9fj&var=513297205423) then do you think S7/S7 MaxV will able to climb over threshold?

"Question about Dyad cleaning solutionHi guys! Is there someone using the original Roborock cleaning solution or the Omo branded one that can share experiences with the solution producing a lot of foam. Unfortunately, neither solutions are available in my country so I have to use some “Biohy” which is made for robot vacuums, but it produces so much foam (even when using half the dosage) that it gets through the filter and into the motor fan (the dirty water tank is not even half full with liquid). As a result, the fan motor is extremely rusty now and I had to treat it with WD40 to make it even spin."

"Auto empty dust binI got a second hand auto empty dock for my s7 but it didn't have the dust bin that goes inside of the vacuum. My understanding is there is a special bin  with a hole in the side to aid in sucking out everything. I think I found one on Ali express but it's going to take a month to get here and I'm looking for other options. 

Is there anything special about that bin? Is there a trap door or just a hole with a rubber gasket? If someone could post a pic that would be helpful, I'm thinking of cutting my bin."

"S7 MaxV Ultra lessons learnedFor those who are on the fence, below are some observations and tips from a week or two of use;

1) I upgraded from S6 MaxV. I did not expect much difference, just wanted the dock and I figured if I'm spending that much money I might as well upgrade to the Ultra dock. After the first few days of use, the house is noticably cleaner, commented by others. This is most likely due to the vacuum and mop feature which I ignored on the S6 maxV since it just smeared dirt around. Since the S7 can actually clean the mop and the mop head vibrates, I have actually been using the mop function with great results. I thought it was an unnecessary upgrade, but now I can wholeheartedly recommend it as well worth the money!

2) I had difficulty connecting it to my wifi. The reason was because my router has both 5 and 2.4 Ghz on the same wifi name. Most smart devices can only connect to 2.4 Ghz and get confused when the router has both under the same name. The solution is to create a 2.4 Ghz guest wifi access with a different name.

3) After the first cleaning of the roller brush, the robot could no longer wash the mop. It kept slipping on the dock and wouldn't go all the way into the mop cleaning zone. The issue turned out to be how I reassembled the roller brush. I flipped the end of the black widget at the end of the roller and assembled it backwards, and that caused the roller cover to be slightly elevated on one end. When the cover didn't immediately snap into place I should have noticed it, instead I forced it into place. It still vacuumed fine, but I may have scratched my floors since I see wear marks on that end of the cover now. My floors are too old to notice if it created any scuff marks. Once I fixed the roller, it is back to mopping like normal.

4) I ordered a drying module from Amazon. Since it was Amazon US, I assumed I would receive a US version of the drying module. Nope! What arrived was a Chinese version with Chinese only instructions and a Chinese plug. But the instructions include drawings so no need for English. And they included a universal travel plug converter which initially looked like it wouldn't match, but it worked and everything seems to be working just fine now. 

5) In the couple of weeks of use prior to the dryer module I noticed no unpleasant smells, but I never left a wet mop on the vacuum, and I generally emptied the dirty water container within 24 hrs and mostly right away. I purchased the official cleaning solution in case I needed it to minimize smells, but so far I have not felt the need to use it, water alone works just fine.

6) The mop fabric from the S6 seems to work too. It fits but maybe it won't last as long? Time will tell.

7) I have the ultra dock wedged between the wall and a tall cabinet with zero side to side clearance.This keeps it out of the way and has not interfered with the robot's ability to dock in the slightest. It does have about 5-6' of clearance in front, I think this is more important.

8) I love this thing!!!! I have had a robot vacuum since the very first Roomba about 20 years ago. This is the only one that I feel actually saves work. All the others required so much more babysitting and maintenance. I love love love the Ultra dock!!!!

9) I love this thing!!!!

10) Did I mention how much I love this thing? :)

Editing to add:

A) I have no rugs, all hardwood and tile surfaces, and 3 hairy animals. The S7 maxV is perfect for this situation but I very much doubt it would work in a household with rugs and hairy animals, getting fur off of carpet is difficult.

B) I have not had enough time to truly form a good opinion on hair tangles, but so far it is VERY promising! I've had multiple vacuums destroyed by hair tangles, to the point that one of our household is now called ""the vacuum killer"". Hair would need to be cut out of the roller brush very regularly (and usually I didn't do it often enough and the vacuum became ineffective). After a week of a mix of vacuuming and mopping with the S7maxV, no hairs were wrapped around the rubber roller, all the hair (less than usual but still significant amount) got wrapped around the end of the roller around the hard plastic core at the ends. The end pieces are removable, so it is super easy to just slide this hair off. So I consider it a huge improvement so far anyway, but I haven't had enough time to test to be sure."
"Question for roborock S7 pro or maxv ultra owners.From what I've read/seen, the unit returns to Dock to clean the pad. You have the option to set the time up to 50 minutes max.

My question is how would this work in a multi level house. If I take it upstairs and its cleaning and gets to 50 minutes, what would it do? Stop till I bring it back to the dock or does it get that it can't go back and finishes the clean?"
"S7 repair option/suggestionsHi all, 

I was looking for some guidance to help repair my S7 device that got some water/vinegar damage.

I tried replacing the battery but that didn’t help. I’ve taken it apart but don’t see anything that jumps out that needs attention. Any advice would be appreciated!"

Error 42- cleaning maintenance brush stopped working roborock s7 maxV ultra
"[Help] Considering between S7 MaxV Plus and Ultimate.I'm about to pull a trigger on a roborock and I was initially considering the ultra version, however, have been reading a lot about the stinky water and wet mop problems recently.

My area is about 810sqft (75sqm) and mostly hardwood and tiles. I like the idea that it would wash all my floors without any need for my attention but if it isn't really solving those problems with the stinky water and wet mop (means it requires manual input to empty the tank every time and dry the mop, which is about the same thing you need to do with plus) then I'm not sure it's worth spending more money on ultra.

"Which one should I buy S7+ vs S8Hi, 

maybe someone here can help me. 
I can’t decide between the S7+ (650€) or the S8 without dock (550€ in the first week). 

My budget is around the 650€ and so the s8+ will be too much with 899€ at release. 
Seems like the Release-Sale only applies on the S8 without any dock. 

I also heard that you can’t buy the dock for the s8 separate and only in bundle with the Vac… is that true? Haven’t seen an official statement yet. 

My flat is around 70 square meters, I’ve got no Pet or kids and 2 rugs (mid sized length).

"Q7 max, how to improve mopping?I recently got a Q7 max, and am not that impressed with the mopping ability. Basically it just drags a damp cloth behind it. Yes I realise I should have gotten the S7 max plus ultra super sayan for better mopping, but at the time and for the price my research showed that the Q7 mopping was still pretty good.

So far I've only really just added water to the reservoir.

It's there any way to make the mount a bit more effective? Any additional attachments or accessories?"

"S7 MaxV performance degradationHey everyone,

I have noticed lately that the cleaning (vacuuming) performance of my Roborock has decreased noticeably. It is quite obvious as I have two dogs and in the beginning it was a miracle how good that thing was.

Do you think this might be caused by the nearing end of life of the brushes or might it be something else?

"Help - which Roborock should I get with long haired cats?Hello everyone, I'd much appreciate your advice on the roborock's vacuums as I never had a robot vacuum before but I can't stand vacuuming everyday anymore.

I decided on the Roborock brand as I have some friends that have the s7 and they say it's great but I read that this model is not so good with pet hair?

Their website is not helpful either to understand the difference of their models... Our house is 100sqm and is hard floor. We have 2 rugs

What is a must:

* The robot needs to be able to vacuum long hair: I have 2 long haired cats, a British long hair and a Siberian. Their shedding is no joke.. I fill a dyson v10 every 2 days with their hair and the house is still a mess
* I really like the idea of the mop feature if this actually works ?
* No bags - I switched to dyson because of the emptying system that is so easy and doesn't require a bag. I saw that many robot vacuums need bags. I want the easiest way possible to empty the robot and not have to purchase separate parts like bags, does that exist?

The price is not really an issue if I can get one that responds to all the points above

Thank you, I really appreciate your help!!"
"My way to keep the watertank filters workingI have Roborock E5 and I have kinda struggled with the tiny foamy watertank filters that slowly let water through onto the mop, they were becoming clogged quite quickly and not letting water through. I think it is caused by hard water and everytime the water dries out, the mineral+fine dirt left in the foam slowly clog it, because after just 10-20 hours of mopping, the filters let no water through.

These things helped me to restore the water flow onto the mop to keep it wet during mopping:

1) Dont let the filters dry out. Take out the water tank after cleaning is done, remove the filters and put them into a shot glass with distilled water and keep them there until next cleaning. This way the minerals from tap water never get the chance to clog the filter.

2) Let air into the watertank during mopping. Fill the tank only 50-70% full with water and dont completely close the water intake and let it breathe a little. If the air can freely go into the water tank, no negative pressure can build up and the water flows through the filter much freely. If you dont mind voiding waranty, you can drill a small hole in the top middle part of the watertank to let the air permanently in.

3) Puncture the filters with a thick sewing needle, which will create a small opening to let water through better.

I like to have the mop more wet during mopping, and the default setup wasnt letting much water through, so the mop remained somewhat wet only right around the filters during mopping, plus the clogging was slowly cutting down the waterflow further. But with these tricks I have improved the water flow significantly."

"Roborock S7 - Mop Running DryHey all.

I have a Roborock S7 (roborock.vacuum.a15) and am having issues with the mop running dry during cleaning.

The  water tank is full of filtered water, I have applied a small amount of Vaseline to the seals on the robot side where it connects to the water tank, as well as tried blowing in to the water tank fill port until water squirts out the robot-side tube to create a prime and ensure there is no air in the tube that is stopping it.

I have also checked the water tank is not bent (as per the somewhat useless [Roborock support article](https://support.roborock.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035369712-What-should-I-do-when-there-is-little-water-leaking-from-tank-and-mopping-cloth-is-almost-dry-) \-- I don't have leaking water issues), and ensured the filters are clean.  None of this has helped.  Before each clean I manually wet the mop pad under the kitchen tap, so the first 2-3 minutes are fine, however it eventually dries up which  suggests to me the robot isn't sufficiently wetting the mop pad.

I've created a support ticket with Roborock already, but am wondering if anyone has managed to resolve this before? Seen a few similar issues reported online, and that's where the manually priming/Vaseline suggestions came from - but no dice for me.

TIA."
"S7 MaxV Ultra - short review 3 months after upgrade from S6 MaxVI'd like to post a short review - 3 months after getting S7 MaxV Ultra (with water/dust bin docking station) - maybe it will help someone

I was using S6 MaxV earlier, 100m2/1077sq ft apartment, hardwood/parquet floors + tiles

In general - S7 + Ultra washing station is great. Finally I don't have to remember about washing the mop, refilling the small tank before every session. Docking station holds enough water for moping of over 200m2, mop itself look clean after automatic washing. And mop is always wet when the session starts. All of that is resulting in much cleaner apartment - I can run it more ofthen without any preparations. Cleaning performance looks better than S6 MaxV - especially visible on tiles.

No issues in last 3 months - other than getting stuck once under the radiator.

The biggest downside: process of moving dust from vacuum to the station is loud - like normal vacuum loud. And handles on clean/dirty water buckets are badly placed, and they interfere when opening the buckets.

Conclusion: expensive, but a good product"

"Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra vs New S8 Pro UltraI've done so much research -trying to decide which Roborock is best for me. I've had the S5 Max for a few years -and love it. I have an art studio -which is a step-down from the rest of the house. This step has always been a problem and I've had to pick up the S5 and place it in the studio. Now it will just live there and vacuum only that area daily. I really want a self-empty bin and would love the mop wash feature. I purchased the S7 MaxV Ultra during Cyber Monday week for $1060 and have been holding onto it -not even opened- until the new S8 features were revealed. I can still return it up to Jan. 31st. I have a 1930's cottage with really nice original hardwood floors, tile floors in kitchen and bathrooms, a few area rugs -and a small dog.

Here are my thoughts -and what I think might be best for me: I like all of the features on the S7 MaxV Ultra -and I can add a Q5 brush roller ($18) which is possibly safer for hardwood & better carpet/rug cleaning (but more brush maintenance) and the dryer module if needed -which is $99 when available. Not sure if I'd even need this. I can also use a small inexpensive fan to help with mop pad drying -or simply remove the pad and let it air-dry after mopping. I also like the option of the remote video camera even if I rarely use it. This feature is not available on the S8 Pro Ultra. It may be added later with a MaxV version, but would add even more expense to an already pricey item. One of my concerns with the brand new model with dual rubber rollers and greater suction is that it might scratch my original hardwood floors -like the Roomba s9 & i7 have been shown to do (you can find a video on YouTube testing the Roomba on plexiglass). You can reduce the likelihood by regular thorough cleaning of any dirt embedded in the rubber rollers (which adds a lot more maintenance). The S7 MaxV has the rubber roller as well- but can be replaced with a brush roller from the Q5. I don't know of a possible replacement for the dual rubber rollers since this is a brand new feature.

I really like the look of the new black & white S8 Pro Ultra -since my 1930's cottage has a black and white kitchen and checkered tile floor. That color option is not available for the S7 MaxV Ultra here in the US. I've decided I could always customize the S7 MaxV Ultra with white vinyl if I really want that aesthetic -which could be a fun project -and would still allow you to see water levels. (I've attached a mock-up of what I might do.)

There are a lot of options/decisions -and a lot of $$$ in order to have a cleaner home without doing all of the work ourselves ;) and I'd love to hear what some of you have decided to do -and what you think of my conclusions.

"Roborock failed send messageHi, i know there is already a thread, but it's old and I tried to connect the Roborock with a guest network as suggested, but it won't work.
In the installation process there will pop up a message telling me

""Failed to send message""

I even bought a new router Fritzbox 6690 which is pretty pretty good, but it won't connect either.

Please help. I'm from Germany and the Xiaomi support is not existing.

Edit:
I really have now clue: i tried the hotspot option which someone suggested, but the Roborock couldn't find the hotspot.. so after (really) a week of trying, i tried it one more time and it worked, even i didn't change anything.

Thanks for all the help, great community. Better than any Xiaomi support team"
"Water Change Kit isn't pumping waterHi, my newly installed water change kit isn't pumping water but there's also no notification that there's a problem. It goes through the motions of wetting the mop and then it's on its way. There's also no water coming when the dock is supposed to clean the mop. It dry brushes the mop and then goes back to charging. It's plugged into the drying kit, and that works as it should. When I press the button on top it lights up white, but I don't know what that's supposed to tell me.. 

I have no idea where the issue might be and I'm hoping to get some help from someone that has the kit installed already. An electrician hooked the kit up and said when he opened the valve he could hear the water coming in but couldn't test it as I wasn't home. Is there anything I'm supposed to do with the connection to the dock?

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks"
Help me delete this living room encroachment to the guest room. Try Roborock goes to the guest room just to hit this blue streak then goes back the living room whenever I just hit clean the living room😭
"Dear Roborock, please let us slow Rocky downI've got an S7MVU and I love the thing. We've got 3 cats and they've got a large catio they hang out in most of the day so they bring in all sorts of leaves and debris. Most of the house is tile and the vacuum does a great job with fur tumbleweeds and catio debris on the tile but as most of the reviews point out the S7 MaxV's weak spot is fur on carpet. I can't really fault it because the fur clumps take my cordless dyson several passes to pick up as well but I can't help but think that if it'd just slow down on carpet it'd be a lot more effective. It's nice and slow when doing perimeters and obstacles but puts on the afterburners when it's doing its straight lines through the middle of the room. Please let us slow it down! I'd happily trade a slower clean for a more thorough job."
"S7 maxV Ultra wifi and positioning issuesDuring the recent sale I purchased an S7 maxV ultra and although the cleaning is great, it almost has never worked through a full clean (one week later). In particular, it keeps ""positioning"" and losing the wifi connection. I installed a dedicated router for it as well (a tplink Archer C7), but it keeps failing -- this has happened at least 5 times in 1 week, so almost on a daily basis.

I do think it does a good job at cleaning the floor, especially with pets around, but this is frustrating. I am checking whether a factory reset will help, but I am not optimistic. Very disappointed by the experience thus far.

EDIT: A factory reset actually made things worse! For example: I ask it to start mapping, it just stopped after 30 seconds! 

EDIT 2: I got a new router (Asus RT-RX3000) and set up an exclusive 2.4ghz for it. Factory reset, firmware update, and still stops and loses positioning after couple of minutes into mapping, 7-8 feet from the router.

EDIT 3: After a few exchanges with Roborock's e-mail support, I decided that this is not worth my time. I've started the return-refund procedure with amazon and will be buying another brand in the future."
"Roborock S5 to Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra upgrade mini-reviewLeaving behind for other people that might consider similar upgrade:

S7 MaxV - improvements over S5:

* Less loud with better noise profile (lighter on ears) - my wife no longer bans vacuuming while having headache.
* Mop actually does clean floors - S5 had static mop without water pump, it required constant refills and would not clean anything beside lightest stains. S7 MaxV will clean most of them - maybe not at first or second pass, but ultimately my kitchen floor is no longer stained.
* S7 MaxV avoids most below-LIDAR-objects.
* S7 MaxV bumps a lot less into objects.
* S5 was constantly getting stuck on dryer legs, requiring it to be supervised during cleaning. No effective cleaning was possible while being away from home. This is no longer issue with S7 MaxV.
* S5 was heavily reliant on historic data - if it detected something blocking path (like door or object on floor) it would forever avoid that area and would not clean it ever, even if on next session both LIDAR and ultrasonic sensors would clearly say there is no longer things here.

S7 MaxV - not good things:

* Still partially reliant on historic data - sometimes S7 MaxV will behave like S5 in regard to things that move, sometimes not. This really shouldn't be an issue anymore - this vacuum has cameras, LIDAR and ultrasonic sensors, and it still picks memory over data from this sensors to ""avoid"" ""obstacles"".
* Object detection doesn't work on surfaces with strong patterns, like baby mats.
* Dusk container is MUCH smaller - expect to clean it twice as often as with S5.
* S7 MaxV loses position much more often if paused during cleanup.
* S5 has dust container fill detection S7 MaxV does not. What happened here?

Ultra Dock (Empty Wash Fill):

* Dust container emptying is LOUD - TWICE AS LOUD AS VACUUM ON HIGHEST SETTINGS.
* Mop washing could be more silent, but it's on acceptable level.
* Mop washing does good job - mop is no longer smelly after week of use and waste water does contain dirt.
* At that price, drying module really should be part of this dock.
* It's not bagless, and it should.
* Settings for dock are not flexible enough - dust container can be either emptied every time vacuum dock at dock, or manually. In my home it takes few days to accumulate enough dust to fill container, so emptying it few times a day (with kid vacuum is used with zones few times a day) just burns energy and makes noise without contributing anything valuable. At current state of matter, I can either set it to do it too often or use automatic platform in manual way. Not good.

My final verdict:

* It's decent upgrade over S5.
* If you have kid or pet, pick S7 MaxV. If not, S7 makes much more sense.
* Ultra dock make sense only if you are really short on time. I upgraded to it after half of year ONLY because I have young kid and I barely have any personal time, so I'm trying to automate everything I can. Every additional 20 min recovered for are worth a lot to me. If I had more time during day for things not kid-related I wouldn't buy it, especially at current price and with current drawbacks."

"Why is the S7 status orange?I hope that somebody can help me out here. Until now it was always green when it cleans a room and suddenly it is only green when it is loading in the charging station. The manual states that orange means that there is an error. Unfortunately, I cannot find any error and I even did not find any solution searching the Internet. Do you have any idea what to do?"
"Help me - New to Roborock S7Got a new Roborock S7 yesterday and put it for vacuum and mop today. After about 90 minutes of cleaning and around 30% charge left, roborock got confused with the map. It stated navigating to an area that was already cleaned and started again, whilst its location was completely off on the app. Basically, there was a huge disparity between physical location and its mapped location. Since the job was incomplete, it did not auto-save the map. I had the option to save against the app's recommendation, nevertheless, I went ahead and saved. 

I have now marked a few areas and if I restart the job and only choose those incomplete areas, will it remap or only clean the partially mapped areas?"
"Roborock app won’t connectI used to use the roborock app but eventually it stopped working when trying to reconnect I couldn’t get it to connect to my phone but the Mi home app works fine. I tried factory reseting, deleting app, and deleting account."
Answer from Roborock regarding cleaning solutions for S7 MaxV UltraIf anybody is still wondering: I asked Roborock customer service about the two different cleaning solutions. They confirmed that both are suitable for the S7 MaxV Ultra.
"Fixing up an old E4 I got from a friend. Not many good resources for this model, so I'm doing a lot of guesswork. Found a dust bin chip not inserted into anything, aside from the wires. Could use some helping figuring out where it goes.Here's a link to front and back:

[https://technikdepot.ch/gb/dust-box-detection-card-for-roborock-e45-e55](https://technikdepot.ch/gb/dust-box-detection-card-for-roborock-e45-e55)

The only info on it I've been able to find is that there's a magnet on the dustbin which it's supposed to somehow make contact with, but I spent well over an hour unsuccessfully figuring it out.

Any help would be greatly appreciated"
"S5 Max keeps giving “internal error” message. Have cleaned all the wheels, brushes, dust trap, reset it, reset the Wi-Fi deleted, the map…still won’t work. Goes about 5 or 6 feet from the base & shuts down. Help?"
"Performance Issue ResolvedI just want to share this since others are probably experiencing this. I have an S7 MaxV and an S4 MaxV. I also have 2 dogs and one sheds year round regardless of outside temperature (Corgi). I noticed both of my vacuums weren’t picking up as much as typical. The S4 kept saying the filter is clogged or wet. Both vacuums also seemed to be working harder than before. I have an air compressor, but a can of compressed air from a box store should work as well. I used my air compressor to blow air backward through the exhaust to clear anything in there. A tuft of dog air mixed with dust flew out of the S7. First run after filled the bin. It also sounded much quieter, not working as hard. S4 isn’t griping about the filter being clogged. 
Hope it helps!"
"Check the on-robot water reservoir on your S7 Max V Ultra asap. They are disgusting.Following another post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/12dzfpl/how_to_deal_with_this_black_floatersalgie_in_s7/) I checked mine. The thing has a whole ecosystem in it and I see no good way to clean it. It's beyond gross. If anyone has found anything that works let me know. Otherwise your roborock S7 is probably spreading filthy mold water around your house whenever it mops.

Here's mine: https://imgur.com/a/R1Wi9dr

This seems like a massive design flaw and seriously weakens the value of the robot if it's a persistent problem.

EDIT: Roborock support told me to try using citric acid of hydrocholric acid. I don't have any HCL laying around and that seems very harsh, but that's their first round of advice. I tried citric aid and it accomplished nothing, as the mesh over the manual fill hole prevents the removal of the gunk.

EDIT 2: For reference, the issue is that we've got standing water in a tank, which is a recipe for mold growth. And when that growth happens, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to remove it. That is because of this guy: https://imgur.com/a/1TEUml7. The other holes on it are two small or seem to be one-way. Perhaps I am stupid, but the manual does *NOT* mention cleaning this tank at all under routine maintenance: https://support.roborock.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/5615649272345/Roborock_S7_MaxV_FCC_EN_Manual.pdf. 

Since some people asked our usage patterns:

* I always use the cleaning solution with tap water.
* I sanitize the clean and dirty basins on about a weekly basis, 
*The water basins are emptied every 2-3 days
* I have it mop the whole house nightly and therefore the water is getting refreshed often, and 
* The mop pad is replaced at least every week.
* All other routine maintenance tasks are done on schedule or well before, such cleaning as the water filer on the stand.

EDIT 3: Support said there's nothing to do if the mold cannot be removed and told me to buy a new tank. I was told this isn't under warranty, as the water tank is apparently a consumable in their view. They had no advice on how to keep the next tank from getting moldy except to use the Omo detergent, which I already use. I'll push back and see what they say, but who knows.

EDIT 4: I think I was able to eradicate most of it by soaking the tank with bleach. The stuff disintegrated pretty well. I also purged the lines of the actual unit with some bleach and water to disinfect whatever might be living in there. Hopefully this addresses it. Roborock support stopped communicating."
"Auto empty dust binI got a second hand auto empty dock for my s7 but it didn't have the dust bin that goes inside of the vacuum. My understanding is there is a special bin  with a hole in the side to aid in sucking out everything. I think I found one on Ali express but it's going to take a month to get here and I'm looking for other options. 

Is there anything special about that bin? Is there a trap door or just a hole with a rubber gasket? If someone could post a pic that would be helpful, I'm thinking of cutting my bin."
"S6 MaxV - AI Object Avoidance detect aid?do anyone know if there is anything one can add to cable or things to get even better odds that it avoids it?  


I have s6 and a s6 MaxV. and it looks like the ai detection helps a lot. but still it does get entangled in cables. sometimes I also wished that since this have cameras that one could add a dynamic avoidance. Like I have a yoga mat that it struggles a bit with. If I could have it dynamically avoid that, I wouldn't have to make a static nogo-zone, and it could be moved and still avoided."
"Roborock S6 - more efficient mop pads?Hi guys!

Would there be an (aftermarket) reusable mop with a more coarse/harder scrubbing surface (2nd language, not too sure how to put it) that kinda touches the surface more uniformally?

I feel my s6 could do a bit more of an efficient job at mopping if it applied just a bit more pressure on the surface. (Maybe putting a small 2mm shim between the water container and the body would aid for that effect?)

Thanks for any tips."
Can Roborock handle black & white rugs like this without it triggering the cliff sensors?
"Safe cleaning fluid for Roborock moppingI have been seeing a few posts recently on using some type of cleaning fluid in the mopping tank. I posted this recommendation in a response to another post but figured it could use its own post. 

I have been using the iRobot Braava Jet cleaning solution in my S5 Max and now S6 MaxV continuously since the S5 Max was released with zero ill effects. I felt that this solution was designed and tested for a similar environment as the Roborock Max system (the older drip style mops like the S5 may have different results). 

My primary concern with any solution long term was gumming/oxidation and corrosion. Both of these issues likely would of been tested for by iRobot for use in their Braava Jets. The use case is very similar, different materials and components obviously but same basic principle. It smells nice, works relatively well and appears to have some kind of drying aid. I felt the risk of damage was way lower vs using something like Bona or Mirage floor cleaner. 

4 capfuls per Roborock Max water tank is roughly the same concentration that iRobot recommends in their tanks."
"Network slow “hang”Yesterday I went to start my S5E and received a notification that the network was slow. I turned off the vacuum cleaner and turned it back on, and everything worked as expected (i.e. the map showed up and I could clean what I wanted).
Today I got the same error however a reboot has not fixed it. Reading earlier messages, I cleared the cache and I tried using my 5G connection instead of my Wi-Fi. Same issue. It sounds like this is a server side problem from Roborock. Are others experiencing this? Does anyone have a solid fix?  Honestly, the other fix of using a phone as a hotspot seems like a Band-Aid for a bigger problem. I have not tried that"
"Roborock S8 Pro Ultra ReviewI absolutely love my new S8 Pro Ultra.  I owned a horrible Roomba 20 years ago and I feel like I have gone from an iPhone 1 to iPhone 15.  I have a large 2 level house with beagles, different floor types and have a unit servicing each floor.  I plan to run them 2-3x week and be meticulous on the maintenance.  Now only time will tell if the units stay healthy.  Side topic - Anyone else thinks the OMO cleaner smells like blueberry pancakes after a room is mopped? 

Pros: 
- All the automation is seamless and no issues.  The unit just works as advertised with no intervention.  

- The App is very well constructed, great response and easy to use.  I love I can set no go zones and avoid the robot from getting stuck.  

- Vac is very good.  

- Moping is excellent.  Looks like I did it myself.  

- Siri control is awesome for adhoc single room cleaning.  I can rely on the reoccurring schedule while also calling the robot to a specific room if a mess is made.  

- Room mapping is accurate and fast 

- Avoidance is decent.  Not perfect but the unit does navigate well and does a good job of getting out of tight spots

- No issues with onboard bin transfer to the dock bin.  Our dogs shed a ton and so far no blockage.  

Cons:
- (This is more for myself and not the unit) I use a nice reverse osmosis, 4 stage water filtration to supply filtered water.  It’s faster than a distilled machine and can produce 1700ml in about 8mins.  But I do have to spend some time each week refilling the main jug.  

- As said the avoidance is decent.  I would not rely on this unit to avoid poop messes 100% of the time.  But my dogs are grown and trained so I don’t have in house mess issues.  

- I can already tell customer service is going to be a challenge.  On launch they didn’t have any S8 specified bin bags listed on the Roborock site.  The chat tech kept telling me they were not avail despite me asking several times if the S7 bin bags were identical.  Turns out they are identical and they updated their site a week later specifying the S8 also.  I have heard mixed reviews on the China support.  

- Maintenance.  As said a I plan to be meticulous here.  Seems like a full maintenance scrub will be needed monthly for all the various systems.  But this is a minor inconvenience for the automated clean floors.

- Rug/Hardwood Edge mopping is not great because of the lifted mop when transition to carpet.  Which is actually a good thing to not dampen the rugs but the edge mopping is sloppy because of this."
"Using Roborock without Saving MapsI believe many problems arise because the robot finds the actual floor layout (including orientation) different from the stored map it is asked to follow. I have been using my 3 robots for many years, clocking a total of over 615,000 sqm (6.62M sq feet) without saving maps. I recognise there are advantages in using saved maps and that this does not work for everyone but for me:

1. the faster time it takes with saved maps is not significant (maybe only 10%)
2. for no go zones, I use magnetic barrier tapes around the chairs & tables and rely on the drop sensors (I have furniture, staircases and even a indoor pond on my floors)
3. to clean specific rooms or floors, I open or close the doors accordingly.

For those of you who always encounter problems with the maps, try disabling saving of maps and compare the results. Good luck!

"Wait for S8 Pro Ultra or pull the trigger on S7 MaxV UltraWe currently have a S5 which has been an absolute work horse for many years, but we’re ready for an upgrade, but cannot for the life of us decide if we should wait for the S8 Pro Ultra or just pull the trigger on a S7 MVU. 

We live in Australia so from what I’ve seen we’d usually get new Roborock models ~6 months after the US does. 
(I might also add that I’m usually pretty impatient when it comes to new tech toys 😅.)

Our Scenario:

We have a 4 Bedroom house, majority is tiled with the exception of the bedrooms and a formal lounge room all having low pile carpets. 
There’s 2 dogs, one of which is a pug and he sheds like it’s going out of fashion, the other doesn’t sheds very little if at all.

The dilemma:

Obstacle avoidance:
I hold concerns about the S8 obstacle avoidance not having a camera but relying on some sort of 3D infrared system instead. 
Does the camera make all the difference, and will it lack object detection with no camera?
I also think that having the camera on the S7 MVU will also come in handy as a remotely drivable pet cam!

Brush System:
The dual rollers on the S8 look great, and I hear rumours that it will have really good hair pickup as well, but does the single roller on the S7 MVU still work sufficiently with hair pickup and general dust pickup? (I’d also considering doing the Q5 brush upgrade on the S7). 

Mopping System:
The dual sonic mop scrubbers looks great on the S8, but how much better are they over the S7?
Does the S7 MVU still do a decent job from peoples experiences with its single sonic scrubber?

Other minor thing:
- The drying module isn’t a huge deal to us as we can add this on later if we went the S7 route.

So should we wait for the S8 Pro Ultra or will the S7 Max V Ultra still be a great option?"
"Roborock should have the option to manually add to the object image libraryInstead of solely relying on AI and their library, you should be able to take a photo / 3D photo of unusual objects in your house that you want it to recognize. My S7 MaxV keeps running over certain cords, dog beds, and other random objects on the floor that it really shouldn’t be."
"Returning S6MaxV (multiple issues)I wanted to like this robot so badly! I did a ton of research to decide what to update my Roomba 690 to. 


reasons for returning:


1.The biggest issue is that the robot detects a electromagnetic field in the MIDDLE of my dining room and as a result refuses to clean there. Support said over email that I should return my unit even though the answer seems simple (turn off magnetic no go line detection with an app toggle). 


2 The side brush is incredibly dumb in execution. When the robot goes on my higher pile carpet the main brush works fine but the side brush always gets tangled. The robot doesn't seem to know to reverse the rotation direction of the side brush to get free like my 4 year old Roomba does...(again...simple software update). 

3.I had to put white pieces of paper tapped to all the cliff sensors just to get my robot to go up on the rug. (another thing that can be turned off with a software toggle). 

4.It relies TOO MUCH on LIDAR without doing false positive checks with the bump sensor. What I mean by this is if it accidentally goes under a drapery or shower curtain then it shuts down and yells at you in the app that it can't see. (again, simple software fix to have it try and go back to the last known position by backing up or driving forward) 


As a software engineer in the medical field this just seems lazy in programming design. Specially for the amount of iterations this company has done to get up to this model. 


I'm going to try out the Ecovac's T8 AIVI and see if that's better. Really sad though given that their unit doesn't have a IR camera.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/15/2020)

I have received my Ecovac T8+ from Bestbuy. Got it set up, fully charged, ran a whole house clean. Here are my initial thoughts in comparison to the Roborock S6MaxV below.


1. It immediately was able to overcome the area with the high electromagnetic frequency. No issues what so ever. It held it's straight line pattern and was done super quickly. 

2. It had the same issue initially as the Roborock where it refused to go up onto my higher pile carpet. I took all the white tapped paper off of my S6MaxV and taped them onto the bottom of the T8. This solved that issue just like the Roborock. I say initially because once I solved the climbing onto the carpet issue it had NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER at cleaning the high pile carpet. Now _note_ this robot has TWO side cleaning brushes and neither got stuck in the 20 minutes I ran it on my high pile carpet, amazing. I still hate having to put tape over an $800 device, but at least it doesn't get tangled once up on the carpet.

3. It cleaned up my apartment in about the same time as the Roborock but did it in a different style. It split the rooms in half and would do half a room, then leave and do another room, then come back. I was worried at first because that seems inefficient, however on completion of the map generation, it merged / separated the rooms correctly and so now I can tell it to clean a specific room. 


4. Carpet detection is amazing! I didn't have to put ANY no go lines in my place vs the Roborock where I had to put some on the carpet as well as by the night stands where cables lay around and the cat bowls. 

5. Avoided the cat bowls. Got up super close but then recognized an object in the way, backed up, and cleaned around them. The Roborock would either not get close to them on some passes or would completely shove them out of the way. (granted the cat bowls are around the area that the Roborock yells about the EMFs). 


6. Seemed to pull much more out of my medium pile carpet. I don't know if that's from the rumors of Roborock's main brush overheating management or just something else. After running it just once there was so much in the dustbin that I had to clean it out by hand because the self cleaning couldn't do it. (This is known issue with self cleaning robots that you need to run them move often to avoid clogs). I JUST ran my S6MaxV last night on that carpet so seems better in that regard. 

------ISSUES SO FAR-----------
-only issues i've had so far in the app was splitting rooms in the app. Merging was SUPER easy but the splitting algorithm seems to want splits along existing walls. For instance I wanted to isolate the area in front of the cat's litter box to a room so I can tell it to clean that area specifically. The first split of the main room was fine but the perpendicular split wouldn't take. I ended up doing an angled single split instead which get 80% of the area I had intended. Will try and get that working better though. From my research this is the biggest issue with Ecovacs. 

-Since I had taped over the cliff sensors to get onto the high pile rug, it caused an issue where the auto empty station wouldn't start up at the end of a clean even though it said it was in the app. Removing the tape covers fixed it. I guess i'll have to come up with a better solution to get it onto the high pile rug but at least i know once it gets on the rug it will be okay. 

All in all I'm much happier with the T8+ so far. It tackled my two main issues ( high pile carpet cleaning and EMF areas) which staying about 99% on par with my S6MaxV. 

I will continue to update this thread throughout the week with further updates since I have until the end of the month to send either unit back for a refund. 







-------EDIT 09/16/2020--------


THINGS I LOVE!
Okay so this was freaking awesome. I remembered reading that the new T8's 3D object detection tech is using two cross shooting IR lights with a center mounted IR sensor.


 I have security cameras in my apartment that turn on when we aren't home since my apartment has a clause in our lease that says maintenance can come in at any time due to emergencies without advanced notice, which they have before . Just helps me keep at ease. Anyway at night they switch to IR mode and I was able to check out the IR from the T8 working in real time! I would also guess that night time might be _easier_ for the robot to navigate/ see in my apartment when the cameras are on because of all the IR light they project out. 


Here is what that looks like in the camera view 
[camera picture](https://imgur.com/a/myiMKrD)
I can't be sure, but it looks to have two side IR lights as well, perpendicular to the front of the robot. The object detection still is better than the S6MaxV. It's getting closer to my cat's water and food bowl to clean but won't run into the like the Max did. The Max always pushed them off the cat mat; maybe because the bowls are too reflective, idk. 


The self empty base station is awesome. A bit loud but only runs for 20 seconds a day and seems powerful enough to clean the filter.I was worried about that since a dirty filter after an empty would just make the robot's suction decrease the next run. 


Navigation has been great! It seems to improve every run and is going under all the chairs my Roborock would get too nervous about going through. 



-----------ISSUES SO FAR-------------
So i've had a few more software issues but again nothing game changing. After removing the cliff sensors so that the robot works with the self empty base station, it again wasn't able to go on my high pile carpet. I picked up the robot and put it on the carpet then told it to run. I then looked at the map and saw it was CREATING A NEW MAP and I couldn't see my old map. Had some slight uneasy feeling that I would need to remap my whole apartment again. I went into the map settings and tried enabling multifloor map saving. THIS WORKED! I immediately found my original map of my whole apartment and loaded that back up. 


For the time being i'm going to place my robot on the area rug and have it create a new map for just the rug until I work out a way to tape or press down the edges of my pile carpet so the vacuum can do the whole apartment in one run. Again, not a deal breaker by any means because it's still able to vacuum the high pile carpet once its on it and doesn't have EMF issues.


---------EDIT UPDATE-----(09/17/2020)


-------The Good----------


I was asked by u/fishy6868 to run some comparison tests on the mopping functionality of both robots. 

firstly here is a picture of both pads and pad velcro plates. [Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/rBuCxpe)


[Second Picture of pads](https://imgur.com/a/OcVvd13)


You can see from the photos that the Roborock pad is about 10-15% larger than the Ecovac pad. 

I let the T8 mop my whole apartment (besides the carpets) and then compared the results to my S6 tests. I ran both robots on max water level with only one pass in each room. 


Both robots seem to mob about the same which is to say they aren't amazing, but the do a decent job in maintaining your floors for day to day. I personally mop because cat litter likes to stick to the wood floor which has a hard time being picked up by both robot's brushes. Each mop pad was similar in dirtiness when can on different days though I noticed the Roborock, despite a bigger pad, likes to get a lot of the dirt in more of the middle part of the pad. 


Some things I noticed in comparing the pads is difference in methodology between companies. What I mean by this is that the Roborock has a bigger pad but it's much thinner. I think this is because of the tighter tolerance between the mopping pad and the floor when the mopping pad is installed on the Roborock. 


The Ecovac has a MUCH thicker pad but there seems to be more play between the floor and the pad when the pad is installed which seems to be for angular adjustment of the mopping pad as it goes up and down different grades of surfaces. 


All in all I'm satisfied with the mopping capability of the T8 and don't see it as a driving factor in deciding between either robot. If the differences were drastic I might have more trouble deciding but since the difference is negligible then I'm fine with either if given the choice.  


The navigation keeps getting better. I HAVE YET TO PUT A SINGLE NO GO ZONE OR NO MOP ZONE IN MY MAP. It's amazing because with the Roborock I had to put a lot of them (by the nightstands where cables lay, by the cat bowl it never avoided, around the high pile rug that it would always error out on,etc). Simply amazing. It also has gotten smarter about going under my chairs which the Roborock never did because it never was confident enough to.




Haven't had simple map issue since I turned on multi floor mapping. 


-----The bad------


Okay so I took the cliff sensor tape off of all the sensors the other day when I found that they were interfering with the auto empty function from actually working for some reason. After removing these sensors the T8 is able to still get up onto my high pile carpet rug, but it has trouble with navigation once on it (probably from the sensors going on and off about different distances to the floor). I does a lot of side to side motions when trying to go in straight lines (like the guy who posted about his Roborock acting drunk). This doesn't seem to be a deal breaker for me though as much as it was for the Roborock because at least the T8 can clean 100% of my wood floor. The S6 didn't do that because of the EMF issue. Also, the T8 never spits out any errors or stops cleaning which the S6 would do a lot if I put it on that carpet.. 



Maybe down the road i'll figure out how to get it to be more reliable in navigation on the high pile rug. Again though, at least it can get up on the rug and doesn't error out when attempting to clean it. After a few days I am strongly leaning towards keeping the T8 and returning the S6MaxV since i'm not having any major issues.






-------UPDATE 09/19/2020----------

So I've decided that i've done enough testing; I'm returning the Roborock S6MaxV. The T8 is just much better fitting for my needs and has better avoidance. I also hooked it up to Alexa and I can confirm that it allows me to tell it to clean specific rooms or areas with my voice which is something I had wished the Roborock would be able to do. 


I contacted Ecovac support about issues with splitting rooms and they confirmed my theory which is that you can't split a virtually split room. You can only split along walls the LIDAR has confirmed. while that is a bummer, it's not a deal breaker and they said they aim to improve this in the future. I was still able to split 90% of the rooms the way I wanted perfectly. 


Still think that the T8 picks up more hair on carpet than the Roborock. Each day I run it on my medium pile carpeted bedroom and it fills up half the bin where the S6MaxV only filled MAYBE 1/4th. Also when I run my regular standing vacuum after a cleaning run with the T8 I get less in the bin in conparison.  


Navigation still isn't as perfect as the Roborock (it sometimes does little circles but maybe that's it trying to avoid stuff or navigate) but it's 90% cose to the Roborocks so the pros out weight any negatives in that regard. 


I will say though I'm going to miss the active community this sub has. Ecovacs has posts that are weeks old...


Hope this helps anyone trying to decide what's best for their home! Maybe in a few weeks when I get more data i'll add more information if anything changes but day to day everything has been great so seems pointless to still do daily updates. 


Cheers!


P.S It seems VacuumWars on Youtube gave the T8 a top pick over the S6MaxV for premium robot vacuum. Seems for Roborock you're better off going with the S5Max instead for the price to value. I think the S6MaxV is way overpriced at $750 currently."
"Got my first robot vacuum, the S6 PureVery impressed overall. 

I'm amazed at how much dirt it picks up, even on daily runs. Not even sure where all that dirt is coming from.

My only complaint is that it's too cautious and misses out on the edges of the room. It relies a little too much on the LIDAR vs the bump sensor. Wish there was a setting to make it more aggressive."
"best robot vacuum for non-tech peopleI have the S6 which I really like. My wife wants to get a Robovac for her parents who are not tech savvy, I don't think a Roborock is a good choice because you kind of really need to rely on the app to get the full use of it. I honestly don't think they would even like it or use it. Does anyone know of a robovac that is as good but more of a set it and forget it- Roomba?"
"H6 handheld: How to clean properlySo I’ve had the h6 for some time but can figure out how to clean it properly. The stupid video just show them opening the bin and everything falls neatly out, while in reality everything gets stuck by the sides of the filter and I need to remove the dust by hand. The sides are also so tight that I can’t get a finger in there but have to rely on sticking in utensils to clear the dust out. It’s not a clean process, I do it outside with a plastic bag wrapped around it and the air around me is filled with dust particles.

Now, the second thing I’m perplexed about is that when I google my questions or grievances I get nothing. I only get the same stupid ad videos and a couple of highly optimistic reviews. No guides on how to clean, no comments, no thoughts. It’s so strange because it’s the first time I’ve googled something and felt like I’m locked into a cubicle of 10 results that are just repeated no matter what I search for. Anyone else have this experience, and is it possible that the google results are being filtered to not leak bad reviews? Or am I just paranoid?"
"RoboRock Height (minus LIDAR)I picked up the Roomba S9+ (had the \~3yr old Neato Connected) and I'm close to happy with it (except needing the lights on).  Slight problem is it snags on high pile throw rug corners though it can fix itself without assistance and it can't fit under the cabinets in the kitchen (just barely too tall).

The bumper height is precisely 3 inches and there's an IR sensor in the front center that is at 3.5 inches.  It's probably 0.1 inches too tall on the bumpers.  Honestly.  2 or 3 mm shorter would do it.  I'm tempted to shave off the top edge of the S9 - there's a tall edge - though I'm not sure if the VSLAM relies on it.

I'm considering exchanging it for the S6 or S6Max V.  What is the height clearance for running along the edge of cabinets.  I believe this would discount the LIDAR.  The height I've seen discussed are about furniture clearance which includes the LIDAR.

I'm also open to suggestions.  No-go zones, single floor, room selection, mostly hardwood with a few throw rugs are the most important factors for me.  Object avoidance isn't terribly relevant."
"Amazon integration.Hi,   


   I'm going to be buying an S6 in the next month or two to help with the day to day upkeep of my condo's main floor. I was wondering how advanced the echo integration is? I've heard that Xiaomi's robots hav pretty basic support. Would it be possible for me to have my echo dot start the vacuum while I'm away at work? or should i rely on a cleaning schedule for this?"
"Where can i find bags for the Roborock H7?I've ordered the **Roborock H7 stick vacuum** (european version) for my parents from a local retail store.

From the product description it wasn't clear if any dust bags are included. I think they will need some bags because it's better to keep the dust trapped and correctly dispose of it.

So, I checked the Roborock lyfestyle Store on AliX since they are one of the main resellers (often linked on the official RR site) but even they dont carry it: [https://gshopper.aliexpress.com/store/group/Accessories/3205065\_518419454.html](https://gshopper.aliexpress.com/store/group/Accessories/3205065_518419454.html)

Is there a specific place you have bought H7 dust bags from, that is reliable and trustworthy ?

Thank you."
"Is it true that S5 Max cleans better than S6 MaxV ?Trying to decide between the two options and this review from a seemingly trustworthy site says S5 Max performs better than S6MaxV in both AirFlow and Cleaning Tests.  
What has been your experience ?

"Longevity?Hey all.
I'm looking at buying either an S7 MaxV ultra or the newer S8 Pro Ultra.

These machines are no doubt bloody pricey, and finding it hard to part with my money without knowing or having an idea of how long I can expect these things to work for before breaking and needing repair or completely failing and needing replacing.

Any real world experience would be greatly appreciated."
"Waterproof base station?I've got the S7 with the ""mop lifting"" technology. Let's be honest, it can still sort of touch the floor and drag a little--at least with the aftermarket mop pads. The problem is that after mopping it docks on my wood floors and the wet pad sits on the wood. Does anybody make any sort of plastic/waterproof base that covers the entire vacuum cleaner? I'm getting by with a less elegant fix for now but just curious if there's anything anybody has found that looks nice"
"S7 MaxV Ultra is hopeless.Just thought I’d put this here for anyone umming and ahhing over buying one of these, as I wish I had seen some more negative reviews before dropping $2,500AUD on this piece of junk. 

I bought one of these a few months ago, and up until now I’ve been in denial about how bad it is due to how much money I wasted on it, but I’m finally at my wits end with this product.

I think I’d get a better mopping result if I put wet socks on my Golden Retriever’s feet and chased him around the house to be completely honest. 

I thought the whole point behind putting the main brush in front of the mop would mean it was able to pick up all of the crap off the tiles before it had the chance to drag the mop through it? 

Now I’m chasing the Roborock around be house with paper towels cleaning up all the wet hair it’s decided to drag all over the house. Amazing technology!!

Let’s not forget the minuscule amount of hair it’s able to remove from the carpeted area’s of the house even with it running in Max+ mode!

If this is the be all, end all of robotic vacuum’s, the technology is still far from being where it needs to be unfortunately."
"Which roborock should I get?Hello everyone, 

I’ve decided to pull the trigger on my first ever robot vacuum and I’ve been lurking on these roborocks for a long time. 
As to my needs, I currently live in a small apartment (about 50 sqm/540 sqft), tile only floor(except a small towel like carpet in the bathroom), no pets, no kids and not a lot of mess overall.

I am expected to be moving in a bigger place in a few months but floors are going to stay tile only and might adopt a dog in future (next year or so). 

I need it to keep my floors clean and require as little handling as possible (hence the ultra dock). Mopping also looks like a nice feature to have and not having to refill the tank and clean the mop all the time seems like it could save some time. 

I was considering the S8 pro ultra or the S7 MaxV Ultra since both have the dock that refills the tank and washes the mop, however the S8+ also came up as an option since I consider my apartment to be fairly clean so maybe mopping routine wouldn’t be so frequent as to bother me all the time. 

The S8 just launched where I live and it costs $1210 for the S8 pro ultra (after taxes) or $780 for the S8+. 
The S7 maxV ultra goes for $918 although it was on sale for $840 just a couple of weeks ago so I’m expecting to snap it for that price soon when it goes on sale again. 
Honestly, given the price difference the S7 maxv ultra seems more appealing than the S8 pro ultra, but would you guys consider a the S8+ be a better buy than the S7 maxv ultra? (regardless of price since they’re not too far apart, I’m wondering if the dual vibrating mop and dual rollers are better to have than an Ultra dock that takes care of mopping almost completely)

Thanks!"
"Let's talk about cleaning the dirty water tank 😅Hi everyone 👋

I've been using the Roborock S7 Pro Ultra for few months now and it is a truly fantastic ally on a daily basis. 

The only challenge I face is cleaning the 2 water tanks (dirty water tank + clean water tank).  
I'm using the OMO cleaning solution from Roborock even if I'm not really sure it does a difference to be honest. 🫠

The dirty water tank starts to look more and more like the bottom of a pond. I mean, no algaes and stuff, but it just look slightly gross on the overall and smell bad (I know it's dirty water!). Plus this extra small viscous layer of dirt covering the whole thing inside added with little floating of *whateveritiscalled*... it just feels like a bacteria party 🦠🎉

I saw some people using white vinegar to clean, some saying no don't do it you're going to ruin the rubbers. Another spoke about OdoBan stuff. On my side, I rinse several time the 2 tanks each cycle, use distilled water to fill the clean water tank.

So, what's your experience? How do you keep the dirty water tank reasonably clean over time? :)   
A shot at the high pressure machine (just kidding). Some touch of bicarbonate? A plash of citric acid cleaning bath? please... help me end this bacteria party once and for all 🎯

Thanks in advance 🙏"
"S7 and Alexa voice commandsI have been trying to use Alexa to control my s7 and I found really frustrated that this is not working (at least not as expected). After adding the skill roborock plus to my Alexa I noticed that the voice commands only works when I manually launch the app on the device other wise Alexa doesn't know what I am talking about. 

But honestly if I have to open my phone to launch the app on my Alexa I am better off using the roborock app to click start cleaning 😅

Have any of you managed to get this working? (Ps I am relatively new to both devices (Alexa and roborock))"
"Which roborock for me?Roborock’s website recommended the S7 MaxV Ultra - and holy hell I’m not paying that price tag. Definitely overkill for what I need.

I just need this thing to clean my living room and kitchen (which are connected). The rest of the house is inaccessible because of the staircase. 

Here’s some things to consider:

-Floor space is 60 square meters

-All of it is hardwood floors except for one medium-high carpet that is 3x2 meters

-I don’t really care about mopping (or should I?)

-We have a dog (golden retriever) - not a crazy shedder, but certainly too much hair everywhere at the moment

-There’s dog toys or the kid’s toys scattered around the floor pretty often 

-I want this vacuum to be as low maintenance as possible. Once it’s set up and running properly I honestly just want to forget it exists and just let it do it’s job

Anyways, if I could get some pointers as to what works best for my situation that would be great!"
"Help Request: my roborock s5 gets ""lost"" when cleaning my bedroom, why could that be?Hello there, you wonderful hive-mind,

I have this trusty Roborock S5, my robotic companion for the past four years. I adore it, but boy, is it acting up since we moved! It's got a thing for the master bedroom. It's like it's playing hide and seek but is just terrible at finding its way back. Gets ""lost"" - a fancy way of saying, it forgets where its charging dock is! And the map it creates afterward? It's like a child's imaginative drawing - all these phantom walls and rooms. Here's what I mean:

https://preview.redd.it/fqks34mcz02b1.jpg?width=408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1bd5329c813e4f98c7488fcf61b09d5dfdb8c15

And there are times when it dreams up a whole new house! Can you imagine? Now, I've tried the lot: ask it to give the whole house a whirl, did the solo room dance, even the master bedroom only jig with zone cleaning. But nope, it's stubborn as a mule.

Now it's no biggie really. When it gets tired, it just sleeps (aww), and I have to play the hero and carry it back to its dock. But honestly, it's a bit like having a naughty toddler. Any of you geniuses got a clue why this is happening or what I can do? Loads of thanks!"
"Roborock doesnt care about customers in Europe.I bought my S7 Maxv Ultra a year ago and bought the stupid OMO roborock approved cleaning solution. It didnt really clean well, but I used it anyways. I paid a whopping 30 € (32$) for it. Iirc a 750ml bottle of cleaning solution. In itself ridicilous. When I look at the prices in the USA it's somewhat reasonable by comparison.

When asking roborock via support why it has to be this specific cleaning solution and cant be anything else and if they could provide me with a list of things that arent allowed to be in a cleaner to be okay with the system, they basically ignored my question.

Now that my cleaning solution is empty I tried to buy new one via aliexpress (it doesnt get sold here a anywhere. Not at Shops, not via the Internet), because I also bought the first batch via that. Just so you know I bought the first bottle via a link provided by the roborock support.

Problem being, the listing from back then isnt up anymore, so I asked them again where to buy so it's not fake or smth and they sent me a link. The seller asks an even more ridicilous 45 € (48$) for one bottle and doesnt even ship to my country.

I told the support that and they havent answered me anymore.

Im honestly disappointed. I paid 1400€ (1500$) for this thing and I expected to get at least a basic level of support.

Ive been just spraying cleaning solution on the floor when he does it, since that doesnt introduce any cleaner into the fresh water circuit and supposedly doesnt destroy anything. But honestly, that's not what I bought the machine for. If I wanted to be involved myself I wouldve just done it myself. 

I also dont understand why they arent giving the ppl in Europe this Module that just gets connected with ur normal fresh water and used water circuits so u dont have to change the water at all. Just in China and according to Support a couple of months ago also wont come to Europe.. 

If you got any tips to help me out, go ahead. Im just disappointed."
"S7 MavV vs. S7 MaxV Ultra?Sorry for the ignorant post. Current S6 owner, would love the S7 MaxV for the dual vacuum/mop function, plus, I **really** want the auto-fill/drain dock bit.

My question is: if I get the S7 MaxV *by itself*, are the requisite docks available on Ali? Or do I need to get the S7 MaxV Ultra and then just get the fill/drain kit from Ali?

I'm honestly not sure what I need to get on Aliexpress vs. part of the initial order. Ideally, I want the auto-dry for the mop + the auto-drain/fill for dirty and clean mop water.

Can y'all point me in the right direction? I saw another post where something split their cold water washing machine line and that's exactly what I've been envisioning.

Thanks!"
"Can I buy the ultra dock if I already own just the S7 MaxV?I don't see it on roborock's website.  Can you not buy just the ultra dock to go with an already compatible robot?

**EDIT:  Thanks for the info guys.  I should have done a bit more research before but I was able to get an RMA from Amazon to send the vacuum back.**  

Best buy had an S7 MaxV ultra open box deal that I got.  I checked before leaving the store that everything was in there and it doesn't look like anything was touched.  Everything still was taped up, front sensor still had the QR code sticker on it, etc.

I ran it last night and this morning and everything works great.  I debated waiting for the S8 Ultra but honestly, I don't think it's worth the extra $$ vs what I ended up getting this one for ($1200 after tax out the door)"
"S7 Plus, but which one?I've been meaning to get the S7 Plus for some time. However, where I live, it currently seems to be almost exclusively available in white which has made me second-guess because I'm worried that with such a light color, it will end up constantly looking dirty. Otoh, I've seen a video in which a black S7 had a lot of what appeared to be scratches or smears on the sides, which was looking just gnarly, so I'm wondering if maybe white is the superior color after all.

&#x200B;

Researching further, I found that the S7 MaxV Plus could be a good alternative (which would also be more easily available in black), especially because it's supposed to be better at recognizing obstacles, but I'm not sure if this is worth the higher price.

&#x200B;

I was thinking that if I'm getting the S7 MaxV, I could just as well go all-in and get the S7 MaxV Ultra as, honestly, I can see myself not wanting to use the mop function a lot due to not wanting to deal with the cloth after each run. But at that point, it really has to be worth it because the price is way higher than what I originally wanted to spend, and there seem to be some drawbacks.

I've seen a video in which a guy was pointing out that you'll regularly need to clean the station which seems a lot nastier and time-consuming than changing the cloth. 

I only have two smaller rooms that need regular mopping, so I assume that I'll only need to change the cloth after each run, and not mid-run.

Do I assume correctly that the Ultra station also dries the cloth? So that the vac can sit in the station with the cloth on for a couple of days after a mopping run? Or would I also need to remove the cloth after each run?

Having to use dust bags is a drawback as well, but I think I can deal with that better than with with a mop-cleaning function that, in the worst case, gives me more work than a station without.

"Honest opinions from folks who've had Roomba s9+ and Roborock s7Hi everyone, this is a great community. I currently have a Roomba s9+, but have become more and more interested in the Roborock s7. We have a mixture of hardwood, tile and carpet ( as well as area rugs). I do love the auto-emptying on my Roomba, but I don't love certain things like the constant replacement of the brush extractors and sometimes wonky navigation. If I did go with the s7, I would probably spring for the self-empty bin for that.

&#x200B;

My questions-if anyone here has had both, is which did you find performed better in terms of debris pickup, navigation, maintenance, baby-sitting it (stuck, errors, etc.)? I've watched review videos but I thought i'd reach out to the community for some real insight. Thanks, guys!"
"Official - New Models From Roborock! S8 Series & Dyad Pro[I put together a quick Youtube video on all the new models from Roborock.](https://youtu.be/UsJoF-ldwhM)

Honestly I think the S8 is a bit of an evolution of the S7 series vs a revolution.  Not a ton of changes, but I am excited for the dual roller brushes and the more powerful vacuum motor.  Also glad object avoidance is now standard on the S8.  I wish they made more changes to the lifting mopping system to allow it to lift higher. 

The S8 Pro is a different model which now includes a lifting roller brush system which is a first in the industry.  I am glad to see it since the roller brush housing plate on the S7 drags the floor when mopping.   The S8 Pro also has an additional vibrating motor to improve performance of the Vibrarise system and you better believe I am going to test that!  

The new ""RockDock"" looks like a slight change from the older Empty Wash Fill Dock, however I do think it looks better and am pleased to see the dryer module is now standard.  I wish they gave a bagless option and a separate detergent tank.  Keep in mind only the S8 Pro is going to work with the Ultra aka RockDock.  The S8 does not have the ability to have the water tank filled or to be able to charge from the Ultra dock which required front charging contacts on the front bumper.

Why does the dock on the S8+ look like the cheaper Q series dock??

The S8 will be available mid April in the US for around $749

No prices or launch dates have been given for the S8 + or the S8 Pro Ultra

I am testing the Dyad Pro now it is a big improvement from the last model.  I think it should be called the Dyad 2 rather than the pro though.  It now stands on its own without a kickstand, includes a separate detergent tank and a heated hot air drying system built into the dock.

The Dyad Pro will go on sale mid January on Amazon for around $449

"S7MVU Dryer Module from AliExpress (here in USA) - SUCCESSI just thought I'd report that due to the usual lack of, and/or long wait-time for, availability of Roborock's S7MVU Dryer Module on their website, I purchased and successfully installed their Dryer Module after obtaining one from AliExpress in China.  The unit and app work exactly as they are supposed to on my unit here in the USA.  The main advantages to buying it from AE in China (as opposed to Roborock) are, as far as I can tell:

\- **Availability and Shipping Speed**:  I ordered it on Dec 14, and it arrived today, Dec 27, so 13 days delivery time to my front door here in the SF Bay Area (Roborock doesn't even have it in stock and word is it won't be until sometime between roughly Jan 31 and March 1).

\- **OEM or Knockoff?**:  The box and equipment carried the official Roborock brand markings, except additional verbiage is in Chinese of course; you'll toss everything anyway so ultimately it's a moot point (naturally, Roborock's US version will be in English).

\- **Electrical Hookup/Compatibility**:  As another reviewer on AE's website stated, it comes with an adapter plug for your country, and indeed, included a 3-prong adapter for me here in the U.S.  It works perfectly well without any concerns for 220/110 voltage.  I'm no electrician but perhaps it's like many internationally-adaptive dual-voltage shavers and hair dryers that automatically switch to the correct voltage, working virtually anywhere (Roborock's US version would probably indicate 110V).

\- **App Compatibility?**:  Yes.  The initial invoking and purchase confirmation in the Roborock app are present as expected, and the 2, 3, and 4-hour drying choices are present and changeable.

\- **Price?**  **It cost me exactly and entirely $58.43 USD, shipping included - SWEAR!**  For my City and County (San Leandro, Alameda Co., Calif.), that's a (c'MON 4th grade math...!) 54% of the full price I'd pay on Roborock's website (roughly $109:  @$99 + about $10 tax)!!

\- **Returnable?**  If you've not returned anything to AliExpress before (or haven't done so in a year or something like that), you have 15 days to return it absolutely free -- that includes shipping to China -- for a full refund (I'm not sure if Roborock -- which of course is not Amazon  -- will allow a return unless the product is defective).

\- **Downside?**  Uh, you have that additional China-to-\[your country\] adapter plugged into your wall; but honestly, I can't see mine and who cares anyway?!  ;-)

\- **Summation**:  After I received and installed it (literally two minutes), I performed a zone mop of a few feet (haha), just to monitor it returning to the dock to confirm the dryer mechanism automatically engaged.  It did!  I feel I've made a prescient and exceptional purchase.  Just thought you folks might want to consider this option similarly should you feel this is something you'd like to own.  Either way, enjoy your S7MVU!  :-)

"Hey guysLooking at the s7 max ultra. I have two small kids and want to know what the vacuum / mop is like with food crumbs left after feeding time in the zoo ( those with kids will understand ) 

Most of the reviews at of rice and other bits just looking for honest reviews from here"
Scratched floor from s7mvu?!?I was just wondering if anyone else has gotten scratched floors from the S7mvu? I have marble floors throughout my entire home and I’m noticing these scratch marks all over the entire floor. I’m so disappointed bc now I have to return it. I honestly thought this product was great on all types but apparently not. Super frustrated
"Does the S7 MaxV object recognition get better with time?The S7 MaxV is my first robot vacuum and while the cleaning is phenomenal, I am a little disappointed with it's object recognition capabilities. I have a tangle of wires next to my nightstand, connected to a power strip, and it always sucks up the wires. It also cannot identify low obstacles such as the base of my speaker stands.

I have been using no go zones to get around it but honestly it's a little disappointing that such an expensive piece of equipment cannot recognize objects the way it's advertised.

I am wondering if there is some sort of ai that actually learns and improves the object recognition, or am I stuck with using no go zones?"
"With the S7 maxv ultra, am I supposed to be removing the wet mop cloth after each use?I'm honestly not sure if I'm supposed to be leaving it on or not. It seems to me like it might get moldy or mildewy if just left to its own devices?"
"S7 MaxV Ultra: Map reset itself and then drained 8% of it's battery trying to reposition itself. Now it can't move because the wheels are suspended...on flat ground.I'm suddenly having problems with my S7 MaxV so I think I'm going to return it while it's still in the return window. Robot tech is not quite where I want it to be yet. Maybe the S8 will have better software, but honestly it probably won't be fully autonomous / headache free for a couple more years."

Just in the last week it has started getting lost and not able to find the docking station.  Checked for firmware updates and we are up to date.  Anyone else have this issue?  Is there a way to fix this?  I hope its not some fatal flaw as thing is great.....

EDIT: We have not moved the docking station at all"
"Quality of the Roborock appI have just purchased S7 MaxV, and while the robot itself makes a decent impression, the iOS app does not. I immediately noticed two things:

1. The password length for the roborock account limited to only 12 characters. Why? I see no reason for this limitation unless you intentionally want passwords to be easier to crack. Almost nobody does that.
2. Why there is no ipad version of the app? The interface looks ugly and unpolished

Honestly, it just seems lazy to release the app in such state. Especially when you charge well over $1k for your product and the app is actually one of the most important features. Even on the iphone, the UI feels like those other garbage apps, made as cheaply as possible.

Please Roborock, put more effort into it or hire a competent mobile app developer. It does make a difference for a lot of people."
"H6 Replacement BatteryDoes anyone know where I can purchase a replacement battery for my H6? It's a little over a year old and does very quickly.

I see a bunch in AliExpress with a 2 month delivery estimate but I honestly don't know what's legit and what's not. 

Any help is appreciated."
"Decisions: S5 repair vs. Q5 vs. S7MaxVI am extremely torn.

I own a two and a half year old S5 that is now 'acting up'. Coming off the dock after cleaning -almost every other time - and giving the charging error message. So far every time I clean the contacts it stays on the dock and charges but I never know what it will do after the next cleaning. Honestly not sure cleaning and charging properly is not a coincidence but its the new routine (until it isn't). Read some posts that talk about some internal failure that requires replacing and soldering. That's not in my skillset.  Irritating and makes the unit unreliable without intervention.

I'm tempted to get a replacement since I'm pretty sure I'm looking at the better part of 150.00 to have it repaired and shipped - given what I'm reading about Roborock support when out of warranty.

I don't care about mopping or an empting dock. I stopped using the mopping on the s5 because all it does in my mind is push floor dirt around after the first 10 square feet it mops - so pad needs to be cleaned and that kills time savings. I do care about vacuuming floors and crevices (between tile).

The q5 and s7maxV are on my radar and looking for advise/use here because I know this community is  honest compared to Amazon and Roborock reviews.

The Q5 is obvious since it doesn't mop. It should clean as well if not better than my s5 (but reviews indicate it has issues with cleaning carpet (not much worse or better than the s5 so that would be an improvement of sorts). I also read it does NOT filter fine particles from its exhaust. (Per rtings). That has me concerned.

The S7 maxV is intriguing because of the extra suction power. Yes. More $$. I'm sure the 5100Pa is overkill on hardwood....but how well will it clean carpet and fine pet hair on carpet - especially compared to other vacs.

Decisions"
"Roborock G10s Import to UK QuestionsI can possibly buy Roborock G10s Plus directly from China and get it delivered to be used in UK, but I was told this machine will not be able to connect to the smart home app. I had similar experience with smart home before where this is only a matter of connecting to China Server / European servers, and I am wondering what kinds of blocks they actually implemented and will that be a workaround. Honestly, I don't care if this can be connected to the smart home app if the machine can perform the functions if I can avoid the 80%+ mark up for a international model.

Any thought or experience?"

"Upgrade from Kyvol e31 to Roborock S7 MaxV- is it going to be noticeable?Hi everyone,

I have an old  cheap Kyvol e31, and to be honest - it’s making me more and more annoyed. It gets stuck very often in places like under the sofa. Sometimes it manages to release itself, but usually not. I could, technically keep it away from that place with using magnetic stripe, but it looks bad. The quality of cleaning is also not enough and I actually can’t leave it to clean for itself without my surveillance.

I wonder, if upgrade to Roborock S7 MaxV would be good idea? I don’t have carpets or pets. Would I be able to leave it completely unattended and come back home to have clean and mopped floors? 
Perhaps anyone can help? 

Thanks in advance!"

"Roborock S7 MaxV Plus UK power cableHey

I have ordered the Roborock S7 MaxV Plus from [amazon.de](https://amazon.de), shipping to the UK. I will need to get a replacement power cable for the dock as it will come with an EU plug type.

Does anyone know which type of cable I will need? Or do you have a link to one that you know works?

Thanks!"
"New flat, Dyson stick / S7 MaxV?I'm moving into a small, 1 bedroom flat with my partner, where we both work demanding jobs that involve work during the day and night. Should we invest in a proper automated vaccuum/mop system (eyeing out the S7 MaxV with Ultra dock) or rather go for a cordless stick, such as a Dyson? The flat is around 600sqft/58sqm, carpet and hardwood floors/no pets (yet, this will probably change soon!).

Any honest thoughts/different suggestions always welcome! :)"
"Massive design flaw with s7 auto dockI have to empty the dock manually digging my hands into the small slot just to take out the dirt/pet hair manually every week because it will not empty to the dock. This is a massive design fault in that the only way for the trash to empty the vacuum is through the same hole it sucks it in. Any pet hair gets stuck in the robot and won't be sucked out of the small robot slit. I just payed near a thousand for something that doesn't do what I bought it for. Can I refund this ,roborock just couldn't make a difrent hole slot for the trash like every other robot does."
"E4 sidebrush motor damage. Tiny piece of the copper brush came off, and now I'm getting error 17 every 1-60 minutes. Do I really need to order a whole motor because this tiny piece broke?Copper side brush sort of chipped. now it's causing sporadic error 17s. the piece that broke is absolutely tiny. **Do I really have to pay 20 bucks and wait a month for a an entire motor I don't need to come from China?** Just seems wasteful and silly to me, and **I'm wondering if I have any other options.** I do actually live right next to a vacuum shop, but I guarantee they're just gonna charge me extra to do basically the same thing. Not even sure if they really deal with the robot vacs. Some people just really dislike the concept for some reason.

I'll try to post a pic but honestly I'll probably forget.

I guess while we're here it'd be neat to hear how people feel about OEM vs third party stuff. Brushes, filters, and that sort of thing. Haven't had an OEM main brush or filter in forever, but I've definitely noticed that off-brand brushes get torn really easily. Definitely miss the OEM side brush though. The more brush-like off brands tend to carry stuff around, especially dog fur, and just toss it wherever. Not worth $20 for two piece of rubber though."
"Anyone else having horrible pet hair pickup on carpet with S7 MaxV?Just got my S7 MaxV. I've ran it twice now and am noticing HORRIBLE pet hair pickup with my medium pile carpet. I'm talking almost non-existent pet hair in the bin after it is done, and I'll notice dozens of clumps of hair it has made on the carpet. It's like it winds up the pet hair into tightly wound piles and spits them out instead of sucking them up.

This is my 3rd robot vacuum (previous two were deebots) and I was really excited about the extra suction and advanced features on this. Honestly, I am shocked with how bad it is at picking up pet hair...I even enabled the ""Max+"" option in the settings and see no difference.

Anyone else experiencing this? Am I doing something wrong?"
"What to get? New robotHello guys I have an awesome S5 max, my brother want to buy one, what should I look into the new models? Thanks"
back to the dock for a recharge at 20%?Is there any way to set the software to make my s4 max not return to the dock at 20%? I'd rather it either wait until it gets down to 10% or maybe just die in place honestly. I feel it's a little excessive that it reserves an entire fifth of its battery life just to get back to the dock. I know some homes are gigantic but it's still a bit much.
"Not Impressed, help needed.Don't get me wrong, the advertising, the reviews, the fanbase and such sell these things as a great invention. I have had nothing but issues to be honest and it started with the Roborock app not being able to connect and setup the cleaner and I had to use the Xiaomi Home app to even get it going.  


I am using it in the office and have nothing on the ground but grey and dark grey carpet tiles, no hard floors and office dividers to make cubicles, the only other things on the ground are chairs, tables and cables to the wall for computers.  


I have been attempting to map the office for the first time all day now, it seems to find a immaginary wall and create small room sized cleaning zones or something, does that one really nice and then turns into a 3 year old with a crayon when you look at the map.  


Anything I need to know when mapping large areas, any help would be great.  


A open door stopped it dead in it's tracks for some reason and it kept saying it was stuck.  


I know black is horrible for LiDar, does having black cable ducting around the floor level on the wall cause this cleaner to just go super dumb in mapping or am I going to have to somehow let it do this for a week?  


Another issue when not completed it docks for charge but then when I tap clean it wipes the map and starts again."
"E25 Just openedTo be honest, I bought this unit years ago and due to small grandchildren, simply never opened it. Finally moved to anew home, and decided to FINALLY set up the robot. I am trying to get the app to see an E25 but it is as if they are not supporting this model on the app?"
Total Garbage!
"Comparing my roomba i7+ to my S4 MAX.When comparing my i7+ and my s4 max, I find the i7 just constantly slams into shit full speed. The s4 isn’t great in that regard, but it at least slows down before it hits something. I just sat and watched my i7 plow full speed into the same couch leg 4 times in a row. 

Also, the mapping doesn’t seem particularly great? The i7 has somehow missed my ENTIRE FUCKING KITCHEN. After multiple mapping runs. 

What the fuck. 

I expected the i7 to be an upgrade but so far it’s actually been performing worse than my s4. It loves to just aimlessly spin, takes 2x as often to complete a run, and has already accumulated a ton of scratches from hitting stuff.

The cleaning base has been absolutely amazing so far though. 

The app is so-so. It doesn’t seem to have the stupid limitations on number of no-go zones and stuff that Roborock has, but it also doesn’t give you any of the customization that the Roborock gives you. Your only option seems to be whether you want 1 pass or 2 passes - can’t choose power level or anything like that. 

Honestly if I had paid full price for it I’d be returning it. It sure as fuck isn’t worth the $700+ it’s listed for from my current experience with it."
"Roborock S7 and NETGEAR Orbi Mesh NetworkI am looking at getting the S7 and am reading mixed reviews if this will work with my network. To be honest, it seems most of the vacuums have trouble with these mesh networks. Does anyone have experience connecting to the Orbi Network?

"Alexa skill questionFirst of all, I have a S4 Max with defined and  named rooms.  How do I specify a room to clean with the Alexa skill? It will only start a clean cycle of the whole floor. And which skill is right? I'm using ""robo rock plus"" which the reviews say has selective room mode. 

Also is there a way to tell it to clean a specific zone?"
"Would you rather get the Ecovacs T8+ or S7+?hey there!  


I bought a Ecovacs t8+ (still within revocation time) for a cheap price tag of 460€.  
I am quite happy with it honestly - its just 2 things that do annoy me:  


1. Blows much Air to the side of the vacuum robot and blows the pet hair away on hard floor
2. A bit of annoying tangle of long hair and cat hair in brush roll and mini roll infront  


Is the S7+ better in this regard? I am worried because it doesn't have any sensor infornt so in probably will take my cables on a run right?  


Would you say the S7+ would be better - for a price increase of around 300€ than the T8+?"
"S6maxv main brushLet me start with, I purchased this vacuum, so I'm not some roborock troll looking to bash RR.

That said, I don't have some unhealthy love affair with a vacuum. I'm just asking a few questions to get some honest input to help me decide if this is the right product for me and what I should expect.

I understand that the main brush HAD issues getting stuck, and this WAS ADDRESSED with a software update to slow down the spinning to keep it from overheating and burning out the motor.

I admit that I might not have all the details correct, and I understand this is a general overview of the situation. Please correct me if I'm significantly wrong on these facts.

Has the software update affected the main brush, impacting the robot's ability to clean the carpet? If so, to what degree is the robot still usable for cleaning the carpet?

Are there better RR options?

Thanks"
"(S5 MAX) After much trial and error (and wasted soap...) I've finally found a solution to the mop not making even contact with my floor!Greetings good people of r/Roborock. I've been loving my S5 Max since I got it, it really has changed my life as I'm very sensitive to dust. However, the mopping feature was, to me at least, very dissapointing. The mop wouldn't make even, complete contact with the floor leaving several lines of dry floor after mopping.

I started searching everywhere for a solution, a thicker mop pad, some mod I could do whatever and I tried some of them (mostly cutting a sponge and fitting it in there) but it just did not work out at all. Now the reason for this post is that I think I've finally cracked the code and I figured someone else might need a little nudge in the right direction too!

Sadly I didn't take any pictures before or during (honestly because I doubted this would work) but if anyone is interested I can make it happen next time I mop :)

So here's what I did:

I bought this soap: [https://store.irobot.com/default/parts-and-accessories/braava-accessories/m6-braava-jet/braava-jet-hard-floor-cleaner/4632813.html](https://store.irobot.com/default/parts-and-accessories/braava-accessories/m6-braava-jet/braava-jet-hard-floor-cleaner/4632813.html) from a local webstore that sold robot vacuum parts, now it is made for the iRobot Brava Jet but I figured if it doesn't clog their tank surely it won't clog mine (and it hasn't so far). I use 5 caps full for each tank and I also rinse the tank afterwards to make sure there is no leftover soap in there.

I then found a cleaning cloth that had roughly the same type of fabric as the mop pad itself and then it struck me, what if I just cut this up into pieces that are about the same as the mot cloth (sans the velcro-part) and stack them?

And so I did. First I cut one and checked how thick it became and wasn't quite convinced yet, so I made two more. Then I soaked all three as well as the mop pad and wringed them, put the three pieces of cloth in the mop pad bracket, installed the mop pad on top and then gave the mop one more cap of the soap spread out evenly.

The result? Smooth, even lines, perfect mopping and a nice smell to boot! Hope this helps someone else as well, it certainly made me love my S5 even more :D

Edit: forgot to attach the photos, LOL: [https://imgur.com/a/CZdcEam](https://imgur.com/a/CZdcEam)"
"S7+ vs S7 MaxV Plus auto empty dock questionsThe 2 docks look identical, but is that confirmed?

I just bought the S7+ on Amazon, and I think I’m going to return it.  However, I have the Cyclone/bagless option ordered directly from Roborock.  I’m assuming I can buy the S7 MaxV plus and re-use the cyclone?

I don’t have need of the auto cleaning/filling mop features.  I do however like the auto-empty docks.  I’m honestly debating if the new cameras/obstacle avoidance is worth the hassle of return/re-purchase.

Anyway, enough rambling.  Are the docks the same?"
"Roborock is about to launch a model (g10) in China which can clean the mop automaticallyIt looks amazing. Honestly, many robot vacuum brands in China have recently launched or will be launching products that have better mopping ability and can clean the mop automatically. I wonder whether any of them will be available in the US soon. Narwal has one product with those features available currently being sold in the US, but the price is absurd given that it is more than doubled in the US(I understand that the labor cost is substantially higher here but even with that in mind, I still find it hard to justify the price). In the meanwhile, traditional brands like iRobot seem to have stopped innovating. Is it because that the general public here in the US finds those features redundant? I personally find them very appealing though."
Is it possible to protect carpets?Hey guys. I recently got a S6 for my parents and while they love the thing they’re scared for their carpets. They have some old oriental rugs and we’ve noticed that the S6 not only pulls fringes but also the threads in the carpet themselves. Now they would like it to only clean the hard floor but the problem is the whole place is plastered with carpets in every room. So I thought about setting up no go areas / walls around the carpets but then the roborock wouldn’t be able to cross the room because as I understand the roborock doesn’t just not clean the blocked areas but also can’t drive through them. It would need to cross the blocked area (carpet) without cleaning it though. Is there any other way how they would be able to protect their carpets? They really love this thing but at the end of the day love their carpets more. Thanks!
"Maps doesn't load consistentlyI'm pretty upset to be honest. If you are gonna store the maps server side then at least have them work.

Am I the only one having this issues? Maps doesn't load most of the times.

When I go to the maps section it says it can't load them. Even tried 4G to see if it's my network.

We need the option to store this locally. I can't return it anymore since it's many months I bought it"
"S5 vs S5 MaxHi,

I have the opportunity to get an S5 for ridiculously cheap (about $250) but I'm seeing everywhere that the S5 Max is just better in every way. And to be honest, If it's that much better I wouldn't mind shelling out the cash, but if there's not a HUGE difference then I'd rather just get the S5 for dirt cheap. 

Basically, I just need help making this decision. I've watched videos and it seems like the mopping on the S5 is better but that's the only big difference."
"Update: S6 for garage (my shameful addiction)Here’s a short update to my [original post about an s6 in my garage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/k7yiy6/my_shameful_addiction_one_for_the_garage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

Some of you wondered how it would do with snow melt, water, leaves, etc.

Bottom line: do it!

Snow/water: slurps it up, then the suction stops but the brush continues. Can’t really notice a difference but I do pull it and clean it when it reports that it is wet. 

Leaves: gobbles them up no problem. Have to empty after a leaf day but not a big deal. 

Empty frequency: once every few weeks. Dustbin is super sooty and has road grime, very black and fine like brake dust etc. No apparent damage, honestly never fills up. 

Brush life: no issue here

Sensors/cleaning: it gets dustier faster, charging contacts are the first to need more frequent cleaning. 

Temperature: no issue for me, garage stays above 50 due to a furnace duct leak lol

Overall, the unit is dirtier and dustier, but dang it’s nice to walk out into the garage in bare feet or socks!"
"Network slow “hang”Yesterday I went to start my S5E and received a notification that the network was slow. I turned off the vacuum cleaner and turned it back on, and everything worked as expected (i.e. the map showed up and I could clean what I wanted).
Today I got the same error however a reboot has not fixed it. Reading earlier messages, I cleared the cache and I tried using my 5G connection instead of my Wi-Fi. Same issue. It sounds like this is a server side problem from Roborock. Are others experiencing this? Does anyone have a solid fix?  Honestly, the other fix of using a phone as a hotspot seems like a Band-Aid for a bigger problem. I have not tried that"
Where does the 180 min runtime estimate come from?Is it based on running it at the absolute weakest setting possible?  I run it at the highest power all the time and I WOULD get about 100-120 mins if it wouldn't refuse to work past 19% battery.  Because of that odd kill percent I get about 75-80 mins on a full charge.  Because I previously had a roomba that could barely make 60 mins I knew that I need to split the house into 3 jobs thru the day to get it all done.  But 100 mins short of advertised is a bit disappointing.  That said....it's a REALLY GREAT robovac.  I honestly don't have to pay any attention to it and it does a great job and avoids everything on the floor and seems to be able to pick up bigger things without a problem than my i7 did.
"Roborock S6 Pure custom voice pack.Hello everyone!

This might be a dumb question, but here we go. I would like to upload my own voice pack on the S6 Pure. Read a few articles and I know I need to root and install a new firmware. I have no problem in doing that, but I wasn't able to find any info regarding the Roborock app. Would the app still pair with my vacuum? I know most people are doing it to get out of the cloud and have the vacuum controlled locally, but privacy isn't really my concern (I don't even care to be honest). I just don't want to have to use the web interface like with Valetudo. 
Any info and advice is welcome."
"Trying to understand the differences between robo vacsHi all. Another new member who found their way to this group because my head is exploding!

After reading and watching a lot of reviews I was coming to the Deebot 960. However upon reading the Costco ($800) reviews which seem to be more honest and verified people don’t seem particularly happy with it. I noticed for example with vacuum wars YouTube channel that whilst there is good information it’s still about selling vacuums.

The other one I was thinking about was the S-6 however the new S5 max looks like it might be better?

This is for a very large house. Some rooms are 800sqft. Almost all wood floors. One room is raised 4 inches. At some point the upstairs and downstairs will also get included.

So where I’m confused is how well would each of these smarter vacuums handle those circumstances? Different floors. Large rooms. Navigation. 

As it’s mostly wood flooring I was thinking the mopping ability would be handy which is also what directed me to the above models. However, a second dedicated mopping robot could also work.

From my research I get the impression that the vacuums with auto Empty are not so good with navigation like the deebot and Roborock. Is this correct? And that the best vacs for navigation and room layout happen to have MPs anyway. 

Also, I saw a Makita vacuum which seems more appropriate for certain parts of the house which are unfinished however I think that is a dumb robot vacuum? Do any of you know about more industrial robot vacuum cleaners?

If you got this far, thank you. The rambling is simply because my head is exploding LOL!"
"Leaving mop head on for the dayHi guys,

I've bought myself an S5 MAX and I have to say, love it! We were shocked on how well it did on its first run.

I'm planning to use it around 2/3 times a day with scheduling, one full run on turbo setting in the morning to clean after last day. Second run around 4 pm after dinner, just kitchen and 3rd run around 9pm, just kitchen with mop.

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, we don't really have a time to remember to put the mop back before 9pm, I was wondering if we could just put it back in the morning and leave it there for the day and before we go to the bed just wash it?

Will it damage it somehow or is it fine to leave it for the day? In fairness its only one room with not a lot of mop zone. Also could I just leave that mop for few days and clean it like once a week? I'm planning to use 70/30 water/vinegar solution.

&#x200B;

I'm attaching a photo of my map. No. 1 name ""Kuchnia"" (excuse me for polish words).  Yes the mop zone in front of charging dock is unfortunately a carpet. I did wanted to put the entire carpet into no-mop zone but the app won't allow the charging dock to be inside that zone so I'm hopping it won't be much of a problem. The entire docking station with the robot is on the carpet under the dinning table as this was the only place we could leave it safely to work.

"New S5 Max - Dumb and DumberRecently received an S5 Max after reading various glowing reviews but I can honestly say I don't know why it's receiving so many positive reviews. I'm on firmware v01.08.62 which reading through the posts does appear to be a backwards step but given its new I've got nothing to compare it against all I can say is that it's ""Dumb"".

It will tap a wall with plenty of space either side and will just get stuck, it's struggles to navigate 90degree corners again even when there is plenty of space. Carpet is medium pile, no rugs or obstacles that should cause issues but what appears to be a lack of ""intelligence'. Now, once it does become stuck if I push either the left or right hand side of the bumper bar and every so lightly push it will circle round and in some cases back to the same position and become stuck again.

Question is - is this a firmware issue, user issue or hardware? are other people experiencing similar problems?

At present this robovac is next to useless if I have to continually move it myself."
"Between s5 and s5 maxhello,

trying to buy my first robot vacuum for my house. I have narrowed it down to between s5 and s5 max. Any advice on which one I should buy? I honestly do not need mopping that much, so the size of the watertank would not be an issue.

I am currently seeing the price of s5 at $479.99 and s5 max at $549.99 on Amazon.

Also, is there any other website I can purchase the product besides amazon?

Any suggestion would greatly be appreciated. Thanks"
"Want a new robot. Between s5 max or s6 pure?Im really tempted with the s6 pure. It's on sale for 360.

S5 max I think the cheapest I've seen it is 480 new and 350 ""renewed"".

My budget is less than 400 (maybe slightly higher if a big difference). I have 1200 sqft apartment with a heavy shedding small pug, hardwood floors and a few carpets.

Honestly my wife is telling me ""we don't need one"" but these things are so damn cool.... I own a 4 year old iLife which I never used since it was just bad it would just roll around in the same area for 2 hours and I had to basically drag it around the apartment to get it to clean anywhere except my living room.

I don't have much experience with ""renewed"", Amazon sells a 60 dollar extended warranty which might be worth it if I do end up buying a refurbished unit.


What do you people think?"
"Mopping with the S6 MaxV: Do you mark off areas or just let it go?We recently got a 6 MaxV and love it. I got a good deal on a refurb direct from Roborock. It came like-new, but they included the wrong mopping attachment. The correct one is arriving tomorrow and I’m pretty excited to see how it goes. I was bummed to find out the cameras and sensors don’t detect carpet (I kinda just figured it did before purchasing). I don’t mind the idea of setting up no-mop zones, but honestly I really just love the current setup of letting it go nuts with cleaning the house everyday.

Does anyone here just ignore the no-mop zones and let it run on tile and carpet? If so what are your experiences with it? I don’t mind if the carpet gets slightly damp, but I wouldn’t want the robot soaking it and causing issues with possible mildew or discoloration, or the mop dragging on carpet causing the battery on the robot to drain a lot quicker when in use.

The carpet and mop retraction is the top new addition on the S7 for me, but I love the cameras on the MaxV, so I wouldn’t hop into the next generation until a max version arrives."
"best robot vacuum for non-tech peopleI have the S6 which I really like. My wife wants to get a Robovac for her parents who are not tech savvy, I don't think a Roborock is a good choice because you kind of really need to rely on the app to get the full use of it. I honestly don't think they would even like it or use it. Does anyone know of a robovac that is as good but more of a set it and forget it- Roomba?"
"S6 MaxV vs S7Hey guys!
I have been looking for my first vacuum cleaner robot few months. I was really sure to buy S6 MaxV, but everyone told me to wait for S7. Now it’s time for decision. 
At the beginning, what I really need. I don’t have a huge flat. Mostly wooden floor without carpets. Have two dogs and still no kids. 
When I take two vacuum to compare them, for me the winner is S6 MaxV.
Maybe I start about S7. That’s right, new mopping system. Surely it’s a nice advantage, but honestly I don’t need to clean so hard my floor every time. When I see a stain or something spills, then I take a mop an the problem is over. A self cleaning station is also a good advantage, but it’s still a render. We don’t know when it would be available. Maybe 2 moths, maybe 1 year. Now time for bad side. 
Honestly, it’s a kind of step back, camera certainly is the best solution for many problem. Mainly when you have dogs, kids or many cables. It was a huge step to future and good AI system. I completely don’t understand why S7 doesn’t have camera in. Due to this reason, for me S7 is a better S6. For me the decision is over. 
I will take S6 MaxV which is cheaper now and waiting for S7 MaxV which probably would have camera, good mopping system and finally the station would be available:)"

Slight problem is it snags on high pile throw rug corners though it can fix itself without assistance and it can't fit under the cabinets in the kitchen (just barely too tall).

The bumper height is precisely 3 inches and there's an IR sensor in the front center that is at 3.5 inches.  It's probably 0.1 inches too tall on the bumpers.  Honestly.  2 or 3 mm shorter would do it.  I'm tempted to shave off the top edge of the S9 - there's a tall edge - though I'm not sure if the VSLAM relies on it.

I'm considering exchanging it for the S6 or S6Max V.  What is the height clearance for running along the edge of cabinets.  I believe this would discount the LIDAR.  The height I've seen discussed are about furniture clearance which includes the LIDAR.

I'm also open to suggestions.  No-go zones, single floor, room selection, mostly hardwood with a few throw rugs are the most important factors for me.  Object avoidance isn't terribly relevant."
