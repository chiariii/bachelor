"Best Robovac For Pet Hair RedditBest robot vacuum for pet hair self-emptying reddit 2020.

We are smart and love smart way of living.We clean our place with vacuum robot now.It is with Echo connected capability & suitable mobile app. This type of vacuum is shorter in height with 25% more suction, which is great, but the suction comes at a price. Battery run-time is 45 mins on max-suction. With that said, have literally stopped manually vacuuming, it works that good. Has exceeded expectations. As I say in the title, a great product that performs as good as the competition for half the price. Loved by experts in Reddit communities.

"iRobot Roomba E5 Vs Tesvor Robot Vacuum RedditBest robot vacuum for hardwood floors Carpet and pet hair 2020 reddit. These are top rated mapping technology vacuum robots. 

Tesvor vs irobot

Both robots support the time scheduling function. **Tesvor** X500 is more powerful - 1500 pa **versus** 1000 pa that **iRobot Roomba** 877 has. X500 also has a bigger dustbin – 600 ml, while **Roomba's** dustbin is 300 ml. **Tesvor** X500 wins with its 1600 square feet when **Roomba** 877 can clean an area of 1000 square feet.

We own and use a Roomba e5 robot vacuum cleaner (nicknamed “Tobor”) at our vacation home. We decided it was time to purchase a second vac for use in our principal home. We have been quite satisfied with the e5 but decided to search for a less well known vacuum in the same general price point, hopefully with more features.  
The Tesvor M1 was our choice. (Of course, it also deserved a nickname: “Alfred”.)  
This has given us the opportunity to compare the highly regarded Roomba e5 with the Tesvor which seems better known in Germany and Europe. Both are manufactured in Asia.  


Here are our findings:  
1. The Tesvor has superior “smart” mapping function that addresses each area of the home by creating grid patterns, much as one would do in mowing the yard. If an area is entirely open the virtual areas are limited to about 12’x12’. Obstructions within the area are effectively worked around. Once an area has been “mowed”, the Tesvor “maps” an adjoining area and continues in this manner until either it “thinks” there is nothing further, or the battery is below 20%. “Areas” and “grids” make for more efficient cleaning. The Roomba operates randomly, frequently covering the same area twice, and continues until it requires charging.  
2. The Tesvor and Roomba have approximately the same suction in normal mode. However, the Tesvor has two higher power options that are significantly stronger than what is offered by the Roomba. The Tesvor also has a quiet mode, but with reduced suction. Tesvor’s normal power is sufficient for most cleaning tasks. The higher power modes are appropriate for spot cleaning and any especially difficult task.  
3. The Roomba lacks the stamina of the Tesvor. Less than 90 minutes vs nearly 2 hours before each searches for “home” and a charge. Each will seek out its base when there is between 10-20% charge remaining, but the Tesvor turns off suction, thus further extending battery life as it seeks “home”.  
4. Both vacuums are competent cleaners. The dirt bin in the Tesvor is slightly larger than the Roomba. Both dirt bins are easily accessible and feature HEPA filters.  
5. In normal modes the Roomba is the quieter of the two. Tesvor’s higher power modes are significantly louder. We prefer to use both vacuums at night when they do not interfere with our household activities.  
6. The Tesvor offers an optional water tank as a post-purchase option that provides it with a mopping function typically available only on higher priced vacs. We have not tested that option.  
7. Each links to one’s smartphone through an app and provide basic information on the robot’s status. The Tesvor takes this a step farther by providing a real-time progress map. I have attached a screen-shot of the Tesvor’s cleaning of my home office. The open area in the center is my conference table which has a solid pedestal base and chairs on 4 sides. The Tesvor also provides a remote control. I prefer the app.  
8. The Tesvor is approximately an inch shorter in profile and thus has access to some areas that are not available to the Roomba.  
9. The Roomba’s handle is a nice convenience feature that we miss on the Tesvor.  
10. Both units seem well constructed and engineered. The Tesvor has 2 rotating side brushes, the Roomba only one. We like the unique brushless center counter-rotating pickup bars on the Roomba as these seem less likely to become tangled by long hair. The Tesvor’s center single rotating bar combines conventional bristles with rubber “vanes”. We can’t discern any real difference in cleaning effectiveness. Both systems are easily owner serviced.  


In summary: Both vacuums are competent cleaners. However, the Tesvor offers features and strengths that are typically available only at a higher price point. Our nod goes to the Tesvor.

House dust, pollen or pet hair allergy – a well-known disease

Thousands of people are allergic to house dust, pollen or animal hair. Allergens are mainly absorbed via the respiratory tract, which can lead to almost endless sneezing attacks, watery eyes and irritation of the mucous membranes. It is particularly important for allergy sufferers that as few allergens as possible are present in the living rooms. And who would have thought that exactly a robot vacuum could help allergy sufferers?

Robot vacuum with HEPA filter

Anyone looking for the best vacuum cleaner for allergies should definitely look for a robot vacuum with HEPA filter. HEPA filters are special “High Efficiency Particulate Air-filters” that filter up to 99 % of allergens out of the air. A real blessing for allergy sufferers! Especially important when using a HEPA filter vacuum robot: The filter must be cleaned regularly and thoroughly so that it delivers full performance. Furthermore, the filter should be replaced by a new one after some time."
"iRobot Roomba i7+ Vs Shark IQ Reddit The main differences between **Shark IQ** and **Roomba i7+** are: The **Shark IQ** self-emptying dustbin doesn't need a bag, but the **Roomba i7+** does. The **Shark IQ** canister has a viewing window so you can tell when it's full, but the **Roomba i7+** canister is a lot larger and can hold more debris for less frequent emptying. 

 BOTTOM LINE: If you're only cleaning hardwoods, the lower-priced **Shark IQ** would definitely be the **better** deal, but for large debris cleaning for floor plans with variable floor types (especially carpet), **Roomba** excels. The i7+ and S9+ take the cake for carpet cleaning performance.
