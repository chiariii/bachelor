"Are Affordable Robot Vacuums worth it? What are the best Affordable Robot Vacuums on the market in 2021?ÔªøThe purpose of this article is to determine what is the best pound-for-pound Robot Vacuum on the market in 2021. With models now available for under $50, a Robot-Vacuum will soon feature as a regular part of every home. As with coffee machines and smartphones, the technology has evolved to make this a reality, at very low prices.

If a robot vacuum cleaner can take care of your vacuuming work, you can increase your time for important things over weekends and free up several hours per month of backbreaking labour.

Historically, Robot Vacuums have sold for hundreds of dollars on Amazon or Ebay, if not thousands. However as we approach 2022, we can safely say that the engines for even the most affordable models now get the job done. ¬†

Yes, Robot Vacuums are truly and fully worth a small investment, now costing less than a takeaway dinner for two.

At the push of a button, current models of Robot Vacuum Cleaners can indeed reliably clean the majority of hard floor types and carpets. Whether for small or large homes, for pet owners or allergy sufferers, with app control or connection to Amazon Alexa - you can now definitely find a suitable robot vacuum cleaner for your home at a VERY affordable price.

üì∑

My initial concern was in truth: ‚Äúwhy are they so cheap now!?‚Äù ‚ÄúWill they really work for this price, and can they last?‚Äù After my initial tests, I was thoroughly impressed with even the most affordable models. It dawned on me that long gone are the days when these devices were seen in the pages of science fiction¬†magazines, or Jetsons-styled, futuristic homes. Current models boast of features like sophisticated sensors, CPUs, lasers, built-in humidifiers, AI - enhanced navigation software, and self-emptying hardware! When looking for value as a key criteria for a vacuum cleaner, some of these options are unnecessary, and can drive up the price by hundreds, for very little additional value (see - self emptying versions).¬†

 üì∑

As cool as they seem, the robotic vacuum cleaners most popularly advertised can cost as much as four figures, especially new self-emptying models. While you don't have to spend nearly that much nowadays for a core model vacuum, you can get a lot in return. Once again, it is safe to say that even the most affordable models can get the job done, which hasn‚Äôt always been the case. Think smartphones, and the evolution of cheaper rivals which are now outperforming those more expensive versions of the recent past.

To narrow down the list of the best affordable, pound-for-pound robot vacuum, I spent over 100 hours testing a group of 15 robotic cleaning vacuums priced under $50. My key criteria were as follows:

* Overall Design
* Battery Life
* Suction Power

**Overall Design:** For this criteria, I took into account the various functions offered, its‚Äô sleekness and ability to navigate tight areas, and what additional functions are included (i.e. does it have an app? A UV cleaning light for antibacterial cleansing?) Most importantly, with all things combined, this seeks to understand if it ‚Äúgets the job done.‚Äù I was frankly amazed at the results for the cost of these devices ‚Äì all for under $50 USD, with some costing less than half that amount.

**Battery Life:** This one is simple ‚Äì how long does the vacuum last while automatically cleaning your home? No different from smartphones, one needs to test the reliability of battery power for each model. The current industry standard as of 2021 appears to be 90minutes.

**Suction power:** my starting point was the stated PA (Pascal) strength of each model. Pa, or Pascal, is the unit of measurement used to gauge atmospheric pressure, or, in other words, how much the robot sucks (in a good way). The higher the Pa rating, the more powerful the suction. For bare floors, a 500- or 600-Pa robot will suffice, although a higher Pa rating will ensure that the robot picks up tiny specks of dust from tile ground and in between floorboards. The recommend level is at least 800 Pa for exclusive bare floor homes.

The Robot Vacuums recommended on robot-heaven.com range from 1800PA-3500PA so as to ensure your vacuum provides real cleaning value for years to come. Among them are brand-new models that have recently launched across thousands of online retailers.

I excluded older models that likely won't be sold for much longer. I'll continue to update this blog and list periodically as new models hit the market. My recommended models are shown in the link below.

"Neato D4 (BNIB, 260 USD) vs. Deebot 900 (Refurb, 160 USD)?I am living in Canada, and caught the last-minute deal of Neato D4, **brand-new**, for **260 USD**.

Meanwhile I found a deal on Buydig which sells the **refurbished** Deebot 900 for **160 USD**.

* Both vacs adopt LDS which I appreciate.
* I heard Neato do stronger suction than Deebot.
* Deebot 900 has the side brush; Neato D4 depends only on its D-shape.
* Neato comes with the 1-year manufacturer's warranty, and I can easily return it to the nearest BestBuy if I don't like it; Deebot with the 2-year seller's warranty, although I am not sure whether the shipping fee is reimbursed if I want to return the Deebot. Actually, very unlikely since the Deebot is shipped from the U.S. to Canada using FedEx.
* Both price tags include tax, import charges, and shipping.
* I am living alone **with my cat**, at a 1BR condo, **450 sq.ft.**

Based on the description above, is Neato D4 worth extra 100 bucks over Deebot 900?"

"[Question] Good robot vacuum without InternetFor a long time now, I've been looing for a looking for a new robot vacuum. All the latest premium cleaners seem to come with a mandatory online account and a companion app. I don't mind the app, as long as it's WLAN/LAN only, but I don't see the necessity for a cloud account to control something thats only in my house.

Do you know of any good (as in good cleaning performance, good obstacle avoidance, etc.) robot vacuum that can be used without a cloud account?"

I just bought this ihome vacuum and it‚Äôs giving me ‚ÄúStuck edge fault ‚Äú can anyone please help me fix it üò©
"Recommendation for a robotHello everyone, 

I have a iRobot series 800 (can‚Äôt remember the actual model number, but it has a few years under its belt) and we just moved to a new home and there‚Äôs a small ‚Äústep‚Äù between the living too, and the kitchen. It‚Äôs about 1 cm tall. The robot has no issues going down, but most times doesn‚Äôt manage to go up. 
So, I‚Äôm looking for a new robot (available in Europe) or a suggestion to help it go up.
I saw the Dyson can go up taller carpets and so, but reviews are mixed and the thing is quite expensive‚Ä¶
Any ideas?
Thank you"
"Main brush problemHey guys, mine is iSweep X3,

Mais brush is too weak to keep rolling, cleaned it up and kept crashing..

Bought new motor and battery, replaced, main brush doesn't even try to roll....

When testing motor alone (all attachments disassembled) it rolls and seems pretty strong... When I assemble the belt drive (no brush yet), it won't start rolling... (New motor, so all new)

Could it be that the electronics are sending too low of a voltage?

Thanks for your help"
Midea M7 Pro Vacuum CleanerHello i have a problem. I just bought this robot and the first time i asked him to clean the whole house and do a map he did not complete it and ended up going to charge. I tried again creating another map but same issue. I tried to reset it from app and from the device reset button but no luck. Now it is even not cleaning whole boxes i instruct it to clean via app. It is doing a triangle and says it is ready and goes back to charge. It has a full battery so it for sure has enough charge. Anyone can help sort this out?
"Help Us Vacuum Peeps, You're Our Only Hope Hey all! Looking for some assistance here. My wife and I are looking for a robot vacuum. Duh, right? I'm clearly in the proper place.

We were taking a look at the Shark IQ who's website has been down for 2 days now, making us worry about the product, and it's apparently near impossible to get parts in Canada. The true north strong and dusty, am I right?  
Also peeked at the Roomba i7 as it was able to pick up from where it left off, if it needed to charge before finishing, but had concerns about all the reviews saying it had issue getting back into its charging dock.

So we're stuck. We want something that will cover our home. We have 1,500 square feet, 1 floor, all hard flooring, and two doggos who shed like there's no tomorrow.  
We do need mapping so the vacuum doesn't get lost, and we're looking for something that won't need to run into things to know they're there.  
We **don't** need it to have the self empty bit. Yeah, it's cool but we can handle it.

Our hearts do break that Roborock doesn't ship to Canada, otherwise we wouldn't be asking for assistance, or looking at the Shark or Roomba."
"I need help finding a vacuum with mapping that I can pickup and place in a room. (I have gates in my house)Hey everyone I have 2 gates in my house that completely block off a section of my house to keep my dogs off of our nice couch in the den and keep them out of the kitchen.  I would like to find a robotic vacuum that I can have map out the house with the gates down then be able to put the gates back up.  I would then like to be able to select the rooms that are gated off and take the vacuum to those rooms and have them do the vacuum cycle for those rooms.  

&#x200B;

Can any of the vacuums with Lidar mapping accommodate this?  Is the roomba i7 the only robotic vacuum cleaner that can learn multiple floor plans?  I guess with the i7 I could have it learn the part of the house that is blocked off separately from the main floor plan since it can learn multiple levels for a multi floor house.

&#x200B;

Has anyone had luck with building ramps that can let robotic vacuums go over baby gates?

&#x200B;

Ideally I would like to be able to buy a lower cost mapping robotic vacuum like ECOVACS DEEBOT 907 which costs only $300 at costco"
"Cybersecurity concerns with Robot Vacuums?Hello r/RobotVacuumCleaners!

Full disclosure - this is for a school assignment, where my group and I did the research, made assumptions, and now have to validate it with cybersecurity experts and people in the industry (of home robotics, like robot vacuums). Unfortunately, I haven't been hearing back from the startups and other big companies in the industry, so I'm here to ask for your thoughts & help on the matter!

Basically, cybersecurity vulnerabilities in robot vacuums have been demonstrated by researchers. But do consumers actually care? Like, would you not buy a robot vacuum, for example, because of cybersecurity concerns?

I personally own a Roomba, but it's the old model that doesn't connect to Wi-Fi. I'd have no problems with getting the new versions that do, though, since I'm not too worried about the data it can collect, like the floor plan of my house. Although I guess I'd be more concerned if they can be hacked to push stuff off the stairs or something. Maybe it's because the consequences of a hacked robot vacuum doesn't seem that big?

What are your thoughts on the matter?

P.S. If you happen to work at a company that manufactures robots, or a or at a cybersecurity company (or you happen to have any expertise on the matter of cybersecurity for home robots), please, please, please, DM me, I would love to gain some of your insights on the topic!!"
"Tip for fixing ""dirty sensor"" error (bumper)TL;DR: everyone should own a headlight restoration kit for $20, and they will clear up a scratched bumper if your robovac can't ""see"".

Wanted to pass along a maintenance tip. I have a Eufy 11+ that works wonders, but lately it's been having a lot of ""dirty sensor"" errors, spending most of its time in a small area like it thought it was bumping into things. Cleaned it up and down, still a problem. 

A few years ago I bought a headlight restoration kit (Meguiar's I think? Maybe 3M?) for like $20 that keeps coming in handy for polishing stuff and I gave it a shot on the bumper. It worked great. Got out all but the deepest scratches, you can see through the clear part of the bumper again, and Eufy is off to the races.

If anyone isn't familiar with these kits, they can be found on Amazon, any auto parts store, Wal-Mart, etc. They usually including a few different grades of sanding pads, a buffing pad, and polishing compound. You can gather these materials yourself if you want, the kit just makes it easy. They usually require that you own some sort of basic drill, but there are kits that don't. 

Hope this helps someone else."
"Is there a robot vacuum that works on carpeted flooring?I'm a total noob when it comes to robotic vacuums so any help is appreciated. I love the thought of having the house swept every day, but can't seem to find one that works on carpet. Our main floor is split between laminate and a shorter shag style carpet. Is there anything out there?"
"Robot vacuum cleaner for 5-dogs house and ability to clean wet floorsHello!

I have an house with 5 dogs (some of which shed a bit of fur), and i'm looking for a robot that can clean whatever fur/mud/dirt that gets taken from the garden into the house (and that can last a few years doing its job).

I also need it to be able to withstand vacuuming liquids. One of the dogs is old and has incontinence problems from time to time.

What i'm asking is if there is anything that i can buy that can work in these conditions and not get destroyed after a few months of usage. My budget is obviously in the high range if there is such a sturdy device available.

Thank you for your help! "
