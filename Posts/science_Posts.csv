For the past two decades, I’ve been fascinated by how, when, and why emotions shape our decisions, especially those that have to do with vice and virtue. Whether we’re examining hypocrisy and compassion, pride and punishment, cheating and trust, my research group’s work continually shows that human moral behavior is much more variable than most would predict.

One of my primary goals is to figure out how to leverage emotion-based mechanisms of the mind to help individuals make better decisions and, hopefully along the way, to nudge the greater good. Along those lines, here’s info about some of my most recent work.

"I’m Rana el Kaliouby, Host of NOVA Wonders & CEO of Affectiva. Ask me anything!With AI becoming mainstream, how will it affect the way we interact with our devices and how we communicate with each other?



My name is Rana el Kaliouby, and I’m an Egyptian-American scientist and entrepreneur on a mission to humanize technology. I care deeply about ethics and trust in AI, from considering algorithmic bias to ensuring consent and data privacy. As Co-founder and CEO of Affectiva, an MIT spin-off that builds artificial emotional intelligence (“Emotion AI”), my company uses cutting-edge software that analyzes complex and nuanced emotional and cognitive states from the human face and voice, ultimately engineering empathy. For me, teaching machines to measure and interpret human emotions has the potential to enhance consumer experiences, engage students and personalize their learning, allow doctors and nurses to deliver better care, increase road safety by tracking driver alertness, and enable people with autism to better communicate with their families and peers.



I consider myself a role-model for young scientists who are considering careers in technology and entrepreneurship. As a female Muslim scientist who’s one of a handful of women CEOs in the tech industry, I’m a huge advocate for diversity and inclusion–– not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the only way we can design and build smart technologies for an increasingly global world.



Today, I’m also a co-host on PBS NOVA’s new series “NOVA Wonders,” in which incredible scientists from all walks of life tackle some of the biggest questions about life and the cosmos. I believe that science is the vehicle for innovation, so I’m truly excited to be a part of “NOVA Wonders”–– I especially love how NOVA shows that scientists come in all shapes, colors and sizes, thus providing diverse role-models that aspiring scientists can relate to and be encouraged by.



I’m a World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leader and I served on WEF’s Global Future Council on AI and Robotics. I’m also a member of the Partnership on AI, which is concerned with ensuring that AI benefits society and is applied for good. A former research scientist at the MIT Media Lab with a PhD in computer vision and machine learning from the University of Cambridge, I use my voice to advocate for women in tech and for beneficial uses of AI–– I’m often cited in and interviewed by top business and mainstream outlets, including The New Yorker, Wired, Forbes, Fast Company, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and TIME Magazine.

AMA!We are SynTouch: the world leader in the technology of human touch. We invented the only sensor in the world that endows machines with the ability to replicate the human sense of touch. We call this emerging field Machine Touch. Like machine vision, it requires a combination of sensors and algorithms to take a human sense, capture it and allow us to do useful things with tactile information.


One core application of our technology is quantifying dimensions of touch - we’ve created a taxonomy called the SynTouch Standard® that consists of fifteen dimensions humans feel. The information is captured by our BioTac Toccare® which Automakers, Apparel and Consumer Electronics companies use to define and improve the haptics of their products. Analogous to the use of digital color meters to capture RGB values and drive product manufacturing decisions to ensure they ‘look right’, our technology provides information to ensure products ‘feel right’.


Our technology also functions as the input for haptic displays for VR and telerobotics. This allows us to drive haptic displays with real-world data for anything from a surgical robot to a gaming device – and we’ve worked with both!


We’re also pursuing long-term projects to command robotic hands with tactile sense and reflexes. Our sensors allow robot hands to handle fragile objects better than currently available systems – one prime use case that we’re pursing now deploying this technology in prosthetics to allow amputees to handle fragile objects without dropping or crushing them. 


SynTouch was founded in 2008 by Professor Gerald Loeb, and Ph.D. students Matthew Borzage, Jeremy Fishel, and Nicholas Wettels who were at the University of Southern California. We’ve been recognized by Popular Mechanics, The Robot Report, and the World Economic Forum…

"Science AMA Series: I’m the MIT computer scientist who created a Twitterbot that uses AI to sound like Donald Trump. During the day, I work on human-robot collaboration. AMA!Hi reddit! My name is [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info) and I’m a postdoctoral associate at MIT’s [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) interested in building autonomous robots that can learn from, communicate with, and collaborate with humans.


My research at MIT CSAIL involves developing and evaluating algorithms that enable robots to become capable teammates, empowering human co-workers to be safer, more proficient, and more efficient at their jobs.


Back in March I also created [@DeepDrumpf](http://twitter.com/deepdrumpf), a Twitter account that sounds like Donald Trump using an algorithm I trained with dozens of hours of speech transcripts. (The handle has since picked up nearly 28,000 followers)


Some Tweet highlights:

DeepDrumpf’s algorithm is based around what’s called “deep learning,” which describes a family of techniques within artificial intelligence and machine learning that allows computers to to learn patterns from data on their own. 


It creates Tweets one letter at a time, based on what letters are most likely to follow each other. For example, if it randomly began its Tweet with the letter “D,” it is somewhat likely to be followed by an “R,” and then a “A,” and so on until the bot types out Trump’s latest catchphrase, “Drain the Swamp.” It then starts over for the next sentence and repeats that process until it reaches 140 characters.


The basis of my approach is similar to [existing work](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) that [can simulate Shakespeare](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/shakespear.txt).

"I am Dr. Dante Lauretta, I study the chemistry of our solar system, extrasolar systems, and am building a robot to visit an asteroid and return a sample to Earth – the OSIRIS-REx NASA Mission, AMA!I’m Dante Lauretta, professor of Planetary Sciences at the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu/). I study the chemistry of planetary materials in our solar system and those around other stars. I am interested in the chemistry and mineralogy of asteroids and comets. I study these objects using planet formation theories, meteorite analysis, and spacecraft missions. 

I am in charge of NASA’s [OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission](http://www.asteroidmission.org) as Principal Investigator. OSIRIS-REx is a space mission to visit asteroid [Bennu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu), one of the most potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids. OSIRIS-REx will survey Bennu to assess its impact hazard and resource potential, understand its geology, and return a sample to Earth. We launch in 2016, rendezvous with Bennu in 2018, and return to Earth in 2023.  

I’m here at 1 PM EDT to answer your questions about solar and extrasolar system formation, asteroids, comets, meteorites, and what it’s like being in charge of a NASA Mission. 

Also, I invite everyone to send your name into space on the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft through our [Messages to Bennu](http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/messages/bennu/) campaign. Feel free to check out my blog [Life on the Asteroid Frontier](http://dslauretta.com/) as well!

**Edit** Thanks for the great AMA. I have to get back to work but will keep answering your questions throughout the day!

**Edit#2** Thanks for the continued interest! I am going out for a beer but will answer your questions when I get back - they may get more interesting after that . . .

**Edit#3** Answers to FAQs:

- What do I think about asteroid mining?

Asteroids like Bennu represent natural resources of near-Earth space, in the form of water, organics, and precious metals. There is potential for substantial economic development in follow-on exploration of these objects. Water and organics are useful for life support and rocket fuel and therefore would support a space-faring economy. The current business model for asteroid mining relies on a steady customer base for resources such as water and organic compounds in space. Such a venture may be feasible if international interest in space exploration continues to increase. Another angle on asteroid mining is to extract precious metals like platinum and return them to Earth. I calculate that a 10-meter asteroid is worth ~$10-million, with $9M in iron, nickel, and cobalt and $1M worth of platinum. Given that OSIRIS-REx costs $1-billion, we have long way to go before this business plan closes. What we really need to do is bring down the cost of accessing space. 


There are a couple of companies that are interested in asteroid mining and they are looking for talented people. If you are interested, they are hiring.

- What are the chances of finding a harmful bacteria/virus in the sample?

We consider this to be a very low probability event. We don’t expect any microorganisms on Bennu. It is too small and the radiation doses would kill anything living on the asteroid in a very short time. We had to prove this as part of our Planetary Protection rating – which is Unrestricted Earth Return - meaning that we do not have to take any special precautions to avoid contaminating the Earth with extraterrestrial life. Instead, we hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth. We will focus on measuring the organic molecular inventory of the samples but don’t have any plans for biological assays. We will keep the sample under nitrogen purge to avoid contaminating it with terrestrial microbes.

- How do I get a job in planetary science or working on a spacecraft mission?

I  describe my initial steps in my [Journey to the Asteroid Frontier - Part 1](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/06/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-1/) in one of my blog posts with a follow on in [Part 2](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/17/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-2/). I was introduced to planetary science as an undergraduate at the University of Arizona when I received a NASA Undergraduate Research Space Grant to work on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The idea of communicating with an alien civilization across the vast expanse of space inspired me to pursue a career in planetary science. I focus on the formation of planets and the origin of life to understand the likelihood of alien life arising and evolving elsewhere in our universe.

As for young people wanting to get into this line of work - study hard and do well in school. Graduate high school and go to college. Find people with similar interests. Start with the basics – math and physics, then work your way up from there. Planetary science is multidisciplinary and requires knowledge of math, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, etc. Once in college, he should try to get a job in a research lab. Talk to scientists and engineers that are working on projects that interest and find ways to volunteer in their labs. Undergraduate research opportunities are key to getting needed experience for a job in the aerospace industry or for getting into a good graduate school. Be persistent, arrange for tours of local labs, and make it clear that you are interested and motivated to pursue a career in this field. Once you get the job, do it well and show initiative to move up to more responsibility.

I am optimistic about the future of space exploration for several reasons. First, despite budget cuts in recent years, the United States has a great space program with many exciting missions in the future including Mars 2020, the Europa Clipper, and, of course, OSIRIS-REx. In addition, other national space agencies are ramping up their programs including India, China, Russia, and the Europeans. Finally, I think we are starting to see some serious interest from industry in commercial development of space. If these companies take off then planetary scientists will be in high demand.

- What powers and propels OSIRIS-REx towards Bennu and how fast does it travel?

We have two solar arrays to provide power to the spacecraft. We have two Li-ion batteries to store power for periods when we are not in direct sunlight (such as during launch and sampling). The guidance system includes many components including star trackers, sun sensors, a laser range-finder, and on-board image processing capabilities. 
I describe the journey to Bennu, including details on the speeds involved in my blog post [How to Get to Bennu and Back](http://dslauretta.com/2013/11/27/how-to-get-to-bennu-and-back/). We will leave Earth with a hyperbolic escape velocity of 5.4 km/s (over 12,000 mph) on an Atlas V rocket. We will sneak up on Bennu with a relative approach velocity of 20 cm/s (~0.45 mph). When we return to Earth the sample return capsule will hit the top of the atmosphere with a speed of 12.4 km/s (27,738 mph). 

- How much sample will we collect, what do we hope to find in the asteroid sample and how will we analyze it?

The baseline science requirement is 60 grams (about 2 ounces) of asteroid regolith. However, we also have to be able to measure the amount of sample collected before we stow the sample collector in the return capsule. We measure the moment of inertia of the spacecraft both before and after sample acquisition. It turns out that this technique has a measurement uncertainty of 90 grams (3-sigma). Therefore, our sample collector (TAGSAM) is required to pick up 150 grams of material. Under optimum conditions, TAGSAM can pick up two kilograms of material. We have the capability to attempt sample collection three times. However, we hope to get enough sample on the first attempt. The second two are backup options in case the first attempt does not pick up enough material. 

The primary objective of OSIRIS-REx is to return pristine carbonaceous material from the early Solar System. Spectral analysis of Bennu suggests that it is similar on composition to the very rare CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. These rocks are rich in organic compounds and water-bearing minerals like clays. We hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth and inform the likelihood that life may have originated elsewhere in our solar system. The team’s sample analysis objectives are distributed among five broad categories, based on analytical techniques. These are: mineralogy & petrology, elemental & isotopic composition, organic chemistry, spectral properties, and thermal properties. We use a wide variety of techniques including NanoSIMS, transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, mass spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, synchrotron particle accelerators, thermal conductivity analyzers, and laboratory spectrometers.

SynTouch started with the goal of endowing robotic hands with the ability to perform human-like capabilities: the identification, and manipulation of objects to perform useful tasks. The existence proof that such capabilities are possible is the human hand. We practice biomimetic design and have learned from the human hand what tactile information is useful. This required understanding the sensing capabilities of a human finger: detecting deformations, vibrations, and thermal gradients. It also required an appreciation of the mechanical features of a human fingertip: the shape of the bone, compliance of the skin, presence of fingerprints. These seemingly unimportant features of a human fingertip are all critical for the identification and manipulation of objects. Combining these in a package that is robust and field serviceable led us to develop the BioTac®.

Jumping forward to 2014 we're at the forefront of Machine Touch®; we build our BioTac sensors, and program robots with the intelligence to move them and process the resulting data. We've used BioTacs to enhance prosthetics by creating tactile reflexes, integrated them with a dozen types of dexterous robotic hands, helped international companies determine how their products feel, and sold our sensors to researchers in labs around the world.

We look forward to answering your questions about robots, prosthetics, engineering startups, and the sense of touch. AMA!

"Science AMA Series: I’m Jessy Grizzle, the inaugural Director of Robotics at the University of Michigan. My group produces some of the world’s most advanced algorithms that allow bipedal robots to walk over uneven terrain. AMA!Hi reddit!

My group, the Dynamic Legged Locomotion Laboratory, is best known for two walking robots: MABEL and MARLO. Two of my outstanding graduate students, Xingye “Dennis” Da and Ross Hartley, will be helping me out with questions about MARLO today. Here’s our lab’s YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/DynamicLegLocomotion 

MARLO, our current robot, is capable of walking without support in any direction (3D walking). We take it over some of the most challenging terrain we can find. It falls, it breaks; we order new parts, improve our algorithms, and go out again. We’ve managed to walk down steep hills, through woodland, and most recently, we’ve seen early success on the Wave Field - a field covered with grassy mounds that are about three feet high. Here’s a playlist of MARLO experiments: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFe0SMV3hBCDPEEhG0iLEvXVpfQsq_NdS 

MABEL, MARLO’s predecessor, was capable of 2D walking (in circles, attached to a boom). It could recover from trips and walk up and down obstacles in its way. MABEL is most famous for running at a pace equivalent to a 9-minute mile. We took what we learned in 2D walking with MABEL and applied it to MARLO. Here’s a playlist of MABEL experiments. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFe0SMV3hBCDseftwp7X0Wmi2halvfr3H 

MABEL and MARLO are underactuated robots - they don’t have control over every joint. For instance, MARLO’s feet swing freely from its ankles. This makes our algorithms applicable to more robots, including those that have actuated ankles.

They can also provide a basis for robotic prosthetics. One of our collaborators, Bobby Gregg at the University of Texas, Dallas, develops prosthetic legs for humans. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl1IXs0j4Ww 

But robotics is much more than walking robots. My colleagues at Michigan work on projects such as drones that communicate to avoid collisions, autonomous underwater robots, robots that help people recover from injuries and surgeries, the next generation of robots in factories and, of course, driverless cars. If there is enough interest in the Reddit community, we may be able to recruit some of these experts for future AMAs! More about the Robotics Institute here: http://robotics.umich.edu/

"Science AMA Series: I am Dr. Stephen L. Hoffman, my company developed an effective Malaria Vaccine. We’ve partnered with Harvard to work to provide the vaccine at the lowest cost possible to the World’s poorest and most underserved. AMA!My name is [Stephen L. Hoffman](http://www.sanaria.com/index.php?s=44).  I am the CEO and Chief Scientific Officer at Sanaria Inc. a small biotech company in Rockville, Maryland.  I was the Director of the Malaria Program at the Naval Medical Research Center and later the Senior Vice President of Biologics at Celera Genomics. I then founded Sanaria with my wife, B. Kim Lee Sim. 

Our team is working towards the goal of producing the first malaria vaccine capable of eliminating malaria. To produce our vaccine, we grow the parasites in mosquitoes, irradiate the mosquitoes, and hand-dissect the mosquito salivary glands. The salivary glands contain malaria parasites called sporozoites, which comprise our vaccine.  After purifying and vialing the sporozoites, the vaccine is ready to go. 
 
Last year, [during a clinical trial of our PfSPZ Vaccine](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1359.abstract), we demonstrated our malaria vaccine protected all subjects of one group against malaria, a first for any malaria vaccine candidate.  If you do not have access to Science, you can read about our paper in the [Scientific American article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zapped-malaria-parasite-raises-vaccine-hopes/).  We are running a multitude of clinical trials in an effort to further refining the dosing regimen and move our product towards licensure. 
 
We currently successfully and rapidly dissect each mosquito by hand, but this a tedious, time consuming, and laborious process. In order to be able to optimally scale-up the manufacturing process,  we recently partnered with the Harvard BioRobotics Lab to develop a mosquito-dissecting robot named SporoBot.  You can find more about our crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for SporoBot [here](http://www.sporobot.com/). Please contribute and help us develop a robot that will manufacture our highly effective malaria vaccine at the lowest possible cost for the World’s poorest and most underserved.

"Science AMA Series: I’m the MIT computer scientist who created a Twitterbot that uses AI to sound like Donald Trump. During the day, I work on human-robot collaboration. AMA!Hi reddit! My name is [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info) and I’m a postdoctoral associate at MIT’s [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) interested in building autonomous robots that can learn from, communicate with, and collaborate with humans.


My research at MIT CSAIL involves developing and evaluating algorithms that enable robots to become capable teammates, empowering human co-workers to be safer, more proficient, and more efficient at their jobs.


Back in March I also created [@DeepDrumpf](http://twitter.com/deepdrumpf), a Twitter account that sounds like Donald Trump using an algorithm I trained with dozens of hours of speech transcripts. (The handle has since picked up nearly 28,000 followers)


Some Tweet highlights:

* https://twitter.com/DeepDrumpf/status/705480367239659520
* https://twitter.com/DeepDrumpf/status/705480113018707969

I’m excited to report that this past month DeepDrumpf [formally announced its “candidacy” for presidency](http://www.deepdrumpf2016.com/) , with [a crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/deepdrumpf) whose funds go directly to the awesome charity [""Girls Who Code""](https://girlswhocode.com/).
 
DeepDrumpf’s algorithm is based around what’s called “deep learning,” which describes a family of techniques within artificial intelligence and machine learning that allows computers to to learn patterns from data on their own. 


It creates Tweets one letter at a time, based on what letters are most likely to follow each other. For example, if it randomly began its Tweet with the letter “D,” it is somewhat likely to be followed by an “R,” and then a “A,” and so on until the bot types out Trump’s latest catchphrase, “Drain the Swamp.” It then starts over for the next sentence and repeats that process until it reaches 140 characters.


The basis of my approach is similar to [existing work](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) that [can simulate Shakespeare](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/shakespear.txt).


My inspiration for it was a report that analyzed the presidential candidates’ linguistic patterns [to find that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/10/21/analysis-donald-trump-talks-to-voters-at-a-fourth-grade-level/).

"PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, we create computational models for artificial intelligence. Ask us anything!Hi reddit!

 We study the evolution of intelligence by conducting experiments in computational simulations of evolution. Our work not only sheds light on the evolution of intelligence in natural animals, but will also accelerate attempts to create artificial intelligence (AI). Individually, we are:


·         Kai Olav Ellefsen, who recently received a Ph.D. from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Robotics 


·         Jean-Baptiste Mouret, who is an associate scientist at Inria (France), and previously was an assistant professor at Pierre & Marie Curie University (France), and


·         Jeff Clune, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming, who directs the [Evolving Artificial Intelligence laboratory] (http://EvolvingAI.org)


Our [recent PLOS Computational Biology paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004128) suggests that when computational brain models called neural networks are organized into modules they are better at learning new information without forgetting old knowledge. The brains of animals (including humans) are modular, which means they have many separate units, such as those for language and facial recognition. While natural animals tend to forget gradually, artificial neural networks currently exhibit what is called 'catastrophic forgetting’, meaning they rapidly overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new skill. We found that modularity significantly reduced such catastrophic forgetting in these computer brains.

At the time, we, the mods of /r/science, noted this:


""This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking. The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions. Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.

It’s now October, and many of you have been asking about the answers. We have them!

This AMA has been a bit of an experiment, and the response from reddit was tremendous. Professor Hawking was overwhelmed by the interest, but has answered as many as he could with the important work he has been up to.

If you’ve been paying attention, you will have seen what else Prof. Hawking has been working on for the last few months:
In July, [Musk, Wozniak and Hawking urge ban on warfare AI and autonomous weapons](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/27/musk-wozniak-hawking-ban-ai-autonomous-weapons)

 “he told an audience at a **public lecture** in Stockholm, Sweden, yesterday. He was speaking in advance of a **scientific talk** today at the Hawking Radiation Conference being held at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.”

Professor Hawking found the time to answer what he could, and we have those answers. With AMAs this popular there are never enough answers to go around, and in this particular case I expect users to understand the reasons.   

For simplicity and organizational purposes each questions and answer will be posted as top level comments to this post.  Follow up questions and comment may be posted in response to each of these comments.  (Other top level comments will be removed.)"

"Science AMA Series: We are Stanford neuroengineers who created a neural prosthesis for monkeys to type Shakespeare with their ""minds"". AUA!We are [Paul Nuyujukian MD PhD](http://npl.stanford.edu/~paul) (Postdoc, soon to be Bioengineering faculty at Stanford) and [Jonathan Kao PhD](http://npl.stanford.edu/~jcykao) (Postdoc, soon to be Electrical Engineering faculty at UCLA), neuroengineers in the [Stanford Neural Prosthetics Systems Laboratory](http://npl.stanford.edu), which is directed by [Professor Krishna Shenoy PhD](http://www.stanford.edu/~shenoy).


We just published a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2016.2586967) in the Proceedings of IEEE in which we demonstrated a high-performance neural prosthesis where monkeys transmitted text one character at a time at a rate of up to 12 words per minute.


[Video of monkey typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxD2KDq18_E)


Before we get ahead of ourselves, let us assure you that monkeys don't understand English. In the video above, the monkeys only saw the green and yellow dots, and not the black letters (which were added afterwards in post-production as a visual aid). The game engine prompted the green targets in a specific sequence that if the monkeys got correct, would spell out words and sentences that we can all understand. The video above was a selection from Hamlet, but the primary data of the paper were articles from the New York Times that the monkeys were asked to ""transcribe."" All they are doing though is navigating the white cursor to the green target at every trial, and earning a liquid reward for each success.


The ability of the monkeys to control the cursor with their brain was accomplished via a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs are systems that record from the brain and translate these measurements to useful control signals, which could be used to control a robotic limb, wheelchair, or, as was in this case, a computer cursor. In this case, the BMI has similar functionality as a one-button computer mouse: it can move in two dimensions and click.


The hardware interfaces used in the BMI, neural electrodes (the one we used was the Utah mulitelectrode array), are not new. They have been around for decades. What is new are the algorithms that translate (or, as we refer to them, ""decode"") the brain signals into movement of the cursor. The machine learning decoding algorithms used in this study were ones that we developed recently ([cursor movement](http://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3265) and [click](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2582691) decoders) that significantly improve the performance of communication BMIs, enabling our monkeys to achieve rates that are 2-3 times faster than rates achievable with prior algorithms.


There is tons more we could write about (algorithm details, clinical trials that these findings have resulted in, what other medical conditions BMIs may help with, etc), but we'll stop here and open it up to you all for questions. We look forward to answering as many of your questions as possible!

"Science AMA Series: I am Sumeet Vadera, a neurosurgeon who specializes in epilepsy surgery at University of California, Irvine, Ask Me Anything!Hi Reddit.

My name is Sumeet Vadera and I am Director of Epilepsy Surgery at University of California, Irvine. I did my Neurosurgery and Epilepsy Surgery training at the Cleveland Clinic. Here is a link to my profile page http://www.ucirvinehealth.org/find-a-doctor/v/sumeet-vadera/.

Here are some aspects of my career that might be interesting to the Reddit community -

1) As an epilepsy surgeon, we have a variety of surgeries that we perform that can be broken down into diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Diagnostic procedures require implanting electrodes within the brain to localize where the seizures are coming from. I have written several papers that have to do with this technique http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=vadera+s. I also have a neurosurgical robot at UCI that helps me perform these surgeries and they recently wrote about the robot and our surgeries in the OC Register http://www.ocregister.com/articles/brain-650683-device-surgery.html
Therapeutic procedures are performed after we know where the seizures are coming from and these include resections (temporal lobectomy, hemispherectomy, etc) and implantation of neurostimulators.

2) I wrote a paper that was published last month in Journal of Surgical Education looking at ""National Incidence of Medication Error in Surgical Patients Before and After Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Duty-Hour Reform.” This is something that has never been looked at before and has some really interesting results. We showed that since the 80 hour Duty Restriction for resident training, there has been a spike in medication errors within teaching hospitals. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26089160

3) We use high tech tools to treat patients with epilepsy. I have robots, lasers and neurostimulator devices that assist me in treating patients who have epilepsy that fails medications.

I'll be back at 3 pm EST (12 pm PST, 9 pm UTC) to answer Ask me anything about about epilepsy surgery, neurosurgery in general, or residency training.

EDIT1: Finished my case early today, I'm here to answer questions now.
EDIT2: Dr Jack Lin, Director of Epilepsy Neurology at UCI has joined me to answer questions related to the neurology side of epilepsy surgery.
EDIT3: Thank you for all the great questions, I hope this was helpful for everyone. I will check tonight if there are any more questions so keep them coming. Feel free to email me at sumeetvadera1@gmail.com. We also are doing some exciting research at UCI and we are always looking for good people to get involved. Feel free to contact me about that as well."
"Science AMA Series: We are Fred Whoriskey and Sara Iverson, directors of the Ocean Tracking Network. We use electronic tags to track migrations and survival of culturally and commercially valued, and endangered aquatic species---from salmonids in North America to sharks in Australia. AMA.Edit: 5:30 EST - Thanks for all your wonderful questions. We had a lot of fun answering them, so much so in fact that we'll be back tomorrow to try to answer anymore. 

We are the directors of the Ocean Tracking Network ([OTN​](http://oceantrackingnetwork.org)), an ocean research, technology development, and data platform.
Fred and I oversee a Network of over 400 international researchers plus their many students working on globally and regionally important issues in our oceans and inland waters.
OTN tracks over 80 species of aquatic animals globally (including tuna, seals, crab, coral reef fishes, manta, and sharks) using mainly acoustic and satellite telemetry.
The research aims to understand things like shifting species into the Arctic with climate change, recovery of commercial stocks (e.g. Atlantic cod), dynamics of shark attacks in Australia, predator-prey interactions, and more generally, the migrations of species from eels to whales.
We also operate a fleet of ocean-going robots (gliders) to track and contextualize animal movements, one of which recently performed the first remote offload of offshore tracking stations while our techs stayed safe and warm, piloting from our HQ in Halifax.

How to make ethical robots
Can Robots Make Ethical Decisions?
"Science AMA Series: I'm Joanna Bryson, a Professor in Artificial (and Natural) Intelligence. I am being consulted by several governments on AI ethics, particularly on the obligations of AI developers towards AI and society. I'd love to talk – AMA!Hi Reddit!


I really do build intelligent systems. I worked as a programmer in the 1980s but got three graduate degrees (in AI & Psychology from Edinburgh and MIT) in the 1990s.  I myself mostly use AI to build models for understanding human behavior, but my students use it for building robots and game AI and I've done that myself in the past.  But while I was doing my PhD I noticed people were way too eager to say that a robot -- just because it was shaped like a human -- must be owed human obligations. This is basically nuts; people think it's about the intelligence, but smart phones are smarter than the vast majority of robots and no one thinks they are people. I am now consulting for IEEE, the European Parliament and the OECD about AI and human society, particularly the economy.  I'm happy to talk to you about anything to do with the science, (systems) engineering (not the math :-), and especially the ethics of AI.  I'm a professor, I like to teach.  But even more importantly I need to learn from you want your concerns are and which of my arguments make any sense to you.  And of course I love learning anything I don't already know about AI and society!  So let's talk...

"Science Discussion: Technology gives us ways to change ourselves that offer great rewards but also huge risks. We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists who work on human augmentation. Let’s discuss![Hi Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! From tattoos and jewelry for expressing ourselves to clothing and fire to help us survive extreme climates, changing our bodies is something humans have always done. But recent technological and scientific advances have allowed us to take human augmentation to new levels. Gene editing, artificial limbs, medical advances, and artificial intelligence systems have all drastically changed the ways we think about what it means to be human. These technologies offer chances to open doors for people with disabilities and explore new frontiers. They advance possibilities for solving big problems like world hunger and health. But they also present new risks and serious ethical challenges.

"Science AMA Series: We study how intelligent machines can help us (think of a car that could park itself after dropping you off) while at the same time they threaten to radically disrupt our economic lives (truckers, bus drivers, and even airline pilots who may be out of a job). Ask us anything!Hi Reddit!

We are computer scientists and ethicists who are examining the societal, ethical, and labor market implications of increasing automation due to artificial intelligence. 
	

Autonomous robots, self-driving cars, drones, and facial recognition devices already are affecting people’s careers, ambitions, privacy, and experiences. With machines becoming more intelligent, many people question whether the world is ethically prepared for the change.  Extreme risks such as killer robots are a concern, but even more so are the issues around fitting autonomous systems into our society.


We’re seeing an impact from artificial intelligence on the labor market.  You hear about the Google Car—there are millions of people who make a living from driving like bus drivers and taxi drivers. What kind of jobs are going to replace them?

"Science AMA Series: Zika! Malaria! Chikungunya! What do we need to know about these mosquito-borne diseases and what can be done about them? Ask us anything!Hi Reddit!

We are writers for Science News (https://www.sciencenews.org/), a publication of the Society for Science and the Public (https://www.societyforscience.org/). With the recent spread of Zika, there have been concerns about the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. What can be done? What answers can science provide us? Together, we have written extensively on Zika, gene drives, genetically engineered mosquitoes, and general mosquito biology. Ask us anything!

I'm Meghan Rosen, and I’m the general assignment reporter at Science News. It’s a grab bag beat that I love because I’m always learning about something new (from disaster robots to lead poisoning to a new form of carbon that glows in the dark). This year I’ve been covering the Zika virus outbreak that emerged in Brazil in 2015, and may be to blame for the country’s recent surge in microcephaly cases. I have a Ph.D. in molecular biology and biochemistry (with an emphasis in biotechnology) from UC Davis, and graduated from UC Santa Cruz’s Science Communication program in 2012. (https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rapid-spread-zika-virus-americas-raises-alarm?mode=pick&context=169&tgt=nr)

I’m Tina Saey, the molecular biology writer at Science News. I cover a broad range of topics from viruses to human evolutionary history, with occasional forays into penguin tongues and water bear survival tactics. Basically, if it has DNA I will write about it. But don’t worry, red blood cells and non-DNA-based extraterrestrial life, I’ve got you covered, too. One of the hottest topics on my beat has been the gene-editing tool called CRISPR/Cas9 and its scientific, medical and ethical implications. Pertinent to this discussion is an application of CRISPR called gene drives. Scientists hope to eliminate mosquito-borne diseases and invasive species, but worry about unforeseen consequences (such as causing the extinction of entire species) of the technology.  (https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-spread-their-wings)

I'm Susan Milius, and I write about creatures great and small, and even photosynthetic, for Science News. I’m aghast at the number of years I just slapped mosquitoes without even wondering which of several thousand species, quite diverse in their tastes, I had just smeared on the wall. (Some are blue. Some hate the outdoors as much as any human couch potato. Some don’t even drink blood.) Now those distinctions explain why some major disease-carrying mosquitoes just laugh at our attempts to control them. It took me a bit of exploring other kinds of journalism to realize that after double-majoring in biology and English, I could get a job writing in English about biology.  It’s a wonderful life, even with mosquitoes in it.

I used to work as a professional programmer myself in the 1980s and 1990s, including for LEGO! But since getting three graduate degrees (in AI & Psychology from Edinburgh and MIT, the last in 2001) I've been a full time academic.  Last year I did an AMA on AI and AI ethics that you guys really liked, so my University suggested we do it again, this time talking about the work I've been doing since 2010 in AI policy -- helping governments, non-government organisations like the Red Cross or the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), tech companies and society at large figure out how we can fit AI into our society, including our homes, work, democracy, war, and economy. So we can talk some more about AI again, but also this time let's talk mostly about regulation and law, how we treat AI and the companies and people who make it, why humans need to keep being the responsible agents, and anything else you want to discuss.

"I’m Rana el Kaliouby, Host of NOVA Wonders & CEO of Affectiva. Ask me anything!With AI becoming mainstream, how will it affect the way we interact with our devices and how we communicate with each other?



My name is Rana el Kaliouby, and I’m an Egyptian-American scientist and entrepreneur on a mission to humanize technology. I care deeply about ethics and trust in AI, from considering algorithmic bias to ensuring consent and data privacy. As Co-founder and CEO of Affectiva, an MIT spin-off that builds artificial emotional intelligence (“Emotion AI”), my company uses cutting-edge software that analyzes complex and nuanced emotional and cognitive states from the human face and voice, ultimately engineering empathy. For me, teaching machines to measure and interpret human emotions has the potential to enhance consumer experiences, engage students and personalize their learning, allow doctors and nurses to deliver better care, increase road safety by tracking driver alertness, and enable people with autism to better communicate with their families and peers.



I consider myself a role-model for young scientists who are considering careers in technology and entrepreneurship. As a female Muslim scientist who’s one of a handful of women CEOs in the tech industry, I’m a huge advocate for diversity and inclusion–– not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the only way we can design and build smart technologies for an increasingly global world.



Today, I’m also a co-host on PBS NOVA’s new series “NOVA Wonders,” in which incredible scientists from all walks of life tackle some of the biggest questions about life and the cosmos. I believe that science is the vehicle for innovation, so I’m truly excited to be a part of “NOVA Wonders”–– I especially love how NOVA shows that scientists come in all shapes, colors and sizes, thus providing diverse role-models that aspiring scientists can relate to and be encouraged by.



I’m a World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leader and I served on WEF’s Global Future Council on AI and Robotics. I’m also a member of the Partnership on AI, which is concerned with ensuring that AI benefits society and is applied for good. A former research scientist at the MIT Media Lab with a PhD in computer vision and machine learning from the University of Cambridge, I use my voice to advocate for women in tech and for beneficial uses of AI–– I’m often cited in and interviewed by top business and mainstream outlets, including The New Yorker, Wired, Forbes, Fast Company, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and TIME Magazine. Check out [my TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/rana_el_kaliouby_this_app_knows_how_you_feel_from_the_look_on_your_face) and [my Inc. column](https://www.inc.com/rana-el-kaliouby/the-debate-on-artificial-intelligence-needs-to-get-smarter-here-are-5-things-everyone-should-know.html), and do make sure to watch PBS NOVA’s episode on [Can we Build a Brain](http://www.pbs.org/video/49a31108-181b-453c-86b8-fcb39f745922/), which premieres May 16 on PBS!

"Science AMA Series: I’m the MIT computer scientist who created a Twitterbot that uses AI to sound like Donald Trump. During the day, I work on human-robot collaboration. AMA!Hi reddit! My name is [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info) and I’m a postdoctoral associate at MIT’s [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) interested in building autonomous robots that can learn from, communicate with, and collaborate with humans.


My research at MIT CSAIL involves developing and evaluating algorithms that enable robots to become capable teammates, empowering human co-workers to be safer, more proficient, and more efficient at their jobs.


Back in March I also created [@DeepDrumpf](http://twitter.com/deepdrumpf), a Twitter account that sounds like Donald Trump using an algorithm I trained with dozens of hours of speech transcripts. (The handle has since picked up nearly 28,000 followers)


Some Tweet highlights:

* https://twitter.com/DeepDrumpf/status/705465462721744896


I’m excited to report that this past month DeepDrumpf [formally announced its “candidacy” for presidency](http://www.deepdrumpf2016.com/) , with [a crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/deepdrumpf) whose funds go directly to the awesome charity [""Girls Who Code""](https://girlswhocode.com/).
 
DeepDrumpf’s algorithm is based around what’s called “deep learning,” which describes a family of techniques within artificial intelligence and machine learning that allows computers to to learn patterns from data on their own. 


It creates Tweets one letter at a time, based on what letters are most likely to follow each other. For example, if it randomly began its Tweet with the letter “D,” it is somewhat likely to be followed by an “R,” and then a “A,” and so on until the bot types out Trump’s latest catchphrase, “Drain the Swamp.” It then starts over for the next sentence and repeats that process until it reaches 140 characters.


The basis of my approach is similar to [existing work](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) that [can simulate Shakespeare](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/shakespear.txt).


My inspiration for it was a report that analyzed the presidential candidates’ linguistic patterns [to find that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/10/21/analysis-donald-trump-talks-to-voters-at-a-fourth-grade-level/).

(http://www.davedesteno.com/the-truth-about-trust)

For the past two decades, I’ve been fascinated by how, when, and why emotions shape our decisions, especially those that have to do with vice and virtue. Whether we’re examining hypocrisy and compassion, pride and punishment, cheating and trust, my research group’s work continually shows that human moral behavior is much more variable than most would predict.

One of my primary goals is to figure out how to leverage emotion-based mechanisms of the mind to help individuals make better decisions and, hopefully along the way, to nudge the greater good. Along those lines, here’s info about some of my most recent work. I’d be happy to hear your thoughts and questions about these, or anything else (including the process of scientific review, in my role as editor, given the many stories about scientific fraud and failures of data to replicate we’ve seen in the news lately).

• Whether we call it self-control, grit, or the like, the ability to delay gratification is central to success, as you may have learned via the famous Marshmallow Test. But how do you gain self-control? For centuries, the supposed answer was easy: use willpower to control your desires by squelching your emotions. In my brand new cover story for [Pacific Standard magazine, published today, I’ll show you why that view is incorrect.](http://www.psmag.com/?p=89456)

• Can you tell if a stranger is trustworthy? To date, most methods have failed (the TSA’s recent $40 million program was shown to be virtually useless). These repeated failures don’t occur because it’s impossible, but rather because we’ve been going about it in the wrong way. Here’s a video of our most recent work showing how to detect trustworthiness [using humanoid robots to boot!](http://hbr.org/video/3166586123001/trustworthy-signals)

• Many spiritual leaders like the Dalai Lama talk about how compassion can increase well-being, and how compassion can spread virally and reduce suffering. But do these claims have any scientific basis? We think they do. You can check out a video of me talking about why, or read pieces I’ve written on compassion and mindfulness for the [New York Times 1,]

"Science AMA Series: I am Lilian Hsiao, a chemical engineer at MIT who studies the mechanics of non-Newtonian fluids and soft matter - with special interest in shear thickening fluids - aka the ""pot of thing"" that Hydraulic Press crushed recently. AMA!Hello Reddit! My name is Lilian Hsiao, and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT. I will be starting as an assistant professor at NC State this Fall. [Why is crushing a non-Newtonian fluid with hydraulic press so weird?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAZQ-wE6rdc) Many materials we use in everyday life, like shampoo and coffee, are actually non-Newtonian. Our blood, mucus, and joint fluids are all non-Newtonian too! My research involves finding the microscopic reasons as to why complex fluids behave in such odd ways, and engineering new types of soft bio-mimetic materials with colloid-sized particles (~1/100th of a human hair) that give them interesting microstructure.


Why is this important? For one, microscopic structures have a big impact on what we can measure or feel on the bulk scale. Also, I can self-assemble materials that respond to temperature changes - imagine a porous particle that shrinks and releases drug on-demand at 37C, or artificial muscles made out of filaments that are assembled block by block. I use a lot of high-speed microscopy to capture these events at the microscopic level, then connect them to properties like viscosity and mechanical strength.

"Science AMS Series: We're Andrew Merrie and Simon Stålenhag for the Radical Ocean Futures #ArtScience project, ask us anything!Hey lovely /r/science community! thank you so much for your presence, enthusiasm and questions. Simon, Patrick and myself really enjoyed the opportunity to engage. We will keep an eye on the thread over the coming days and make sure to keep engaging and responding. thanks to all of you and please don't forget to explore radicaloceanfutures.earth!

The latest ocean science shows that we are actually heading towards a fairly dystopian ocean future. In the last few years, the west Antarctic ice sheet has cracked, the Arctic is melting at un unprecedented pace, the oceans have lost more than 2% of their oxygen in the last 50 years and 7% by 2100. Micro plastics have become a major area of concern and are moving through marine food chains…. persistent organic pollutants are being found in deep sea organisms at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. BUT! All hope is not yet lost. The [UN Oceans conference](https://oceanconference.un.org/), kicking off June 5, is a chance to start our move away from the ‘Rime of the last Fisherman’ and towards something else, a different future narrative where the oceans are not just: 'oily, hot, acidic, and full of dead fish'.

The Radical Ocean Futures #ArtScience project is founded on the belief that sometimes science fiction might succeed where scientific papers fall short. It blends art, science and music and merges scientific fact with creative speculation. The heart of the project is four short 'Radical Ocean Futures.' These are scientifically grounded narratives of potential future oceans. Each narrative is supported by both a visual and a musical interpretation to allow multiple entry points and stimulate the imagination. The purpose of this project is to explore tools that can help us to think creatively and imaginatively about our future oceans and assess how unexpected changes, along with human responses to those changes, may play out in a complex world that is, at its heart, surprising.

"Here's what's actually in the NASA 2011 Budgethttp://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf

Initially, I was fairly upset at about the cancellation of the Constellation program, and the news media along with some politicians made it seem like it would be the beginning of the end for the United States space program.

Shock and surprise, however, the 2011 NASA budget has been grossly misrepresented in the media.

The above link is to a PDF outlining the plan for NASA funding over the course of the next several years (monetary values in all charts are in millions of dollars).

Here's what's getting funding:

* Extensive research into new technologies making space-flight more efficient and cost effective
* Robotic precursor missions to the Moon, Mars, Lagrange points, etc. to gauge what will be necessary for manned exploration of Mars and asteroids.
* Research into new heavy-lift and propulsion technologies
* Opening up LEO to private industry
* Working with and encouraging private industry to develop new technologies that will advance space flight
* Retirement of the shuttle program and revamping the Kennedy Space Center (!)
* Extension of the ISS and attempting to utilize it to its full potential
* More extensive climate change research
* Research into ""green"" aviation

So NASA isn't giving up on space exploration, and it isn't just handing things over to private industry (it's merely going to incorporate it more). In fact, space exploration efforts will see an increase in funding by several billion dollars over the course of the next five years. Meanwhile, private industry will help advance efforts in LEO so that NASA can focus on the things that are most important (and the long term goals that corporations probably won't touch yet).

The Constellation program is canceled but it has been replaced by a program that is likely far more cost-effective and realistic.

From the PDF: ""Most important, we are not ending our ambitions to explore space. In order to explore new frontiers, we are launching a vigorous new technology development and test program that will
pursue game-changing technology development that can take us further and faster and more affordably into space.""

My research at MIT CSAIL involves developing and evaluating algorithms that enable robots to become capable teammates, empowering human co-workers to be safer, more proficient, and more efficient at their jobs.


Back in March I also created [@DeepDrumpf](http://twitter.com/deepdrumpf), a Twitter account that sounds like Donald Trump using an algorithm I trained with dozens of hours of speech transcripts. (The handle has since picked up nearly 28,000 followers)

DeepDrumpf’s algorithm is based around what’s called “deep learning,” which describes a family of techniques within artificial intelligence and machine learning that allows computers to to learn patterns from data on their own. 


It creates Tweets one letter at a time, based on what letters are most likely to follow each other. For example, if it randomly began its Tweet with the letter “D,” it is somewhat likely to be followed by an “R,” and then a “A,” and so on until the bot types out Trump’s latest catchphrase, “Drain the Swamp.” It then starts over for the next sentence and repeats that process until it reaches 140 characters.


The basis of my approach is similar to [existing work](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) that [can simulate Shakespeare](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/shakespear.txt).

A bit about Kepler and K2… 

Launched in March 2009, Kepler is NASA's first mission to detect small Earth-size planets in the just right 'Goldilocks Zone' of other stars. So far, Kepler has detected more than 4,200 exoplanet candidates and verified nearly 1,000 as bonafide planets. Through Kepler discoveries, planets are now known to be common and diverse, showing the universe hosts a vast range of environments.

After the failure of two of its four reaction wheels following the completion of data collection in its primary Kepler mission, the spacecraft was resuscitated this year and reborn as K2.  The K2 mission extends the Kepler legacy to exoplanet and astrophysical observations in the ecliptic– the part of the sky that is home to the familiar constellations of the zodiac.

The Kepler and K2 missions are based at [NASA's Ames Research Center](http://www.nasa.gov/ames) in the heart of Silicon Valley.

Kim Lee Sim. 

Our team is working towards the goal of producing the first malaria vaccine capable of eliminating malaria. To produce our vaccine, we grow the parasites in mosquitoes, irradiate the mosquitoes, and hand-dissect the mosquito salivary glands. The salivary glands contain malaria parasites called sporozoites, which comprise our vaccine.  After purifying and vialing the sporozoites, the vaccine is ready to go. 
 
Last year, [during a clinical trial of our PfSPZ Vaccine](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1359.abstract), we demonstrated our malaria vaccine protected all subjects of one group against malaria, a first for any malaria vaccine candidate.  If you do not have access to Science, you can read about our paper in the [Scientific American article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zapped-malaria-parasite-raises-vaccine-hopes/).  We are running a multitude of clinical trials in an effort to further refining the dosing regimen and move our product towards licensure. 
 
We currently successfully and rapidly dissect each mosquito by hand, but this a tedious, time consuming, and laborious process. In order to be able to optimally scale-up the manufacturing process,  we recently partnered with the Harvard BioRobotics Lab to develop a mosquito-dissecting robot named SporoBot.  You can find more about our crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for SporoBot [here](http://www.sporobot.com/).

We are computer scientists and ethicists who are examining the societal, ethical, and labor market implications of increasing automation due to artificial intelligence. 
	

Autonomous robots, self-driving cars, drones, and facial recognition devices already are affecting people’s careers, ambitions, privacy, and experiences. With machines becoming more intelligent, many people question whether the world is ethically prepared for the change.  Extreme risks such as killer robots are a concern, but even more so are the issues around fitting autonomous systems into our society.


We’re seeing an impact from artificial intelligence on the labor market.  You hear about the Google Car—there are millions of people who make a living from driving like bus drivers and taxi drivers. What kind of jobs are going to replace them?

"Science AMA Series: We are SynTouch, engineers who make tactile sensors that rival the human fingertip and use them to make next-generation prosthetics and robotics. AMA!We are SynTouch: we've invented the only sensor in the world that endows robots with the ability to replicate the human sense of touch. We use these sensors to make robots and prosthetics that do everything your own fingers do: they enable dexterity, prevent damage, provide awareness, protect humans, and improve product quality.

SynTouch was founded in 2008 by Professor Gerald Loeb, and PhD students Matthew Borzage, Jeremy Fishel, and Nicholas Wettels who were at the University of Southern California. We successfully raised research funds through SBIR grants from the NIH, NSF, DARPA, USDA, and NIST.

SynTouch started with the goal of endowing robotic hands with the ability to perform human-like capabilities: the identification, and manipulation of objects to perform useful tasks. The existence proof that such capabilities are possible is the human hand. We practice biomimetic design and have learned from the human hand what tactile information is useful. This required understanding the sensing capabilities of a human finger: detecting deformations, vibrations, and thermal gradients. It also required an appreciation of the mechanical features of a human fingertip: the shape of the bone, compliance of the skin, presence of fingerprints. These seemingly unimportant features of a human fingertip are all critical for the identification and manipulation of objects. Combining these in a package that is robust and field serviceable led us to develop the BioTac®.

Jumping forward to 2014 we're at the forefront of Machine Touch®; we build our BioTac sensors, and program robots with the intelligence to move them and process the resulting data. We've used BioTacs to enhance prosthetics by creating tactile reflexes, integrated them with a dozen types of dexterous robotic hands, helped international companies determine how their products feel, and sold our sensors to researchers in labs around the world.

We look forward to answering your questions about robots, prosthetics, engineering startups, and the sense of touch. AMA!

"Science AMA Series: I’m Jessy Grizzle, the inaugural Director of Robotics at the University of Michigan. My group produces some of the world’s most advanced algorithms that allow bipedal robots to walk over uneven terrain. AMA!Hi reddit!

My group, the Dynamic Legged Locomotion Laboratory, is best known for two walking robots: MABEL and MARLO. Two of my outstanding graduate students, Xingye “Dennis” Da and Ross Hartley, will be helping me out with questions about MARLO today. Here’s our lab’s YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/DynamicLegLocomotion 

MARLO, our current robot, is capable of walking without support in any direction (3D walking). We take it over some of the most challenging terrain we can find. It falls, it breaks; we order new parts, improve our algorithms, and go out again. We’ve managed to walk down steep hills, through woodland, and most recently, we’ve seen early success on the Wave Field - a field covered with grassy mounds that are about three feet high. Here’s a playlist of MARLO experiments: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFe0SMV3hBCDPEEhG0iLEvXVpfQsq_NdS 

MABEL, MARLO’s predecessor, was capable of 2D walking (in circles, attached to a boom). It could recover from trips and walk up and down obstacles in its way. MABEL is most famous for running at a pace equivalent to a 9-minute mile. We took what we learned in 2D walking with MABEL and applied it to MARLO. Here’s a playlist of MABEL experiments. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFe0SMV3hBCDseftwp7X0Wmi2halvfr3H 

MABEL and MARLO are underactuated robots - they don’t have control over every joint. For instance, MARLO’s feet swing freely from its ankles. This makes our algorithms applicable to more robots, including those that have actuated ankles.

They can also provide a basis for robotic prosthetics. One of our collaborators, Bobby Gregg at the University of Texas, Dallas, develops prosthetic legs for humans. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl1IXs0j4Ww 

But robotics is much more than walking robots. My colleagues at Michigan work on projects such as drones that communicate to avoid collisions, autonomous underwater robots, robots that help people recover from injuries and surgeries, the next generation of robots in factories and, of course, driverless cars. If there is enough interest in the Reddit community, we may be able to recruit some of these experts for future AMAs! More about the Robotics Institute here: http://robotics.umich.edu/

"Science AMA Series: I’m Manolis Kellis, a professor of computer science at MIT studying the human genome to learn about what causes obesity, Alzheimer’s, cancer and other conditions. AMA about comp-bio and epigenomics, and how they impact human health!Hello Reddit! 

Hello Reddit! My name’s Manolis Kellis, and I’m a professor at MIT’s [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) (CSAIL), where I lead the [Computational Biology](http://compbio.mit.edu/) group, and am also a member of the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](http://broadinstitute.org/).

I study [the human genome](https://www.genome.gov/18016863/a-brief-guide-to-genomics/) and its supremely underrated cousin, [the human epigenome](https://www.genome.gov/27532724/epigenomics-fact-sheet/).

Basically, your genome is the DNA you’re born with (“the book of life”). Your genes are the same in all your cells, but they play very different functions thanks to your epigenome, which highlights the parts of the genome that are important in each of your cell types. 

Last year, a decade after the human genome was sequenced, I was part of the team that helped create the most comprehensive map of the epigenome, as part of the [Roadmap Epigenomics](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/) and [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/) consortium. 

By studying these maps, our team has helped figure out [the control switches](http://news.mit.edu/2015/human-epigenome-map-0218) that turn your genes on and off in different cell types. The locations and activity of those switches have helped us gain insights about many diseases, including [Alzheimer’s](http://news.mit.edu/2015/epigenomics-alzheimers-disease-0218), [cardiovascular disease](http://news.mit.edu/2016/gene-variants-targets-heart-arrhythmia-0510), and [obesity](http://news.mit.edu/2015/pathway-controls-metabolism-underlying-obesity-0819).

Our results are sometimes challenging the way we see common disorders. For example, we found that genetic variants contributing to Alzheimer’s act through immune processes, rather than neuronal processes. For obesity, we found that the strongest genetic association acts via a master switch controlling energy storage vs. energy dissipation in our fat cells, rather than through the control of appetite in the brain. 

We hope that these insights will pave the way for [new therapeutics](http://www.plengegen.com/blog/arid5b-fto-irx3irx5-regulatory-axis-drug-discovery-obesity-nejm/). For example, we showed that we can manipulate the obesity switch we uncovered in human cells and in mice, to switch human fat-storing cells into fat-burning cells, and to boost the metabolism of mice, causing them to lose 50% of their fat mass with no change in exercise or appetite. 

In addition to disease genomics, my group works on [comparative genomics](http://news.mit.edu/2011/genomic-dark-matter-1013), [microRNAs](http://news.mit.edu/2008/micro-rna-0109), [biological](http://news.mit.edu/2012/the-wisdom-of-crowds-nature-methods-paper) [networks](https://www.broadinstitute.org/blog/algorithm-seeks-meaningful-relationships), [flies](http://news.mit.edu/2007/fruitfly-1109), [non-coding RNAs](http://news.mit.edu/2013/unusual-suspects-1215), and [genome evolution](http://news.mit.edu/2004/yeast-0310). You can explore our papers from these and other areas in [our interactive research page](http://compbio.mit.edu/explore.html), and check out some [related news stories](https://storify.com/manoliskellis/news), or watch [video lectures](https://storify.com/manoliskellis/videos) describing our work, including my TEDx talk on the [genomic revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlVZ0ORtpPM).

I also teach two courses on computational biology that you may find interesting. [Computational Biology: Genomes, Networks, Evolution](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa15/6.047) provides a broad introduction to the field. [Computational Personal Genomics](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp16/6.881/) surveys recent papers in human genetics and genomics. You can find both of these courses online, and I encourage you to explore many related classes through [MIT’s Open CourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). 

A bit about me: I was born and raised in Greece, moved to France and then New York as a teenager, and got my Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Ph.D. degrees from MIT. I did my [Ph.D. thesis](http://web.mit.edu/manoli/www/thesis.html) with [Eric Lander](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/eric-s-lander) and [Bonnie Berger](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) at MIT on computational genomics.

"Science AMA Series: We’re NASA scientists. Ask us anything about the Aug. 21 total solar eclipse!**Edit, 4:31 PM ET** We're signing off. Thanks for all of your questions! Some of us will try to answer more questions throughout the next couple of days. And remember, all our eclipse info is at [eclipse2017.nasa.gov](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/) 

**Edit, 3:03 PM ET** We're live! 

**We'll be online answering questions starting at 3 PM ET!**

On Monday, August 21, 2017, daylight will fade to the level of a moonlit night as millions of Americans experience a total solar eclipse. For the first time in nearly 100 years (since 1918), the moon’s shadow will sweep coast-to-coast across the US, putting 14 states in the path of totality, and providing a view of a partial eclipse across all 50 states.


A solar eclipse happens when a rare alignment of the sun and moon casts a shadow on Earth. Eclipses provide an unparalleled opportunity for us to see the sun’s faint outer atmosphere, the corona, in a way that can’t be replicated by human-made instruments. We believe this region of the sun is the main driver for the sun’s constant outpouring of radiation, known as the solar wind, as well as powerful bursts of solar material that can be harmful to satellites, orbiting astronauts and power grids on the ground.


We’re here to talk about

   •         What you’ll see on August 21st & how to watch it safely

   •         Why we’re excited to study the sun during this eclipse & [our upcoming mission to the sun](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe)

"Science AMS Series: We're Andrew Merrie and Simon Stålenhag for the Radical Ocean Futures #ArtScience project, ask us anything!Hey lovely /r/science community! thank you so much for your presence, enthusiasm and questions. Simon, Patrick and myself really enjoyed the opportunity to engage. We will keep an eye on the thread over the coming days and make sure to keep engaging and responding. thanks to all of you and please don't forget to explore radicaloceanfutures.earth!

The latest ocean science shows that we are actually heading towards a fairly dystopian ocean future. In the last few years, the west Antarctic ice sheet has cracked, the Arctic is melting at un unprecedented pace, the oceans have lost more than 2% of their oxygen in the last 50 years and 7% by 2100. Micro plastics have become a major area of concern and are moving through marine food chains…. persistent organic pollutants are being found in deep sea organisms at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. BUT! All hope is not yet lost. The [UN Oceans conference](https://oceanconference.un.org/), kicking off June 5, is a chance to start our move away from the ‘Rime of the last Fisherman’ and towards something else, a different future narrative where the oceans are not just: 'oily, hot, acidic, and full of dead fish'.

The Radical Ocean Futures #ArtScience project is founded on the belief that sometimes science fiction might succeed where scientific papers fall short. It blends art, science and music and merges scientific fact with creative speculation. The heart of the project is four short 'Radical Ocean Futures.' These are scientifically grounded narratives of potential future oceans. Each narrative is supported by both a visual and a musical interpretation to allow multiple entry points and stimulate the imagination. The purpose of this project is to explore tools that can help us to think creatively and imaginatively about our future oceans and assess how unexpected changes, along with human responses to those changes, may play out in a complex world that is, at its heart, surprising.

"Science AMA Series: I'm David DeSteno, professor of psychology at Northeastern University. I study how human emotions shape our decisions and build virtue. Ask me anything!Hi Reddit! I’m David DeSteno, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, editor-in-chief of the American Psychological Association’s journal Emotion, and author of The Truth About Trust [Hudson Street Press, 2014.]
(http://www.davedesteno.com/the-truth-about-trust)

For the past two decades, I’ve been fascinated by how, when, and why emotions shape our decisions, especially those that have to do with vice and virtue. Whether we’re examining hypocrisy and compassion, pride and punishment, cheating and trust, my research group’s work continually shows that human moral behavior is much more variable than most would predict.

One of my primary goals is to figure out how to leverage emotion-based mechanisms of the mind to help individuals make better decisions and, hopefully along the way, to nudge the greater good. Along those lines, here’s info about some of my most recent work. I’d be happy to hear your thoughts and questions about these, or anything else (including the process of scientific review, in my role as editor, given the many stories about scientific fraud and failures of data to replicate we’ve seen in the news lately).

• Whether we call it self-control, grit, or the like, the ability to delay gratification is central to success, as you may have learned via the famous Marshmallow Test. But how do you gain self-control? For centuries, the supposed answer was easy: use willpower to control your desires by squelching your emotions. In my brand new cover story for [Pacific Standard magazine, published today, I’ll show you why that view is incorrect.](http://www.psmag.com/?p=89456)

• Can you tell if a stranger is trustworthy? To date, most methods have failed (the TSA’s recent $40 million program was shown to be virtually useless). These repeated failures don’t occur because it’s impossible, but rather because we’ve been going about it in the wrong way. Here’s a video of our most recent work showing how to detect trustworthiness [using humanoid robots to boot!](http://hbr.org/video/3166586123001/trustworthy-signals)

• Many spiritual leaders like the Dalai Lama talk about how compassion can increase well-being, and how compassion can spread virally and reduce suffering. But do these claims have any scientific basis? We think they do. You can check out a video of me talking about why, or read pieces I’ve written on compassion and mindfulness for the [New York Times 1,]

"I'm Joanna Bryson, a Professor in Artificial (and Natural) Intelligence at the University of Bath. I’d love to talk about AI regulation and law, how we treat AI and the companies and people who make it, why humans need to keep being the responsible agents, and anything else - AMA!I really do build AI, mostly myself to study natural intelligence (especially human cooperation), but with my PhD students I also work on making anthropomorphic AI like in computer game characters or domestic robots transparent (understandable) to its users, because that makes it safer and more ethical. I used to work as a professional programmer myself in the 1980s and 1990s, including for LEGO! But since getting three graduate degrees (in AI & Psychology from Edinburgh and MIT, the last in 2001) I've been a full time academic.  Last year I did an AMA on AI and AI ethics that you guys really liked, so my University suggested we do it again, this time talking about the work I've been doing since 2010 in AI policy -- helping governments, non-government organisations like the Red Cross or the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), tech companies and society at large figure out how we can fit AI into our society, including our homes, work, democracy, war, and economy. So we can talk some more about AI again, but also this time let's talk mostly about regulation and law, how we treat AI and the companies and people who make it, why humans need to keep being the responsible agents, and anything else you want to discuss. Just like last year, I look forwards not only to teaching (which I love) but learning from you, including about your concerns and just whether my arguments make sense to you.

"Here's what's actually in the NASA 2011 Budgethttp://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf

Initially, I was fairly upset at about the cancellation of the Constellation program, and the news media along with some politicians made it seem like it would be the beginning of the end for the United States space program.

Shock and surprise, however, the 2011 NASA budget has been grossly misrepresented in the media.

The above link is to a PDF outlining the plan for NASA funding over the course of the next several years (monetary values in all charts are in millions of dollars).

Here's what's getting funding:

* Extensive research into new technologies making space-flight more efficient and cost effective
* Robotic precursor missions to the Moon, Mars, Lagrange points, etc. to gauge what will be necessary for manned exploration of Mars and asteroids.
* Research into new heavy-lift and propulsion technologies
* Opening up LEO to private industry
* Working with and encouraging private industry to develop new technologies that will advance space flight
* Retirement of the shuttle program and revamping the Kennedy Space Center (!)
* Extension of the ISS and attempting to utilize it to its full potential
* More extensive climate change research
* Research into ""green"" aviation

So NASA isn't giving up on space exploration, and it isn't just handing things over to private industry (it's merely going to incorporate it more). In fact, space exploration efforts will see an increase in funding by several billion dollars over the course of the next five years. Meanwhile, private industry will help advance efforts in LEO so that NASA can focus on the things that are most important (and the long term goals that corporations probably won't touch yet).

The Constellation program is canceled but it has been replaced by a program that is likely far more cost-effective and realistic.

From the PDF: ""Most important, we are not ending our ambitions to explore space. In order to explore new frontiers, we are launching a vigorous new technology development and test program that will
pursue game-changing technology development that can take us further and faster and more affordably into space.""

"Science AMA Series: We are Stanford neuroengineers who created a neural prosthesis for monkeys to type Shakespeare with their ""minds"".

We just published a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2016.2586967) in the Proceedings of IEEE in which we demonstrated a high-performance neural prosthesis where monkeys transmitted text one character at a time at a rate of up to 12 words per minute.


[Video of monkey typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxD2KDq18_E)


Before we get ahead of ourselves, let us assure you that monkeys don't understand English. In the video above, the monkeys only saw the green and yellow dots, and not the black letters (which were added afterwards in post-production as a visual aid). The game engine prompted the green targets in a specific sequence that if the monkeys got correct, would spell out words and sentences that we can all understand. The video above was a selection from Hamlet, but the primary data of the paper were articles from the New York Times that the monkeys were asked to ""transcribe."" All they are doing though is navigating the white cursor to the green target at every trial, and earning a liquid reward for each success.


The ability of the monkeys to control the cursor with their brain was accomplished via a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs are systems that record from the brain and translate these measurements to useful control signals, which could be used to control a robotic limb, wheelchair, or, as was in this case, a computer cursor. In this case, the BMI has similar functionality as a one-button computer mouse: it can move in two dimensions and click.


The hardware interfaces used in the BMI, neural electrodes (the one we used was the Utah mulitelectrode array), are not new. They have been around for decades. What is new are the algorithms that translate (or, as we refer to them, ""decode"") the brain signals into movement of the cursor. The machine learning decoding algorithms used in this study were ones that we developed recently ([cursor movement](http://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3265) and [click](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2582691) decoders) that significantly improve the performance of communication BMIs, enabling our monkeys to achieve rates that are 2-3 times faster than rates achievable with prior algorithms.


There is tons more we could write about (algorithm details, clinical trials that these findings have resulted in, what other medical conditions BMIs may help with, etc), but we'll stop here and open it up to you all for questions. We look forward to answering as many of your questions as possible!

"Science AMA Series: I am Dr. Stephen L. Hoffman, my company developed an effective Malaria Vaccine. We’ve partnered with Harvard to work to provide the vaccine at the lowest cost possible to the World’s poorest and most underserved. AMA!My name is [Stephen L. Hoffman](http://www.sanaria.com/index.php?s=44).  I am the CEO and Chief Scientific Officer at Sanaria Inc. a small biotech company in Rockville, Maryland.  I was the Director of the Malaria Program at the Naval Medical Research Center and later the Senior Vice President of Biologics at Celera Genomics. I then founded Sanaria with my wife, B. Kim Lee Sim. 

Our team is working towards the goal of producing the first malaria vaccine capable of eliminating malaria. To produce our vaccine, we grow the parasites in mosquitoes, irradiate the mosquitoes, and hand-dissect the mosquito salivary glands. The salivary glands contain malaria parasites called sporozoites, which comprise our vaccine.  After purifying and vialing the sporozoites, the vaccine is ready to go. 
 
Last year, [during a clinical trial of our PfSPZ Vaccine](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1359.abstract), we demonstrated our malaria vaccine protected all subjects of one group against malaria, a first for any malaria vaccine candidate.  If you do not have access to Science, you can read about our paper in the [Scientific American article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zapped-malaria-parasite-raises-vaccine-hopes/).  We are running a multitude of clinical trials in an effort to further refining the dosing regimen and move our product towards licensure. 
 
We currently successfully and rapidly dissect each mosquito by hand, but this a tedious, time consuming, and laborious process. In order to be able to optimally scale-up the manufacturing process,  we recently partnered with the Harvard BioRobotics Lab to develop a mosquito-dissecting robot named SporoBot.

"Science AMA Series: I am Sumeet Vadera, a neurosurgeon who specializes in epilepsy surgery at University of California, Irvine, Ask Me Anything!Hi Reddit.

My name is Sumeet Vadera and I am Director of Epilepsy Surgery at University of California, Irvine. I did my Neurosurgery and Epilepsy Surgery training at the Cleveland Clinic. Here is a link to my profile page http://www.ucirvinehealth.org/find-a-doctor/v/sumeet-vadera/.

Here are some aspects of my career that might be interesting to the Reddit community -

1) As an epilepsy surgeon, we have a variety of surgeries that we perform that can be broken down into diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Diagnostic procedures require implanting electrodes within the brain to localize where the seizures are coming from. I have written several papers that have to do with this technique http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=vadera+s. I also have a neurosurgical robot at UCI that helps me perform these surgeries and they recently wrote about the robot and our surgeries in the OC Register http://www.ocregister.com/articles/brain-650683-device-surgery.html
Therapeutic procedures are performed after we know where the seizures are coming from and these include resections (temporal lobectomy, hemispherectomy, etc) and implantation of neurostimulators.

2) I wrote a paper that was published last month in Journal of Surgical Education looking at ""National Incidence of Medication Error in Surgical Patients Before and After Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Duty-Hour Reform.” This is something that has never been looked at before and has some really interesting results. We showed that since the 80 hour Duty Restriction for resident training, there has been a spike in medication errors within teaching hospitals. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26089160

3) We use high tech tools to treat patients with epilepsy. I have robots, lasers and neurostimulator devices that assist me in treating patients who have epilepsy that fails medications.

The video above was a selection from Hamlet, but the primary data of the paper were articles from the New York Times that the monkeys were asked to ""transcribe."" All they are doing though is navigating the white cursor to the green target at every trial, and earning a liquid reward for each success.


The ability of the monkeys to control the cursor with their brain was accomplished via a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs are systems that record from the brain and translate these measurements to useful control signals, which could be used to control a robotic limb, wheelchair, or, as was in this case, a computer cursor. In this case, the BMI has similar functionality as a one-button computer mouse: it can move in two dimensions and click.


The hardware interfaces used in the BMI, neural electrodes (the one we used was the Utah mulitelectrode array), are not new. They have been around for decades. What is new are the algorithms that translate (or, as we refer to them, ""decode"") the brain signals into movement of the cursor. The machine learning decoding algorithms used in this study were ones that we developed recently ([cursor movement](http://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3265) and [click](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2582691) decoders) that significantly improve the performance of communication BMIs, enabling our monkeys to achieve rates that are 2-3 times faster than rates achievable with prior algorithms.


There is tons more we could write about (algorithm details, clinical trials that these findings have resulted in, what other medical conditions BMIs may help with, etc), but we'll stop here and open it up to you all for questions. We look forward to answering as many of your questions as possible!

**2PM PT - We are live!**

**6PM PT - We are done, thank you for the great questions!**

"Reddit decide my future! Pharmacy vs Engineering.College bound high school student here looking to go into UC San Diego with around $20,000 in grants according to my financial aid estimate. (Is that a lot, or is it common to get around that much?)

I don't know what to major in: Chemistry (to become a pharmacist) or Electrical engineering.

I'm familiar with both subjects, and I probably know more in engineering than in chemistry. (1 year of physics, 1 year of AP physics; 1 year of chemistry)

My interest is probably more towards engineering - I just find computers, circuits, and programming so cool. I am nowhere near good at any of these however, I only learned Visual Basic (which was really fun, though boring/frustrating at times) and soldered basic pre-built robots in physics classes.

I also like chemistry - aka the explosions and drugs science. I know the basics of chemistry: noble gases, electron configurations, valence electrons, compounds, mixtures, transition metals, etc,etc. I'm even familiar with a lot of the properties of elements which I self studied - for example potassium is very reactive to water and when made into an allow with sodium creates ""NaK"" which is explosive. If I take the chemistry route I will go into pharmacy (chemistry is the best route to pharm school, right?).

However, pharmacists make about double of what engineers make, plus they save lives more often than engineers do. There is a large demand for pharmacists, even more than engineers. The con is that they go to school for around 6 years, where as engineers go for 4-5 years.


Enough of my blabbering, what do you guys think I **should** do? It would be great to get a sense of what each job is like and the courseload for both/difficulty. Also the school I'm going to and if it is better for engineering or pharmacy. Sorry for the wall of text, but I'm just flipping out right now.

"I am Dr. Dante Lauretta, I study the chemistry of our solar system, extrasolar systems, and am building a robot to visit an asteroid and return a sample to Earth – the OSIRIS-REx NASA Mission, AMA!I’m Dante Lauretta, professor of Planetary Sciences at the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu/). I study the chemistry of planetary materials in our solar system and those around other stars. I am interested in the chemistry and mineralogy of asteroids and comets. I study these objects using planet formation theories, meteorite analysis, and spacecraft missions. 

I am in charge of NASA’s [OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission](http://www.asteroidmission.org) as Principal Investigator. OSIRIS-REx is a space mission to visit asteroid [Bennu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu), one of the most potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids. OSIRIS-REx will survey Bennu to assess its impact hazard and resource potential, understand its geology, and return a sample to Earth. We launch in 2016, rendezvous with Bennu in 2018, and return to Earth in 2023.  

I’m here at 1 PM EDT to answer your questions about solar and extrasolar system formation, asteroids, comets, meteorites, and what it’s like being in charge of a NASA Mission. 

Also, I invite everyone to send your name into space on the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft through our [Messages to Bennu](http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/messages/bennu/) campaign. Feel free to check out my blog [Life on the Asteroid Frontier](http://dslauretta.com/) as well!

**Edit** Thanks for the great AMA. I have to get back to work but will keep answering your questions throughout the day!

**Edit#2** Thanks for the continued interest! I am going out for a beer but will answer your questions when I get back - they may get more interesting after that . . .

**Edit#3** Answers to FAQs:

- What do I think about asteroid mining?

Asteroids like Bennu represent natural resources of near-Earth space, in the form of water, organics, and precious metals. There is potential for substantial economic development in follow-on exploration of these objects. Water and organics are useful for life support and rocket fuel and therefore would support a space-faring economy. The current business model for asteroid mining relies on a steady customer base for resources such as water and organic compounds in space. Such a venture may be feasible if international interest in space exploration continues to increase. Another angle on asteroid mining is to extract precious metals like platinum and return them to Earth. I calculate that a 10-meter asteroid is worth ~$10-million, with $9M in iron, nickel, and cobalt and $1M worth of platinum. Given that OSIRIS-REx costs $1-billion, we have long way to go before this business plan closes. What we really need to do is bring down the cost of accessing space. 


There are a couple of companies that are interested in asteroid mining and they are looking for talented people. If you are interested, they are hiring.

- What are the chances of finding a harmful bacteria/virus in the sample?

We consider this to be a very low probability event. We don’t expect any microorganisms on Bennu. It is too small and the radiation doses would kill anything living on the asteroid in a very short time. We had to prove this as part of our Planetary Protection rating – which is Unrestricted Earth Return - meaning that we do not have to take any special precautions to avoid contaminating the Earth with extraterrestrial life. Instead, we hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth. We will focus on measuring the organic molecular inventory of the samples but don’t have any plans for biological assays. We will keep the sample under nitrogen purge to avoid contaminating it with terrestrial microbes.

- How do I get a job in planetary science or working on a spacecraft mission?

I  describe my initial steps in my [Journey to the Asteroid Frontier - Part 1](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/06/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-1/) in one of my blog posts with a follow on in [Part 2](http://dslauretta.com/2013/12/17/my-journey-to-the-asteroid-frontier-part-2/). I was introduced to planetary science as an undergraduate at the University of Arizona when I received a NASA Undergraduate Research Space Grant to work on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The idea of communicating with an alien civilization across the vast expanse of space inspired me to pursue a career in planetary science. I focus on the formation of planets and the origin of life to understand the likelihood of alien life arising and evolving elsewhere in our universe.

As for young people wanting to get into this line of work - study hard and do well in school. Graduate high school and go to college. Find people with similar interests. Start with the basics – math and physics, then work your way up from there. Planetary science is multidisciplinary and requires knowledge of math, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, etc. Once in college, he should try to get a job in a research lab. Talk to scientists and engineers that are working on projects that interest and find ways to volunteer in their labs. Undergraduate research opportunities are key to getting needed experience for a job in the aerospace industry or for getting into a good graduate school. Be persistent, arrange for tours of local labs, and make it clear that you are interested and motivated to pursue a career in this field. Once you get the job, do it well and show initiative to move up to more responsibility.

I am optimistic about the future of space exploration for several reasons. First, despite budget cuts in recent years, the United States has a great space program with many exciting missions in the future including Mars 2020, the Europa Clipper, and, of course, OSIRIS-REx. In addition, other national space agencies are ramping up their programs including India, China, Russia, and the Europeans. Finally, I think we are starting to see some serious interest from industry in commercial development of space. If these companies take off then planetary scientists will be in high demand.

- What powers and propels OSIRIS-REx towards Bennu and how fast does it travel?

We have two solar arrays to provide power to the spacecraft. We have two Li-ion batteries to store power for periods when we are not in direct sunlight (such as during launch and sampling). The guidance system includes many components including star trackers, sun sensors, a laser range-finder, and on-board image processing capabilities. 
I describe the journey to Bennu, including details on the speeds involved in my blog post [How to Get to Bennu and Back](http://dslauretta.com/2013/11/27/how-to-get-to-bennu-and-back/). We will leave Earth with a hyperbolic escape velocity of 5.4 km/s (over 12,000 mph) on an Atlas V rocket. We will sneak up on Bennu with a relative approach velocity of 20 cm/s (~0.45 mph). When we return to Earth the sample return capsule will hit the top of the atmosphere with a speed of 12.4 km/s (27,738 mph). 

- How much sample will we collect, what do we hope to find in the asteroid sample and how will we analyze it?

The baseline science requirement is 60 grams (about 2 ounces) of asteroid regolith. However, we also have to be able to measure the amount of sample collected before we stow the sample collector in the return capsule. We measure the moment of inertia of the spacecraft both before and after sample acquisition. It turns out that this technique has a measurement uncertainty of 90 grams (3-sigma). Therefore, our sample collector (TAGSAM) is required to pick up 150 grams of material. Under optimum conditions, TAGSAM can pick up two kilograms of material. We have the capability to attempt sample collection three times. However, we hope to get enough sample on the first attempt. The second two are backup options in case the first attempt does not pick up enough material. 

The primary objective of OSIRIS-REx is to return pristine carbonaceous material from the early Solar System. Spectral analysis of Bennu suggests that it is similar on composition to the very rare CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. These rocks are rich in organic compounds and water-bearing minerals like clays. We hope to find organic molecules that may have led to the origin of life on Earth and inform the likelihood that life may have originated elsewhere in our solar system. The team’s sample analysis objectives are distributed among five broad categories, based on analytical techniques. These are: mineralogy & petrology, elemental & isotopic composition, organic chemistry, spectral properties, and thermal properties. We use a wide variety of techniques including NanoSIMS, transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, mass spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, synchrotron particle accelerators, thermal conductivity analyzers, and laboratory spectrometers.

"Science AMA Series: I'm David DeSteno, professor of psychology at Northeastern University. I study how human emotions shape our decisions and build virtue. Ask me anything!Hi Reddit! I’m David DeSteno, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, editor-in-chief of the American Psychological Association’s journal Emotion, and author of The Truth About Trust [Hudson Street Press, 2014.]
(http://www.davedesteno.com/the-truth-about-trust)

For the past two decades, I’ve been fascinated by how, when, and why emotions shape our decisions, especially those that have to do with vice and virtue. Whether we’re examining hypocrisy and compassion, pride and punishment, cheating and trust, my research group’s work continually shows that human moral behavior is much more variable than most would predict.

One of my primary goals is to figure out how to leverage emotion-based mechanisms of the mind to help individuals make better decisions and, hopefully along the way, to nudge the greater good. Along those lines, here’s info about some of my most recent work. I’d be happy to hear your thoughts and questions about these, or anything else (including the process of scientific review, in my role as editor, given the many stories about scientific fraud and failures of data to replicate we’ve seen in the news lately).

• Whether we call it self-control, grit, or the like, the ability to delay gratification is central to success, as you may have learned via the famous Marshmallow Test. But how do you gain self-control? For centuries, the supposed answer was easy: use willpower to control your desires by squelching your emotions. In my brand new cover story for [Pacific Standard magazine, published today, I’ll show you why that view is incorrect.](http://www.psmag.com/?p=89456)

• Can you tell if a stranger is trustworthy? To date, most methods have failed (the TSA’s recent $40 million program was shown to be virtually useless). These repeated failures don’t occur because it’s impossible, but rather because we’ve been going about it in the wrong way. Here’s a video of our most recent work showing how to detect trustworthiness [using humanoid robots to boot!](http://hbr.org/video/3166586123001/trustworthy-signals)

• Many spiritual leaders like the Dalai Lama talk about how compassion can increase well-being, and how compassion can spread virally and reduce suffering. But do these claims have any scientific basis? We think they do. You can check out a video of me talking about why, or read pieces I’ve written on compassion and mindfulness for the [New York Times 1,]
