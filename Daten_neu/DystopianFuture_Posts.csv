"Making my own Dystopian Universe**This is not apart of the tutorial/guide I've been making in my last few posts. Although the creative process is the same.**

**This post may contain sensitive materials. Although safe for work, and completely relative to the sub, this post contains some extremist ideologies that I do NOT associate with. This is all for a fictional work of dystopian art. Viewer discretion is advised**

&#x200B;

If you've been keeping up with my guide, you'd know that the first step to creating a functional universe or writing is the concept. I'll stay with the concept of ""a normal town with a dark secret."" This isn't really complex and while it has a bit of depth, it's still an okay concept and still can easily be expanded upon.

Let's start easy, the crucial steps to a dystopia, as I've listed in a similar comment on another post

* **Public Support** \-- You'll need the support of the public to stay in power, else you'll be overrun)
* **Civil Enforcement** \-- Even if you have Public Support, some people will see through the system, so it's nice to have a civil enforcement for your civilians to look up to as well as to weed out the ""Supposed Evil""
* **A supposed evil** \-- As a ruler, you'll want to comfort your citizens and make them despise a supposed evil that are mainly people who rebel, to instill hate against those who rebel and stability within your community. (Nazi Germany is an example of this.)
* **Civil Unrest** \-- How scared/doubtful are you citizens and how can you reassure them?
* **Cultures** \-- You will want to be able to differentiate your citizens from outsiders as well as make them feel apart of the community you've established.

These factors will all be extremely important in the making of my dystopia and when I need to, I'll get in depth of how all of these factors will be incorporated.

Now with the concept of ""a normal town with a dark secret."" we'll need to actually create the dark secret. After a few minutes of thinking, there are many possible ways I can portray this. It could be an entire dictatorship, a police state, a bio-mechanical entity insisting on creating the town as if a cycle in a machine. I mean literally anything. But in my creative process, I appeal towards things that seem normalised, despite being obviously wicked or wrong. For this purpose I want my obviously wicked plot to be a mysterious alien benefactor that guides and controls our living.

This took me a lot of time to think out and even with muses and inspiring sources, so if you're trying to follow in my footsteps this post, don't be alarmed. So to expand further upon my idea, my society would be an alien race of hive minds controlling the human beings in a small town basically indoctrinating them not by mind control but by the simple process of normalisation. By being friendly and inviting to the humans, they are able to introduce **Culture** and gain **Public Support** from their community. As you can see, 2 of the 5 elements have already been added within the introduction! But how these things will be expanded upon is an entirely different story.

**-----** **Basic Ideas of my Universe (Culture/Basic Ideas)**

What **Culture** does these aliens hive minds have? Well, since I want the town to contain a dark secret, I would have to make the alien culture, extreme and very disturbing. Since its a hive mind, I guess automation would have to be the go to on their culture. Although if the hive-mind wants to take control, they'll have to introduce their culture as a Utopian way of life for people to actually believe and love the change. What I have planned is to have the culture imitate a Utopia where currency isn't an issue. Everyone is given exquisite dinners at the same time and everyone follows the same routine with no class or hierarchy. Everyone is treated the same and acts the same with no individuality and no differences (its a hive-mind, duh). The environment will consist of the same housing, same gardening, and cities will be divided into perfect percentages of suburban, luxury goods and industrial sections to maximise efficiency of the town.

Industrial sections will consist of machines which produce the essentials and luxury goods which are perfectly tailored to help in the indoctrinating process (propaganda in the forums of toys, books etc.) controlled by basic office jobs such as accounting, coding and even the writing of the propaganda, all while using their culture to gain popularity and public support.

**----- Dystopian Details (Civil Enforcement Design/Dystopian Aspects)**

Now lets move onto a different section of the 5 elements of dystopia. Civil Enforcement and Civil Unrest. **Civil Enforcement** as well as **Public Support** and **Culture** all contribute to Civil Unrest. If Civil Enforcement doesn't do it's job well enough, it may give people fear of criminals and a feeling of being unsafe thus raising the Unrest. If the Public Support is too low, people might want to have change or have doubts about the leadership of the hive mind thus again, causing higher unrest. Finally if the culture isn't appealing or doesn't seem to appeal or unite the community, people will prefer other cultures causing a divide which obviously a hive mind won't want. But lets just say that **Public Support** and **Culture** are dealt with. We'll have to make the Civil Enforcement.

I want my civil enforcement to maintain a disturbing side and a appealing side both in physical appearance and in mentality. A nice *Civil Protector of the Law!* aesthetic while maintaining the *Killer Robot Hive Mind*. So my design or creative process of this character is a bio-mechanical entity. A robot with human features, maybe a human with gears and cogs  working with their organs and some limbs replaced with mechanics. A comedic porcelain mask (I'm sorry but Being Pretty's mask idea is just genius) to cover up the disfigured face to give the impression of a friendly yet disturbing figure. 

But you may be thinking; ***who's gonna feel safe with a siren head looking mother-fucker outside your house patroling the streets?*** Easy! Remember the element of **Culture** I mentioned above about toys and books? By using toys to make children believe that these mutated creatures believe that the civil enforcers are safe and harmless to citizens, although are able to repel the thought of the **Supposed Evil** element which if made correctly, is supposed to be hated by the community and thought of as a wrench that needs to be taken out of the cogs that is the automation cycle. The community, as they get used to the hive mind will accept these patrolers and treat them like heroes or as a cop whose saved the day.

**----- The Supposed Evil**

I'd like to reiterate for this section that this is not my real life belief, but it is the belief of the hive mind I'm trying to portray. They have these beliefs, not me personally.

The supposed evil is supposed to be an individual or group who breaks the automated cycle that the hive minds try to create. Be it a different religion, culture or just being a different individual than what they want you as.

The point I'm trying to convey is written all over my concept and how I've chosen to expand it. I want a society based on what would be considered the most efficient way to live or the best Utopia or way to live by the perspective of an alien species. There isn't much to say about who and how the **Supposed evil** is targeted, so I'll leave it at this.

Now for what happens to the supposed evil. I have 2 ideas of what I could do with the Supposed Evil of this universe, but I want to retain the element of them being taken out of the society's cogs. I have an idea to either turn them into new cogs and gears by reinventing them into the **Civil Enforcers** or by simply killing them off in execution. There are going to be multiple kinds of people that will not be up to the Hive Mind's society's standards so there will be a bunch of people in these camps. But there will be the old cogs that either aren't able to work anymore (Injured, Crippled) or have served their purpose by living the ideal life of growing up, working to provide for their family and raise their child to eventually replace them. These elderly have served their purpose and might as well be renewed as new cogs, like I stated earlier. They'll be made into the street patrolling Civil Enforcement.

**---- The End**

Thats all for now. I might make new posts updating this but thank you for reading. (I've contacted an artist and might be able to post concept art, so thats exciting!

I'd also like to remind you that I got all of this from just a simple ""a normal town with a dark secret."" prompt. With your own concepts like this, you could possibly create better or more appealing stories!

San Francisco police propose using robots capable of ‘deadly force’ | San Francisco
We are the parallel world of other parallel worlds
"[Law/Story] For both Wacky Wednesday Law and Story TimeYou wake up to the noise of a engine rolling. As you open your eyes you see that you’re in a sort of glass pod. A overlay projects itself onto the glass above your head, and plays a video. A women somewhere in her mid 40s appears on screen, and starts:

“Good day participant A-013, you are the 13th alpha tester of our new pre-rebirth tutorial. You may be confused as to how you got here... you have died. You spent too much of your time. But you wouldn’t remember any of it. By random selection you have been luckily chosen to alpha test our new tutorial. This should teach you the rules and laws about the new world you are going into.”

The screen quickly flashes with a pop up.

“I-I can’t read this ma’am” you stutter as you stare at the meaningless shapes.

A minute goes by with plain silence, but then a masculine, but yet robotic voice responds through a staticky speaker:

“Of course you can’t, as you haven’t paid access to literacy.”

“Oh... okay? How do I—“

“How long do you plan to live?” the voice interrupts.

“Uh... what kind of question is that? I-I don’t know? How would I know!? Just give me the average... I guess?”

Silence

“Thank you for your cooperation, you have chosen to live for 583.7 years. As by protocol, I am required to ask if you would like to buy any life improvement skills, rights, or objects? That would include literacy, cooking, basic human rights, housing, pets, social class, appearance, family, thought processes, and the like.”

“Wait... what?” you ask confused.

“It is exactly as I said.”

“But how-no... what is any of that?”

“Would like to purchase the basic knowledge package?”

“With what? I don’t have anything to give in return.”

“Oh you do... You can use your life as collateral.”

“What?! That’s-that’s insane! What the hell! Who in their right mind would do that?!”

“Plenty do.”

“How long... would the package cost?”

“10.99 years for the package alone, but if you buy high social class with it the total would be 17.89 instead of the total of 19.99.”

“I... guess I’ll buy it?” you hesitate not knowing the consequences.

A minute of silence goes by, as the voice leaves you alone with your thoughts. It feels like an eternity before you feel a quick jolt of pain at your lower back forcing you to whimper. You subconsciously try to reach towards the spot, but you get held back by metal restraints. As you relax you realize it, you suddenly know things that you didn’t before. It’s some sort of miracle! Looking around the room the once meaningless shapes morph into legible text. But you wonder, where’s the voice?

“Heeelloo?” you announce, but to which there is no reply.

Staring back at the screen that was in front of you, you realize the pop up was to confirm if you want to continue. You tap the button labeled, “Continue” using the pad next to your hand, but nothing happened.

“Is it frozen?” you wonder.

That would make sense considering the tutorial is still in alpha testing. You shout, yelling that the machine is frozen just to get somebody’s, anybody’s reaction, but to which there is no reply. All you can do is wait.

After 2 hours of agonizing immobility you are done waiting. You wiggle and squirm, trying everything you can do you escape the restraints, but they won’t budge. Then you come up with an idea... 

“Hey!” you shout, hoping that the computer could still hear you.

“I don’t how many years it’ll cost, but I will buy my release from this pod!” you order.

A minute goes by with nothing, just more silence. It appears that this is the end, you’ve tried everything you could. You lay in wait, trying to accept that this is where you will spend the rest of eternity. But exactly 9 minutes later, the restraints become suddenly cold and could fall apart easily whenever you moved. Soon after, the pod slowly opens up into a small white room.  

“Where do I go?” you ask yourself, but the obvious answer is to open the door.

You slowly get up, stretching out your arms and legs. You look around at the walls of the room, there is nothing just thoroughly clean and pristine white. You walk up to the door, and reach for the handle. You twist and push the door, which opens to a dark hallway. You get the feeling that you shouldn’t be there, but your curiosity pushes you forward. You look down one side of the hallway, but you see nothing almost as if it continues forever. The other side of hallway though, has a door. You slowly creep towards the end with a door, and attempt to sneakily open it.

“HEY! What do you think your doing in here.” a mysterious figure shouts at you.

“You haven’t paid any time!” it continues.

The mysterious figure is obviously angered by your misdoing.

“I don’t want to do this, but by law order 76: any and all trespassing to regions a buyer has not paid for is automatic consent to the purchase of the questioned region at double the price. That means you owe 500,000 years, you’re in really big trouble...” the mysterious figure concludes.

Before you knew it, everything went dark. You are now in the void of true death. When your debt becomes so over bearing that you cannot repay it in future lives."
"The Proud Cats At The P*U*C*C Finally Put Their Paws Down”” 

**I wrote this after much thought about the inter-related world of civilians, societal leaders, geopolitics, pandemics and international trade. But at it’s core, all these things are instances of social interaction. Social interaction is largely is about the contested world of forming narratives, and he who tells the best stories wins. He who wins long term, creates cultural norms which are by nature tough to budge.** **What is ‘Culture’ other than embedded stories we all tell ourselves each other, over and over, without much or indeed** ***any*** **thought.** **I now fully recognize the art of “telling stories” determines what gets done and by who, who leads and who follows. In other words the ancient tradition of storytelling lives on in its beauty and pre-eminence more than it ever did, and also if we are not careful bad culture comes as a growing weed along the fence, avenue, town, city, nation and finally the World.**

**Proof of this constant need for narrative and storytelling has been seen during the heavy lockdown period in 2020-21 coupled with a period of not-seen-since-the-1930-s media and tech giant censorship. A totally new environment of “the pandemic” required demand for a new both local and world narrative. So I wasn’t so surprised when opening a web browser and seeing Orwell’s** ***1984*** **and Huxley’s** ***Brave New World*** **were at the top of Amazons fiction list of best sellers. In this state of flux, people are scrambling for good storytellers to tell them what’s happening and how to act.** **In many an eye of the public today, the dystopian future outlined in these books** ***1984*** **and** ***BNW*** **is now happening**. **We** **feel a distinct flavor of Authoritarianism, and these famous ‘storytelling’ books** ***1984*** **and** ***BNW*** **of course are also a message to the future, the future we are now in 72 and 83 years after they were written. It is not** **so surprising a fact these books ring true, given Orwell and Huxley were gaining much knowledge of the Authoritarian times they lived in, coupled with the** ***History Rhymes*** **thesis**.

**So** **the best story wins, and in the Western World at least, Huxley and Orwell have the best story about the nature and future of Authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, that why they were and are still again bestsellers. In 2021 we live in a world which seems to approximate these two books. In the future, if history is not fully erased, we will be known as the people who fought off Totalitarian disaster and World War, only to decades later throw away all for a few inflation reducing bucks and a few obselete-ing foreign made widgets. I haven’t mentioned ‘Animal farm’ which is probably very silly as my short story and the themes are more obviously similar to that Orwell novella. I will thank these three books and these two men, for the unknown guiding hand that helps move the pen when I talk of dystopian and authoritarian subjects.**

**I will speak no more, as you more than get my drift. I don’t claim to be anywhere as good as these two writers, I am a beginner or at best a sophomore writer who is probably emerged in too much silliness. However Orwell and Huxley are a great inspiration for me personally to attempt meaningful fiction, which I hope to achieve on some level in the future.**

**I’m sure when all is said and done, the animals will have a better plan for us all.**

**P.s. I cant help but think of the BNW theme where society programs people to die exactly at age 60, the logical point where the societal dependency and reducing economic value began to become ‘a problem’ (& by the way, is coffee the new** ***soma*****)**?

“**“The Proud Cats At The P\*U\*C\*C Finally Put Their Paws Down”**” – A Short Story by Martin Anton Smith 2021.

My Cat, being Conservative by nature, always wears an old world formal dining coat.

It’s Coal black with highlights of the finest Aegean sea tortoiseshell.

It fits perfectly as one piece, with the only gaps being the most physically necessary ones.

He does not, of course have a dull cat name like Tom, Mittens or Timmy.

He has a wide range of titles bestowed upon him by the finest chaps and chap-ess’s.

They are: Squeaky, Sir Squeaky, King Squeaky, His Nibs, Squeak Chop, Sir Squeeksalot.

These Titles, he advises me, are from his esteemed fellows from the strictly exclusive ‘ Pragmatic Utilitarianism Cats Club’.

Often out of Nowhere, he will say “I’m off the P.U.C.C., don’t wait up”

“Me and the ‘Cool Cat’s’ will Talk Geopolitics all night”.

To which I mentally squash the obvious childish retort of “But I thought Cat’s were lone wolves”?.

A cat of Sir Squeeky’s class, would always despise such time wasteful comedy, especially while on the way out the door.

As King Squeaky always looks resplendent, and is as organized and on-time as a German train, he is not one to mess around getting ready.

I hear the door slam shut, followed by a muffled goodbye of “toodoloo!”, followed by the slowly reducing sound of paw steps on the crunchy driveway gravel.

After somewhat feeling jealous of Sir Squeek’s upper crust social life, I retreat to my bedside reading: The books title is “China Now Owns The World, SO NOW GET USED TO IT”.

The hours pass, and I wonder how His Nibs the cat-about-town, is getting on. Then exhausted from the days running around, my eyes droop and I fall into a deep sleep.

The next afternoon Sir Squeeky opens the door and meanders in to the living room almost as slow as a turtle dawdling along on a beach.

He’s before me in the living room, eyes half closed as he has been up all night yakking at the exclusive Pragmatic Utilitarianism Cats Club – or “The P.U.C.C. or more simply spoken as “The Puk”.

“taking my opportunity for a sneaky quip I cheerily utter ” Look what the Cat dragged in; how was the Club”?

Squeaky ignores the ill mannered quip and replies perfunctorily.

“Well, we talked and decided the China problem is ok for us Cats, but extinction-ally bad for Humans, so I’m concordantly content”

“But what about shipping delays” I say, “their will be undoubted delays in your finest branded Cat Biscuits – RegalCataBix”

To which “His Nibbs” replies – “It’s sorted we’ve organized an alternate secondary shipping backup via the ex Cape Horn Spice trail and the boats are all manned and manufactured by craftsman felines”.

Again I squash the obvious quip “I thought cats hate water” and I ask “what about delays regarding sardine smelt production from Canada”, I rebut.

To which Squeak Chop dismissively replies:

“I and the P.U.C.C can get it fresh fish from the mountain stream at the next village, you dunderhead! canned sardines pffft as if, OUTRAGEOUS!”

Sir Squeaksalot starts grooming his paws nonchalantly, exuding his usual unflappability under fire.

Continuing my line of questioning I say “And so you talked about the Pandemic? So what if you Cat’s all get sick?

Squeeky looks at me with the same disdain the Queen might if a politician had upon greeting had hugged her instead of bowing politely.

“That ridiculous, we can’t get sick from something we developed ourselves in our virology labs along with the antidote”

Quite stupefied, I ask him “Are you saying you elite cats down at the P.U.C.C developed this virus in the lab, in order to do away with all Earths people”

“Sir Squeaky pawed his whiskers, that’s exactly what I’m saying, and I’m dreadfully sorry on a personal level, as you’ve been a good foot soldier for me around this joint, but we at P.U.C.C are a pragmatic and utilitarian bunch – we couldn’t take any more silliness, you were all feeding us a far too limited diet, and making the air far too dirty to breath, so much so half of us now have asthma. On top of that our coats were becoming grimey and that simply wont do. We had to put our paws down.”

To which I protested: “But you get the best quality biscuits, I feed you beef bits from the butchery, full cream milk and even some shaved deli ham on occasion”

“Yes, of course – you have been good my dear boy – it’s the rest of humanity we made this call for – you will unfortunately be what’s called ‘collateral damage”

“Collateral damage” how could you be so cold Sir Squeeksalot? After all these years”

“3 to be Exact”, he firmly retorts. “Well as I said, dear boy, it was a tough decision, not taken lightly and we spent all night on it, and it could have gone either way at any moment.”

I was about to further protest when a firm “Knock Knock Knock” cut out our conversation.

“Special delivery for Sir Squueksalot – paw print required”

I opened the door, and Squeeky jumps up on top the box the delivery man is holding. He proudly thrusts his somewhat oversize paw to the mans digital scanner, he scans it with a “boop-bip” sound, says a robotic “thankyou”, and leaves in a flash.

Then in a blur Squeeky cuts through the carton with a deft flick of an un-retracted claw, the top box flaps open to expose a small ray gun which seems to have a handle which has been molded especially for a cats paw.

Before I know it, I see Sir Squeeky point the ray gun at my head and he says “This is harder on me than it is for you sonny”.

I am swiftly encapsulated in an otherworldly green glow of visible plasma particles. It’s like I’m looking out into distant space from the surface of Alpha Centuri.

Time seems to slow to a halt for what seems like an eternity, then in the blink of am eye, all’s normal again.

For some reason I have a monstrous craving desire for ‘RegalCatabix’, some fresh Canadian smelt all washed down with a saucer full to the brim of full cream milk ‘.

I squash the acute hunger as I see Sir Squeaksalot peering at me with that common cat look of squinted half closed eyes – though this time our eyes are equal level with each other.

As the reality begins to set in, my rising anger erupts ….I open my mouth to aggressively chastise Sir Squeeksalot and ask him to reverse whatever in hells name he’s done to me with that green plasma ray gun.

I open my mouth to let out the words, but to my surprise instead of my human voice all I hear is elongated unhappy screechy sounds:

Meoooooow ……Meeeooooowwww……..Meeeeeooooooowwwwwwww.

I am about to look around and find where the feral cat is hiding – perhaps behind the couch? Then it dawns on me.

Sir Squeaky has turned me into a cat, so as to save me from the Cat-in-the-Lab designed ‘Killer Human Virus’. The Virus that would abruptly solve all of the Earth’s man made problems.

I look sheepishly at Squeeky, he looks back in a grandfatherly-wise way and says hypnotically and with gravitas:

“It’ll take you a while to get used to your voice box and speak Cat English again, but me and the Cat’s at of the P.U.C.C will teach you everything we know”. As a tear appears in my eye he swipes my face with claws fully retracted, as says ye-olden-days speak: NOW KEEP A STIFF UPPER WHISKER AND FOR SPHINX’S SAKE CARRY ON – YOU’RE A CAT NOW”

I pawed the tears streaming from my now wide yellow cat’s eye’s. Soon my spirits began to lift as I realized how lucky I was to have Sir Squeaky save me from a certain viral death.

I no longer had to worry about the deadly ‘Man Virus’ and I could live in a paradise in a world ran by Cats running of the philosophe of “Pragmatic Utilitarianism”.

I was now an ‘insider’ cat, controlled by the strongest paws and the best minds of the P.U.CC. Soon no doubt I’d be inaugurated as a fully fledged member of P.U.C.C., and no doubt would be asked by His Nibs to jointly head the committee which will manage world affairs in lieu of those dumb humans. I mean what could possibly go wrong?

Sir Squeaky then wheeled out a platform with at least 30 large red books.

“Now we have to get you schooled up of the ideology principles and methods of the P.U.C.C. system- start with Vol 1.”

Sir Squeeks pawed off one of the books from the platform, and it landed with a thud in front of my nose. I looked at the front cover. It read as the following

“P.U.C.C. MANEFESTO Vol 1 – A NEW WORLD DIGITAL CURRENCY – THE PURRCOIN”.

Then uncontrollably, my furry stomach started revolving, like the rolling waves on the open seas. Then I started rocking to and fro, violently like a sailboat in a storm in the roaring 40’s. Then I broke out into a drenching sweat, I could see my fur clumping together through my now salty sweat addled eyes. As ill as I felt, I could hear King Squeaky mumble over and over: “Oh no, not again, this theoretically shouldn’t even be possible…dear oh dear…somethings wrong with the plasma re-orienter settings, those bloody P.U.C.C. techs are useless…useless…USELESS!”

I thought it was over when a paw toe suddenly turned into my old human pinky finger, then it popped back to a paw toe, then a finger, then back again. Then horribly the same thing happened to my head. The whole upsetting experience lasted no longer than five minutes, then I was once again fine and fully formed. I was a healthy normal cat.

His Nibs sat me down and gave me a warm saucer of full cream milk, to settle my nerves after this harrowing trial. I said nothing and listened to his soothing words.

“Don’t worry, these teething issues occur initially, the ray gun plasma blast is 100% healthy. Your mild symptoms are merely a small technical hurdle the nerd cats at P.U.C.C. haven’t ironed out yet. This wont effect anything. For the moment just follow this process that has been rubber stamped by the highest P.U.C.C. committee, which you will be happy to know I also reside on as Chairman.

“One – avoid large gatherings or anywhere where you cannot reach a bathroom stall within 3-5 minutes. In other words no sports games or concerts, automobile trips etc.

Two – the signal to hide yourself away in a bathroom stall will occur when your tummy starts revolving, you of course must get to the bathroom stall before your head starts to flip between your normal cat’s head and your old human head. You must understand If anyone who is not a part of P.U.C.C sees a cat with a human head, the P.U.C.C. will be shut down. We cannot under any circumstances let that happen.

Three – when safely hidden from prying eyes inside the stall, you will wait the remaining minute or two till its all over, perhaps 5 to be safe, then you can rejoin the prior activity with no one the wiser”.

I was finally feeling a bit less worried when he kindly added “If you follow this process there wont be any problems, and of course you can still potentially be a member of the P.U.C.C. and I’ll make sure I’ll keep a guiding eye on you until our best P.U.C.C. Ape-to-Cat Reconfiguration Technicians resolve the problem”.

With Sir Squeaky’s increasingly calming words, I knew I was in good hands. I didn’t protest, I smiled obediently and wiggled my whiskers joyfully. Now was the time to begin psychologically preparing myself for a whole new post-human existence. After all, What else was I to do? Go back to being a human being who would be wiped out by cat instigated virus? Never! I wouldn’t dare squander the gift of life Sir Squeaky had manifestly bestowed upon me.

I reached my paw out for the well bound, red leather cover of the P.U.C.C. Manifesto. After all I had so much study to do. Sir Squeaky casually ambled over to sit on his favourite grey furry blanket, that overhung the base of the couch. He turned around twice the settled and went to sleep almost instantly. His purrs rung out loudly as I turned over the first gilded page.

THE END"
"Theme Discussion: Technological DystopiaSociety is controlled by various technological advances. This could be through robots, artificial intelligence, computers, and other various technologies. Constant citizen surveillance could be possible through different electronic devices. Online usage can both highly monitored and highly restricted. Perhaps it is only the elite that can use the internet while the citizens must earn allotted time. 

There are many elements and hypothetical situations that could fall under this category. An AI takeover is a theory in which artificial intelligence (AI) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, with computers or robots effectively taking the control of the planet away from the human species.

Imagine robot police force in suburban regions to enforce the laws of the land. Robots don't require salaries, food, drink, etc so they could be on patrol 24/7. A connection device from the vehicle recharges the robot each time the vehicle is in motion. Drones could monitor from the sky. All in the name of safety.

There may be some sort of virtual space in which people resort to this technological medium for communication, connection, and gatherings. The reduction in real-time correspondence will lead to further isolation while presenting as a convenient way to instantly connect with others. Constant surveillance is probable. On the other hand, this virtual space could also be used as a means for prison ""cells"" for harsher societies. 

In August 2007, David Nye presented the idea of cyber-dystopia, which envisions a world made worse by technological advancements. Cyber-dystopias center around the principles of the individual losing control, becoming dependent and being unable to stop change. Nye describes a society where the elite use technology to oppress and control mass groups of people. He also presents technology as a form of false hope; promising success and change, but causing pain and inconvenience when that goal is not reached. 

Some examples of this type of theme would be:

- The Matrix

- The Fifth Element

- Blade Runner

- 12 Monkeys

- The Hunger Games"

“**“The Proud Cats At The P\*U\*C\*C Finally Put Their Paws Down”**” – A Short Story by Martin Anton Smith 2021.

My Cat, being Conservative by nature, always wears an old world formal dining coat.

It’s Coal black with highlights of the finest Aegean sea tortoiseshell.

It fits perfectly as one piece, with the only gaps being the most physically necessary ones.

He does not, of course have a dull cat name like Tom, Mittens or Timmy.

He has a wide range of titles bestowed upon him by the finest chaps and chap-ess’s.

They are: Squeaky, Sir Squeaky, King Squeaky, His Nibs, Squeak Chop, Sir Squeeksalot.

These Titles, he advises me, are from his esteemed fellows from the strictly exclusive ‘ Pragmatic Utilitarianism Cats Club’.

Often out of Nowhere, he will say “I’m off the P.U.C.C., don’t wait up”

“Me and the ‘Cool Cat’s’ will Talk Geopolitics all night”.

To which I mentally squash the obvious childish retort of “But I thought Cat’s were lone wolves”?.

A cat of Sir Squeeky’s class, would always despise such time wasteful comedy, especially while on the way out the door.

As King Squeaky always looks resplendent, and is as organized and on-time as a German train, he is not one to mess around getting ready.

I hear the door slam shut, followed by a muffled goodbye of “toodoloo!”, followed by the slowly reducing sound of paw steps on the crunchy driveway gravel.

After somewhat feeling jealous of Sir Squeek’s upper crust social life, I retreat to my bedside reading: The books title is “China Now Owns The World, SO NOW GET USED TO IT”.

The hours pass, and I wonder how His Nibs the cat-about-town, is getting on. Then exhausted from the days running around, my eyes droop and I fall into a deep sleep.

The next afternoon Sir Squeeky opens the door and meanders in to the living room almost as slow as a turtle dawdling along on a beach.

He’s before me in the living room, eyes half closed as he has been up all night yakking at the exclusive Pragmatic Utilitarianism Cats Club – or “The P.U.C.C. or more simply spoken as “The Puk”.

“taking my opportunity for a sneaky quip I cheerily utter ” Look what the Cat dragged in; how was the Club”?

Squeaky ignores the ill mannered quip and replies perfunctorily.

“Well, we talked and decided the China problem is ok for us Cats, but extinction-ally bad for Humans, so I’m concordantly content”

“But what about shipping delays” I say, “their will be undoubted delays in your finest branded Cat Biscuits – RegalCataBix”

To which “His Nibbs” replies – “It’s sorted we’ve organized an alternate secondary shipping backup via the ex Cape Horn Spice trail and the boats are all manned and manufactured by craftsman felines”.

Again I squash the obvious quip “I thought cats hate water” and I ask “what about delays regarding sardine smelt production from Canada”, I rebut.

To which Squeak Chop dismissively replies:

“I and the P.U.C.C can get it fresh fish from the mountain stream at the next village, you dunderhead! canned sardines pffft as if, OUTRAGEOUS!”

Sir Squeaksalot starts grooming his paws nonchalantly, exuding his usual unflappability under fire.

Continuing my line of questioning I say “And so you talked about the Pandemic? So what if you Cat’s all get sick?

Squeeky looks at me with the same disdain the Queen might if a politician had upon greeting had hugged her instead of bowing politely.

“That ridiculous, we can’t get sick from something we developed ourselves in our virology labs along with the antidote”

Quite stupefied, I ask him “Are you saying you elite cats down at the P.U.C.C developed this virus in the lab, in order to do away with all Earths people”

“Sir Squeaky pawed his whiskers, that’s exactly what I’m saying, and I’m dreadfully sorry on a personal level, as you’ve been a good foot soldier for me around this joint, but we at P.U.C.C are a pragmatic and utilitarian bunch – we couldn’t take any more silliness, you were all feeding us a far too limited diet, and making the air far too dirty to breath, so much so half of us now have asthma. On top of that our coats were becoming grimey and that simply wont do. We had to put our paws down.”

To which I protested: “But you get the best quality biscuits, I feed you beef bits from the butchery, full cream milk and even some shaved deli ham on occasion”

“Yes, of course – you have been good my dear boy – it’s the rest of humanity we made this call for – you will unfortunately be what’s called ‘collateral damage”

“Collateral damage” how could you be so cold Sir Squeeksalot? After all these years”

“3 to be Exact”, he firmly retorts. “Well as I said, dear boy, it was a tough decision, not taken lightly and we spent all night on it, and it could have gone either way at any moment.”

I was about to further protest when a firm “Knock Knock Knock” cut out our conversation.

“Special delivery for Sir Squueksalot – paw print required”

I opened the door, and Squeeky jumps up on top the box the delivery man is holding. He proudly thrusts his somewhat oversize paw to the mans digital scanner, he scans it with a “boop-bip” sound, says a robotic “thankyou”, and leaves in a flash.

Then in a blur Squeeky cuts through the carton with a deft flick of an un-retracted claw, the top box flaps open to expose a small ray gun which seems to have a handle which has been molded especially for a cats paw.

Before I know it, I see Sir Squeeky point the ray gun at my head and he says “This is harder on me than it is for you sonny”.

I am swiftly encapsulated in an otherworldly green glow of visible plasma particles. It’s like I’m looking out into distant space from the surface of Alpha Centuri.

Time seems to slow to a halt for what seems like an eternity, then in the blink of am eye, all’s normal again.

For some reason I have a monstrous craving desire for ‘RegalCatabix’, some fresh Canadian smelt all washed down with a saucer full to the brim of full cream milk ‘.

I squash the acute hunger as I see Sir Squeaksalot peering at me with that common cat look of squinted half closed eyes – though this time our eyes are equal level with each other.

As the reality begins to set in, my rising anger erupts ….I open my mouth to aggressively chastise Sir Squeeksalot and ask him to reverse whatever in hells name he’s done to me with that green plasma ray gun.

I open my mouth to let out the words, but to my surprise instead of my human voice all I hear is elongated unhappy screechy sounds:

Meoooooow ……Meeeooooowwww……..Meeeeeooooooowwwwwwww.

I am about to look around and find where the feral cat is hiding – perhaps behind the couch? Then it dawns on me.

Sir Squeaky has turned me into a cat, so as to save me from the Cat-in-the-Lab designed ‘Killer Human Virus’. The Virus that would abruptly solve all of the Earth’s man made problems.

I look sheepishly at Squeeky, he looks back in a grandfatherly-wise way and says hypnotically and with gravitas:

“It’ll take you a while to get used to your voice box and speak Cat English again, but me and the Cat’s at of the P.U.C.C will teach you everything we know”. As a tear appears in my eye he swipes my face with claws fully retracted, as says ye-olden-days speak: NOW KEEP A STIFF UPPER WHISKER AND FOR SPHINX’S SAKE CARRY ON – YOU’RE A CAT NOW”

I pawed the tears streaming from my now wide yellow cat’s eye’s. Soon my spirits began to lift as I realized how lucky I was to have Sir Squeaky save me from a certain viral death.

I no longer had to worry about the deadly ‘Man Virus’ and I could live in a paradise in a world ran by Cats running of the philosophe of “Pragmatic Utilitarianism”.

I was now an ‘insider’ cat, controlled by the strongest paws and the best minds of the P.U.CC. Soon no doubt I’d be inaugurated as a fully fledged member of P.U.C.C., and no doubt would be asked by His Nibs to jointly head the committee which will manage world affairs in lieu of those dumb humans. I mean what could possibly go wrong?

Sir Squeaky then wheeled out a platform with at least 30 large red books.

“Now we have to get you schooled up of the ideology principles and methods of the P.U.C.C. system- start with Vol 1.”

Sir Squeeks pawed off one of the books from the platform, and it landed with a thud in front of my nose. I looked at the front cover. It read as the following

“P.U.C.C. MANEFESTO Vol 1 – A NEW WORLD DIGITAL CURRENCY – THE PURRCOIN”.

Then uncontrollably, my furry stomach started revolving, like the rolling waves on the open seas. Then I started rocking to and fro, violently like a sailboat in a storm in the roaring 40’s. Then I broke out into a drenching sweat, I could see my fur clumping together through my now salty sweat addled eyes. As ill as I felt, I could hear King Squeaky mumble over and over: “Oh no, not again, this theoretically shouldn’t even be possible…dear oh dear…somethings wrong with the plasma re-orienter settings, those bloody P.U.C.C. techs are useless…useless…USELESS!”

I thought it was over when a paw toe suddenly turned into my old human pinky finger, then it popped back to a paw toe, then a finger, then back again. Then horribly the same thing happened to my head. The whole upsetting experience lasted no longer than five minutes, then I was once again fine and fully formed. I was a healthy normal cat.

His Nibs sat me down and gave me a warm saucer of full cream milk, to settle my nerves after this harrowing trial. I said nothing and listened to his soothing words.

“Don’t worry, these teething issues occur initially, the ray gun plasma blast is 100% healthy. Your mild symptoms are merely a small technical hurdle the nerd cats at P.U.C.C. haven’t ironed out yet. This wont effect anything. For the moment just follow this process that has been rubber stamped by the highest P.U.C.C. committee, which you will be happy to know I also reside on as Chairman.

“One – avoid large gatherings or anywhere where you cannot reach a bathroom stall within 3-5 minutes. In other words no sports games or concerts, automobile trips etc.

Two – the signal to hide yourself away in a bathroom stall will occur when your tummy starts revolving, you of course must get to the bathroom stall before your head starts to flip between your normal cat’s head and your old human head. You must understand If anyone who is not a part of P.U.C.C sees a cat with a human head, the P.U.C.C. will be shut down. We cannot under any circumstances let that happen.

Three – when safely hidden from prying eyes inside the stall, you will wait the remaining minute or two till its all over, perhaps 5 to be safe, then you can rejoin the prior activity with no one the wiser”.

I was finally feeling a bit less worried when he kindly added “If you follow this process there wont be any problems, and of course you can still potentially be a member of the P.U.C.C. and I’ll make sure I’ll keep a guiding eye on you until our best P.U.C.C. Ape-to-Cat Reconfiguration Technicians resolve the problem”.

With Sir Squeaky’s increasingly calming words, I knew I was in good hands. I didn’t protest, I smiled obediently and wiggled my whiskers joyfully. Now was the time to begin psychologically preparing myself for a whole new post-human existence. After all, What else was I to do? Go back to being a human being who would be wiped out by cat instigated virus? Never! I wouldn’t dare squander the gift of life Sir Squeaky had manifestly bestowed upon me.

I reached my paw out for the well bound, red leather cover of the P.U.C.C. Manifesto. After all I had so much study to do. Sir Squeaky casually ambled over to sit on his favourite grey furry blanket, that overhung the base of the couch. He turned around twice the settled and went to sleep almost instantly. His purrs rung out loudly as I turned over the first gilded page.

THE END"
"Theme Discussion: Technological DystopiaSociety is controlled by various technological advances. This could be through robots, artificial intelligence, computers, and other various technologies. Constant citizen surveillance could be possible through different electronic devices. Online usage can both highly monitored and highly restricted. Perhaps it is only the elite that can use the internet while the citizens must earn allotted time. 

There are many elements and hypothetical situations that could fall under this category. An AI takeover is a theory in which artificial intelligence (AI) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, with computers or robots effectively taking the control of the planet away from the human species.

Imagine robot police force in suburban regions to enforce the laws of the land. Robots don't require salaries, food, drink, etc so they could be on patrol 24/7. A connection device from the vehicle recharges the robot each time the vehicle is in motion. Drones could monitor from the sky. All in the name of safety.

There may be some sort of virtual space in which people resort to this technological medium for communication, connection, and gatherings. The reduction in real-time correspondence will lead to further isolation while presenting as a convenient way to instantly connect with others. Constant surveillance is probable. On the other hand, this virtual space could also be used as a means for prison ""cells"" for harsher societies. 

In August 2007, David Nye presented the idea of cyber-dystopia, which envisions a world made worse by technological advancements. Cyber-dystopias center around the principles of the individual losing control, becoming dependent and being unable to stop change. Nye describes a society where the elite use technology to oppress and control mass groups of people. He also presents technology as a form of false hope; promising success and change, but causing pain and inconvenience when that goal is not reached. 

Some examples of this type of theme would be:

- The Matrix

- The Fifth Element

- Blade Runner

- 12 Monkeys

- The Hunger Games"
"Making my own Dystopian Universe**This is not apart of the tutorial/guide I've been making in my last few posts. Although the creative process is the same.**

**This post may contain sensitive materials. Although safe for work, and completely relative to the sub, this post contains some extremist ideologies that I do NOT associate with. This is all for a fictional work of dystopian art. Viewer discretion is advised**

&#x200B;

If you've been keeping up with my guide, you'd know that the first step to creating a functional universe or writing is the concept. I'll stay with the concept of ""a normal town with a dark secret."" This isn't really complex and while it has a bit of depth, it's still an okay concept and still can easily be expanded upon.

Let's start easy, the crucial steps to a dystopia, as I've listed in a similar comment on another post

* **Public Support** \-- You'll need the support of the public to stay in power, else you'll be overrun)
* **Civil Enforcement** \-- Even if you have Public Support, some people will see through the system, so it's nice to have a civil enforcement for your civilians to look up to as well as to weed out the ""Supposed Evil""
* **A supposed evil** \-- As a ruler, you'll want to comfort your citizens and make them despise a supposed evil that are mainly people who rebel, to instill hate against those who rebel and stability within your community. (Nazi Germany is an example of this.)
* **Civil Unrest** \-- How scared/doubtful are you citizens and how can you reassure them?
* **Cultures** \-- You will want to be able to differentiate your citizens from outsiders as well as make them feel apart of the community you've established.

These factors will all be extremely important in the making of my dystopia and when I need to, I'll get in depth of how all of these factors will be incorporated.

Now with the concept of ""a normal town with a dark secret."" we'll need to actually create the dark secret. After a few minutes of thinking, there are many possible ways I can portray this. It could be an entire dictatorship, a police state, a bio-mechanical entity insisting on creating the town as if a cycle in a machine. I mean literally anything. But in my creative process, I appeal towards things that seem normalised, despite being obviously wicked or wrong. For this purpose I want my obviously wicked plot to be a mysterious alien benefactor that guides and controls our living.

This took me a lot of time to think out and even with muses and inspiring sources, so if you're trying to follow in my footsteps this post, don't be alarmed. So to expand further upon my idea, my society would be an alien race of hive minds controlling the human beings in a small town basically indoctrinating them not by mind control but by the simple process of normalisation. By being friendly and inviting to the humans, they are able to introduce **Culture** and gain **Public Support** from their community. As you can see, 2 of the 5 elements have already been added within the introduction! But how these things will be expanded upon is an entirely different story.

**-----** **Basic Ideas of my Universe (Culture/Basic Ideas)**

What **Culture** does these aliens hive minds have? Well, since I want the town to contain a dark secret, I would have to make the alien culture, extreme and very disturbing. Since its a hive mind, I guess automation would have to be the go to on their culture. Although if the hive-mind wants to take control, they'll have to introduce their culture as a Utopian way of life for people to actually believe and love the change. What I have planned is to have the culture imitate a Utopia where currency isn't an issue. Everyone is given exquisite dinners at the same time and everyone follows the same routine with no class or hierarchy. Everyone is treated the same and acts the same with no individuality and no differences (its a hive-mind, duh). The environment will consist of the same housing, same gardening, and cities will be divided into perfect percentages of suburban, luxury goods and industrial sections to maximise efficiency of the town.

Industrial sections will consist of machines which produce the essentials and luxury goods which are perfectly tailored to help in the indoctrinating process (propaganda in the forums of toys, books etc.) controlled by basic office jobs such as accounting, coding and even the writing of the propaganda, all while using their culture to gain popularity and public support.

**----- Dystopian Details (Civil Enforcement Design/Dystopian Aspects)**

Now lets move onto a different section of the 5 elements of dystopia. Civil Enforcement and Civil Unrest. **Civil Enforcement** as well as **Public Support** and **Culture** all contribute to Civil Unrest. If Civil Enforcement doesn't do it's job well enough, it may give people fear of criminals and a feeling of being unsafe thus raising the Unrest. If the Public Support is too low, people might want to have change or have doubts about the leadership of the hive mind thus again, causing higher unrest. Finally if the culture isn't appealing or doesn't seem to appeal or unite the community, people will prefer other cultures causing a divide which obviously a hive mind won't want. But lets just say that **Public Support** and **Culture** are dealt with. We'll have to make the Civil Enforcement.

I want my civil enforcement to maintain a disturbing side and a appealing side both in physical appearance and in mentality. A nice *Civil Protector of the Law!* aesthetic while maintaining the *Killer Robot Hive Mind*. So my design or creative process of this character is a bio-mechanical entity. A robot with human features, maybe a human with gears and cogs  working with their organs and some limbs replaced with mechanics. A comedic porcelain mask (I'm sorry but Being Pretty's mask idea is just genius) to cover up the disfigured face to give the impression of a friendly yet disturbing figure. 

But you may be thinking; ***who's gonna feel safe with a siren head looking mother-fucker outside your house patroling the streets?*** Easy! Remember the element of **Culture** I mentioned above about toys and books? By using toys to make children believe that these mutated creatures believe that the civil enforcers are safe and harmless to citizens, although are able to repel the thought of the **Supposed Evil** element which if made correctly, is supposed to be hated by the community and thought of as a wrench that needs to be taken out of the cogs that is the automation cycle. The community, as they get used to the hive mind will accept these patrolers and treat them like heroes or as a cop whose saved the day.

**----- The Supposed Evil**

I'd like to reiterate for this section that this is not my real life belief, but it is the belief of the hive mind I'm trying to portray. They have these beliefs, not me personally.

The supposed evil is supposed to be an individual or group who breaks the automated cycle that the hive minds try to create. Be it a different religion, culture or just being a different individual than what they want you as.

The point I'm trying to convey is written all over my concept and how I've chosen to expand it. I want a society based on what would be considered the most efficient way to live or the best Utopia or way to live by the perspective of an alien species. There isn't much to say about who and how the **Supposed evil** is targeted, so I'll leave it at this.

Now for what happens to the supposed evil. I have 2 ideas of what I could do with the Supposed Evil of this universe, but I want to retain the element of them being taken out of the society's cogs. I have an idea to either turn them into new cogs and gears by reinventing them into the **Civil Enforcers** or by simply killing them off in execution. There are going to be multiple kinds of people that will not be up to the Hive Mind's society's standards so there will be a bunch of people in these camps. But there will be the old cogs that either aren't able to work anymore (Injured, Crippled) or have served their purpose by living the ideal life of growing up, working to provide for their family and raise their child to eventually replace them. These elderly have served their purpose and might as well be renewed as new cogs, like I stated earlier. They'll be made into the street patrolling Civil Enforcement.

**---- The End**

Thats all for now. I might make new posts updating this but thank you for reading. (I've contacted an artist and might be able to post concept art, so thats exciting!

I'd also like to remind you that I got all of this from just a simple ""a normal town with a dark secret."" prompt. With your own concepts like this, you could possibly create better or more appealing stories!

Thanks for reading!"

**I wrote this after much thought about the inter-related world of civilians, societal leaders, geopolitics, pandemics and international trade. But at it’s core, all these things are instances of social interaction. Social interaction is largely is about the contested world of forming narratives, and he who tells the best stories wins.

“Collateral damage” how could you be so cold Sir Squeeksalot? After all these years”

“3 to be Exact”, he firmly retorts. “Well as I said, dear boy, it was a tough decision, not taken lightly and we spent all night on it, and it could have gone either way at any moment.”

I was about to further protest when a firm “Knock Knock Knock” cut out our conversation.

“Special delivery for Sir Squueksalot – paw print required”

I opened the door, and Squeeky jumps up on top the box the delivery man is holding. He proudly thrusts his somewhat oversize paw to the mans digital scanner, he scans it with a “boop-bip” sound, says a robotic “thankyou”, and leaves in a flash.

Then in a blur Squeeky cuts through the carton with a deft flick of an un-retracted claw, the top box flaps open to expose a small ray gun which seems to have a handle which has been molded especially for a cats paw.

Before I know it, I see Sir Squeeky point the ray gun at my head and he says “This is harder on me than it is for you sonny”.

I am swiftly encapsulated in an otherworldly green glow of visible plasma particles. It’s like I’m looking out into distant space from the surface of Alpha Centuri.

Time seems to slow to a halt for what seems like an eternity, then in the blink of am eye, all’s normal again.

For some reason I have a monstrous craving desire for ‘RegalCatabix’, some fresh Canadian smelt all washed down with a saucer full to the brim of full cream milk ‘.

I squash the acute hunger as I see Sir Squeaksalot peering at me with that common cat look of squinted half closed eyes – though this time our eyes are equal level with each other.

As the reality begins to set in, my rising anger erupts ….I open my mouth to aggressively chastise Sir Squeeksalot and ask him to reverse whatever in hells name he’s done to me with that green plasma ray gun.

I open my mouth to let out the words, but to my surprise instead of my human voice all I hear is elongated unhappy screechy sounds:

Meoooooow ……Meeeooooowwww……..Meeeeeooooooowwwwwwww.

I am about to look around and find where the feral cat is hiding – perhaps behind the couch? Then it dawns on me.

Sir Squeaky has turned me into a cat, so as to save me from the Cat-in-the-Lab designed ‘Killer Human Virus’. The Virus that would abruptly solve all of the Earth’s man made problems.

I look sheepishly at Squeeky, he looks back in a grandfatherly-wise way and says hypnotically and with gravitas:

“It’ll take you a while to get used to your voice box and speak Cat English again, but me and the Cat’s at of the P.U.C.C will teach you everything we know”. As a tear appears in my eye he swipes my face with claws fully retracted, as says ye-olden-days speak: NOW KEEP A STIFF UPPER WHISKER AND FOR SPHINX’S SAKE CARRY ON – YOU’RE A CAT NOW”

I pawed the tears streaming from my now wide yellow cat’s eye’s. Soon my spirits began to lift as I realized how lucky I was to have Sir Squeaky save me from a certain viral death.

I no longer had to worry about the deadly ‘Man Virus’ and I could live in a paradise in a world ran by Cats running of the philosophe of “Pragmatic Utilitarianism”.

I was now an ‘insider’ cat, controlled by the strongest paws and the best minds of the P.U.CC. Soon no doubt I’d be inaugurated as a fully fledged member of P.U.C.C., and no doubt would be asked by His Nibs to jointly head the committee which will manage world affairs in lieu of those dumb humans. I mean what could possibly go wrong?

Sir Squeaky then wheeled out a platform with at least 30 large red books.

“Now we have to get you schooled up of the ideology principles and methods of the P.U.C.C. system- start with Vol 1.”

Sir Squeeks pawed off one of the books from the platform, and it landed with a thud in front of my nose. I looked at the front cover. It read as the following

“P.U.C.C. MANEFESTO Vol 1 – A NEW WORLD DIGITAL CURRENCY – THE PURRCOIN”.

Then uncontrollably, my furry stomach started revolving, like the rolling waves on the open seas. Then I started rocking to and fro, violently like a sailboat in a storm in the roaring 40’s. Then I broke out into a drenching sweat, I could see my fur clumping together through my now salty sweat addled eyes. As ill as I felt, I could hear King Squeaky mumble over and over: “Oh no, not again, this theoretically shouldn’t even be possible…dear oh dear…somethings wrong with the plasma re-orienter settings, those bloody P.U.C.C. techs are useless…useless…USELESS!”

I thought it was over when a paw toe suddenly turned into my old human pinky finger, then it popped back to a paw toe, then a finger, then back again. Then horribly the same thing happened to my head. The whole upsetting experience lasted no longer than five minutes, then I was once again fine and fully formed. I was a healthy normal cat.

His Nibs sat me down and gave me a warm saucer of full cream milk, to settle my nerves after this harrowing trial. I said nothing and listened to his soothing words.

“Don’t worry, these teething issues occur initially, the ray gun plasma blast is 100% healthy. Your mild symptoms are merely a small technical hurdle the nerd cats at P.U.C.C. haven’t ironed out yet. This wont effect anything. For the moment just follow this process that has been rubber stamped by the highest P.U.C.C. committee, which you will be happy to know I also reside on as Chairman.

“One – avoid large gatherings or anywhere where you cannot reach a bathroom stall within 3-5 minutes. In other words no sports games or concerts, automobile trips etc.

Two – the signal to hide yourself away in a bathroom stall will occur when your tummy starts revolving, you of course must get to the bathroom stall before your head starts to flip between your normal cat’s head and your old human head. You must understand If anyone who is not a part of P.U.C.C sees a cat with a human head, the P.U.C.C. will be shut down. We cannot under any circumstances let that happen.

Three – when safely hidden from prying eyes inside the stall, you will wait the remaining minute or two till its all over, perhaps 5 to be safe, then you can rejoin the prior activity with no one the wiser”.

I was finally feeling a bit less worried when he kindly added “If you follow this process there wont be any problems, and of course you can still potentially be a member of the P.U.C.C. and I’ll make sure I’ll keep a guiding eye on you until our best P.U.C.C. Ape-to-Cat Reconfiguration Technicians resolve the problem”.

With Sir Squeaky’s increasingly calming words, I knew I was in good hands. I didn’t protest, I smiled obediently and wiggled my whiskers joyfully. Now was the time to begin psychologically preparing myself for a whole new post-human existence. After all, What else was I to do? Go back to being a human being who would be wiped out by cat instigated virus? Never! I wouldn’t dare squander the gift of life Sir Squeaky had manifestly bestowed upon me.

I reached my paw out for the well bound, red leather cover of the P.U.C.C. Manifesto. After all I had so much study to do. Sir Squeaky casually ambled over to sit on his favourite grey furry blanket, that overhung the base of the couch. He turned around twice the settled and went to sleep almost instantly. His purrs rung out loudly as I turned over the first gilded page.

THE END"
"How to write/make a dystopian universe (PART 2)Hello all! This is the second part to my previous post on how to create a dystopian universe. In my last post, I covered how to write a concept for a dystopian universe. Now to the hardest part. Actually writing the start is the hardest part in my opinion. But it is the most important part of a story. I guess we should start with characters.

My favourite author, Malorie Blackman - Author of [Noughts and Crosses](https://www.bookscool.com/en/Noughts-Crosses-255504/1) described her creative process of writing her characters it to write a biography of them. What do they like? What are their personalities? Their backgrounds etc. For the sake of this guide, I'll be making a character myself and while doing so, help guide you to making better, more developed characters for your story.

REMEMBER: Your characters should be exactly like your concept, simple and easy to expand upon (Low complexity, High depth).

My concept for this guide will be ""The last person in an abandoned earth"" as you can see, it is not complex at all and has room to be expanded upon, why did is abandoned etc. This is exactly how your characters should be in their introduction.

Lets start with Malorie Blackman's character from her book ""[Noble Conflict](https://www.bookscool.com/en/Noble-Conflict-676384/1)"" named Kasper. his background is simple and easy to understand within her writing; ""A farm boy who wants to become a guardian"" which is then expanded as the story progresses. For my concept, my characters story is going to be; ""A girl who tries to understand her past"". This is very simple and contains multiple ways for me to expand such as:

>She cruised the aisles, fascinated by the intercom's pre-recorded radio message. Probably decades old.

&#x200B;

>Ashley sat on the tiled roof, loading a podcast onto her phone while looking into the distance at the abandoned cars that sat upon the highway.

Or even something as simple as:

>Ashley cruised the echoing halls of the library, exploring the rows after rows of disorganized history books.

But enough of that. Lets start with introductions and actually writing the universe! *Whoowee, this is exciting!* My concept perceives the fact that the earth has been abandoned, either by space travel or maybe an anomalous reason. Either way, there will be disrepair, collapsed buildings and dysfunctional items. But I want a sizzling start, so what can I add which can help my sentence? Action? Adventure? Homicidal, Heat Seaking, 50. Cal Machine gun holding robots with optional 8 pylon rocket launchers? Nope! None of these, but mystery!

>The empty Woolworths loomed with eeriness as Ashley cruised the aisles. Listening to the broadcast of 2000's musics over the stores rickety and worn down intercom. She searched aisle after aisle for food items, hopefully some which hasn't expired yet. *Aisle 7, Aisle 8... Aisle 8...* The skeleton laying on the floor stared holes into Ashley. It was heavily decomposed and rotting although this was nothing new. Just a regular store filled with shelves in disarray, products scattered over floors and water and melted substances spilled over floors.

Did this get your attention? It should. If it didn't then curse my writing ability ;c. What you read was actually based off a small extract of a story I wrote for a junior writing competition back in grade 8 (Obviously redone). As you can see, I explained the scene without explanation. allowing the low complexity and high depth aspect. Removing the explanation helps the reader imagine the scene better and get the cogs in their head turning, asking the question *""What happened?"" ""Why is there a skeleton?""*

But in this introduction, I've missed one crucial detail. The character! I haven't properly introduced her yet. Lets do that, We'll use the first paragraph and add this on:

>Ashley skipped the aisle -- it was best to forget these things. She went into the 9th aisle, grabbing some canned food items with a wide grin. These, although rare, were the best food in the dystopia that is earth. She hid the items in her large bulky brown backpack. She picked up the backpack and left the store just as quickly as she entered. It was only a few blocks away but there above debris of smashed and wrecked buildings sat her hideout. A somehow standing attic with a wide view of a city which left her pondering many nights about her past.

What I hope to convey in this paragraph is to give the impression that she's been surviving for a while and was used to the bad aspects of the dystopian world I've created.

This is all I'm going to put in this guide but I hope this helps you in character creation and how to portray them. I'll be doing a part 3 later hopefully to expand on this but for the meantime, put questions in the comments and I'll happily answer them!"
