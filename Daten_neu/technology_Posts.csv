World's Top Artificial Intelligence Developers Sign Open Letter Calling for AI Safety Research
"How Samsung should dispose of millions of hazardous Note 7 handsets.This is, without a doubt, the first time in the history of consumer electronics that a single product has been recalled so soon after it's release, while at the same time becoming a illegal to take onto an aircraft.

What's more, it's also the shortest lifespan of a flagship smartphone for any company, with the Note 7 lasting only 58 days from it's launch on the 19th August, to being discontinued on the 11th October 2016.

However, to their merit, Samsung have been über responsible with their rapid recall process and granting full refunds and additional $25 and $100 gift vouchers to customers; the higher value vouchers only granted to those who opt for an alternative Samsung handset, rather than a full refund.

Now that Samsung have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of these pocket-sized incendiary devices awaiting disposal, there are a lot of questions which I believe *need* to be asked before the public can breathe easy again, knowing that there will be no more vehicle fires, personal injuries or worse, owing to this device.

The disposal of these devices needs to be carried out with military precision, ensuring that every single device is not only safely destroyed on paper, but physically destroyed to guarantee that the Note 7 will cause no more damage.

Each and *every* returned handset needs to be treated as if it would cost Samsung $1million if it somehow escaped the destruction process - because depending on what damage it could cause, it might well cost them $1million!

This may sound straightforward. After all, there are thousands of responsible E-Waste recyclers all over the world, each promising guaranteed destruction of data and assets.

What makes all of these trustworthy companies, with various accreditations, unsuitable to dispose of the Note 7 en masse?

The first problem will be transporting the devices to the point of destruction. They cannot be carried by air freight. Numerous parcel delivery companies refuse to handle them, and if you were to transport each phone individually in it's own contained sarcophagus, you then have to take into account that a few may go 'missing' in the delivery chain. 
For regular customers, an insurance payout usually takes care of that.
But in this case, the whole point of this program is to 'exterminate' these handsets to avoid further damages to people, property and of course Samsung.

So let's assume that Samsung have conquered the logistics issue somehow.

Where do we send over a million smartphones, each with a potentially deadly battery fault?

E-waste recyclers the Far East would quite happily take care of these handsets. The costs would be relatively low because of the corruption and absence of any serious environmental laws, but this defeats the entire program - you might as well hand them out to kids on Halloween night.

A Chinese e-waste recycler will be handed a million like-new smartphones, each with a retail price of around $900. The *last* thing they will do is feed each and every one of them into the shredder (Even though you wouldn't want to shred them, but we'll come to that).

No doubt a few tens of thousands of them will end up in the Shenzhen market, maybe after a local factory has removed all of the Samsung branding from them for $5 each. 

The resale price in Shenzen? 
$200? $100? Who cares? 

A brand new *unbranded* smartphone with ultra high specification for less than 1/3rd of the cost to have it manufactured? They will sell out within a week. Meanwhile, Samsung are none the wiser and as far as they are concerned, the Note 7s have all been destroyed.

Before you know it, you have simply shifted the problem to China, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Incendiary device is making headlines once again after burning down apartment blocks and cars in China, killing hundreds and injuring thousands. 

Yes, Samsung can wave their arms and show the media the documents which *prove* they had the phones destroyed - but the public's trust in Samsung will sink even lower than it already is.

So you instead opt for an e-waste recycler in Europe or the US - or at least within a country which has little corruption and high environmental standards for recyclers to adhere to.

You then have to ensure that these phones are disposed of in the *correct* way, removing any possibility for parts to be resold or reused, either inside or outside of the disposal chain.

The traditional way to dispose of products is by shredding or granulation. This involves a high-torque set of rotating blades with a feed hopper above them. This method is used extensively throughout the waste industry for everything, from tyres and clothing to banknotes, coinage and e-waste such as laptops, photocopiers and hard drives.

In order to use this method of product destruction, it has a simple requirement - batteries must be removed from the product before they can be shredded. 
This is to prevent explosions and fires from occurring. 

Unfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7 is a sealed unit. This means it's wasn't *designed* to be taken apart. Even if you could, this would be extremely time-consuming, expensive and possibly dangerous - not to mention that it would mean storing these ticking time bombs for an excessive length of time while a small army of factory-floor workers painstakingly remove each and every battery from over a million devices before the less hazardous remains can be shredded.

So, shredding is out of the question - at least unless you want to employ a few hundred staff in haz-mat suits to remove the batteries one by one.

The best option in my opinion is to create a custom disassembly line, whereby the handsets can be robotically placed into a custom built jig. 
You then have an optically guided blade - almost like a cookie cutter - to cut around the entire battery within the phone. This would leave each handset looking like it had a bite taken out of it, but this would be beneficial as this would render most of the components also unusable, while isolating the battery from the rest of the components.

This would minimize the human intervention in the disassembly process, making it safer overall in many ways. Mostly because if any battery did inadvertently explode during the process, the problem can be contained and dealt with quickly with only cosmetic damage to a robot arm, rather than first or second-degree burns to a member of staff. Secondly, by reducing human intervention, you increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of the destruction process.

The Li-Po batteries can then be safely disposed of immediately within the same facility to reduce the length of time between when they are removed and when they are disposed to almost nothing.

After the battery is safely taken care of, the mutilated remains of the devices can then be safely granulated for the recovery of precious metals.

Additionally, because of the huge numbers of these phones which need to be safely destroyed, this is the second most cost effective, and *the* most environmentally friendly method of disposal. This may offer some 

The second option for disposal is less high-tech, less environmentally friendly, but a lot more Mafia-style.

Samsung could simply buy thousands of 55-gallon steel drums, add a good quality concrete mix before mixing in a few hundred Note 7's to each drum, then weld the drum closed and entomb the phones forever. 

This would serve a number of purposes. The most important reason would be fire prevention. Even if a phone *did* self-ignite, there's not much damage it can do when it's surrounded by concrete.
Secondly, it would prevent anybody from stealing them for parts or reselling the entire handsets at all.

The drums can then be buried in a desert somewhere, just as Atari did 30 years ago with the infamous E.T. game they released on the 2600 - although Atari forgot to use steel drums and instead simply covered the games in concrete after dumping them in a New Mexico landfill site.

You could store the drums in an underground repository such as Onkalo in Finland, but this is strictly for nuclear waste. Also, including exploding smartphones on their warning signs which are designed to warn generations 100,000 years from now may not be easy to portray.

This is the least environmentally friendly method. 
The Gold, Silver, Copper and other precious metals cannot be recycled, and any hazardous materials - such as the Lithium in the battery - are left to possibly leak into the environment in the future if the drums are not stored correctly.

Overall, I think that Samsung need to set up their own in-house disposal facility for these phones, rather than outsourcing this essential task to a third party company. This will also reduce the possibility of corruption, and ensure that phones earmarked for destruction *are* physically destroyed.

I hope that when the time comes, Samsung are as open about their disposal process as they have been with their recall process. That is how they will win back the trust of their customers."
"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"How Samsung should dispose of millions of hazardous Note 7 handsets.This is, without a doubt, the first time in the history of consumer electronics that a single product has been recalled so soon after it's release, while at the same time becoming a illegal to take onto an aircraft.

What's more, it's also the shortest lifespan of a flagship smartphone for any company, with the Note 7 lasting only 58 days from it's launch on the 19th August, to being discontinued on the 11th October 2016.

However, to their merit, Samsung have been über responsible with their rapid recall process and granting full refunds and additional $25 and $100 gift vouchers to customers; the higher value vouchers only granted to those who opt for an alternative Samsung handset, rather than a full refund.

Now that Samsung have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of these pocket-sized incendiary devices awaiting disposal, there are a lot of questions which I believe *need* to be asked before the public can breathe easy again, knowing that there will be no more vehicle fires, personal injuries or worse, owing to this device.

The disposal of these devices needs to be carried out with military precision, ensuring that every single device is not only safely destroyed on paper, but physically destroyed to guarantee that the Note 7 will cause no more damage.

Each and *every* returned handset needs to be treated as if it would cost Samsung $1million if it somehow escaped the destruction process - because depending on what damage it could cause, it might well cost them $1million!

This may sound straightforward. After all, there are thousands of responsible E-Waste recyclers all over the world, each promising guaranteed destruction of data and assets.

What makes all of these trustworthy companies, with various accreditations, unsuitable to dispose of the Note 7 en masse?

The first problem will be transporting the devices to the point of destruction. They cannot be carried by air freight. Numerous parcel delivery companies refuse to handle them, and if you were to transport each phone individually in it's own contained sarcophagus, you then have to take into account that a few may go 'missing' in the delivery chain. 
For regular customers, an insurance payout usually takes care of that.
But in this case, the whole point of this program is to 'exterminate' these handsets to avoid further damages to people, property and of course Samsung.

So let's assume that Samsung have conquered the logistics issue somehow.

Where do we send over a million smartphones, each with a potentially deadly battery fault?

E-waste recyclers the Far East would quite happily take care of these handsets. The costs would be relatively low because of the corruption and absence of any serious environmental laws, but this defeats the entire program - you might as well hand them out to kids on Halloween night.

A Chinese e-waste recycler will be handed a million like-new smartphones, each with a retail price of around $900. The *last* thing they will do is feed each and every one of them into the shredder (Even though you wouldn't want to shred them, but we'll come to that).

No doubt a few tens of thousands of them will end up in the Shenzhen market, maybe after a local factory has removed all of the Samsung branding from them for $5 each. 

The resale price in Shenzen? 
$200? $100? Who cares? 

A brand new *unbranded* smartphone with ultra high specification for less than 1/3rd of the cost to have it manufactured? They will sell out within a week. Meanwhile, Samsung are none the wiser and as far as they are concerned, the Note 7s have all been destroyed.

Before you know it, you have simply shifted the problem to China, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Incendiary device is making headlines once again after burning down apartment blocks and cars in China, killing hundreds and injuring thousands. 

Yes, Samsung can wave their arms and show the media the documents which *prove* they had the phones destroyed - but the public's trust in Samsung will sink even lower than it already is.

So you instead opt for an e-waste recycler in Europe or the US - or at least within a country which has little corruption and high environmental standards for recyclers to adhere to.

You then have to ensure that these phones are disposed of in the *correct* way, removing any possibility for parts to be resold or reused, either inside or outside of the disposal chain.

The traditional way to dispose of products is by shredding or granulation. This involves a high-torque set of rotating blades with a feed hopper above them. This method is used extensively throughout the waste industry for everything, from tyres and clothing to banknotes, coinage and e-waste such as laptops, photocopiers and hard drives.

In order to use this method of product destruction, it has a simple requirement - batteries must be removed from the product before they can be shredded. 
This is to prevent explosions and fires from occurring. 

Unfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7 is a sealed unit. This means it's wasn't *designed* to be taken apart. Even if you could, this would be extremely time-consuming, expensive and possibly dangerous - not to mention that it would mean storing these ticking time bombs for an excessive length of time while a small army of factory-floor workers painstakingly remove each and every battery from over a million devices before the less hazardous remains can be shredded.

So, shredding is out of the question - at least unless you want to employ a few hundred staff in haz-mat suits to remove the batteries one by one.

The best option in my opinion is to create a custom disassembly line, whereby the handsets can be robotically placed into a custom built jig. 
You then have an optically guided blade - almost like a cookie cutter - to cut around the entire battery within the phone. This would leave each handset looking like it had a bite taken out of it, but this would be beneficial as this would render most of the components also unusable, while isolating the battery from the rest of the components.

This would minimize the human intervention in the disassembly process, making it safer overall in many ways. Mostly because if any battery did inadvertently explode during the process, the problem can be contained and dealt with quickly with only cosmetic damage to a robot arm, rather than first or second-degree burns to a member of staff. Secondly, by reducing human intervention, you increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of the destruction process.

The Li-Po batteries can then be safely disposed of immediately within the same facility to reduce the length of time between when they are removed and when they are disposed to almost nothing.

After the battery is safely taken care of, the mutilated remains of the devices can then be safely granulated for the recovery of precious metals.

Additionally, because of the huge numbers of these phones which need to be safely destroyed, this is the second most cost effective, and *the* most environmentally friendly method of disposal. This may offer some 

The second option for disposal is less high-tech, less environmentally friendly, but a lot more Mafia-style.

Samsung could simply buy thousands of 55-gallon steel drums, add a good quality concrete mix before mixing in a few hundred Note 7's to each drum, then weld the drum closed and entomb the phones forever. 

This would serve a number of purposes. The most important reason would be fire prevention. Even if a phone *did* self-ignite, there's not much damage it can do when it's surrounded by concrete.
Secondly, it would prevent anybody from stealing them for parts or reselling the entire handsets at all.

The drums can then be buried in a desert somewhere, just as Atari did 30 years ago with the infamous E.T. game they released on the 2600 - although Atari forgot to use steel drums and instead simply covered the games in concrete after dumping them in a New Mexico landfill site.

You could store the drums in an underground repository such as Onkalo in Finland, but this is strictly for nuclear waste. Also, including exploding smartphones on their warning signs which are designed to warn generations 100,000 years from now may not be easy to portray.

This is the least environmentally friendly method. 
The Gold, Silver, Copper and other precious metals cannot be recycled, and any hazardous materials - such as the Lithium in the battery - are left to possibly leak into the environment in the future if the drums are not stored correctly.

Overall, I think that Samsung need to set up their own in-house disposal facility for these phones, rather than outsourcing this essential task to a third party company. This will also reduce the possibility of corruption, and ensure that phones earmarked for destruction *are* physically destroyed.

I hope that when the time comes, Samsung are as open about their disposal process as they have been with their recall process. That is how they will win back the trust of their customers."
"Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC]If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

"Singularity Summit Melbourne Australia 20-21 August 2011 - last day for early bird ticketsThe Singularity Summit is Coming to Town (20-21 August 2011)!

The Singularity Summit is an annual conference focused on the Singularity and related converging technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

On present trends, computers will have more powerful ""brains"" than humans by around 2030. It's likely that this, and corresponding developments in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology and medicine will fundamentally change the world we live in. This will affect every one of us in profound ways that are only dimly understood. 

The Singularity represents an ""event horizon"" in the predictability of human technological development. We have no means to predict the behaviour of entities smarter and more capable than ourselves so our models of the future cease to give reliable answers. While some regard the Singularity as a positive event and work to hasten its arrival, others have misgivings. We debate and discuss the most practical means for initiating the Singularity, and how, or whether, it can be influenced or managed. The Singularity Summits lead the world's dialogue on the Singularity, bringing together scientists, technologists, sceptics, and enthusiasts alike.

The summit will explore the important human and philosophical dimensions of the Singularity. Presentations will explore how can we plan rationally for Transhumanism, how can we ensure that the beneficial potential of the Singularity is realised, and how do we manage the risks involved. David Chalmers and others will examine how the Singularity will stretch our understanding of what it is to be human, to be conscious, and how our moral intuitions can extend to a world of non-human and partly-human intelligences.

It is hypothesized that Machines will out think by Computers before the middle of this century.

Professor Hugo de Garis says in History Channel's documentary Prophets of Doom ""It is only a question of time now before humanity can build artificial brains that are far more intelligent than human beings. So this is a huge issue that will eclipse any other human issue this century...I call this 'Species dominance'.""

Although this sounds like science fiction, its starting to take this very seriously.  This year the Singularity has made the cover of Time Magazine, and the topic of a feature documentary 'Transcendent Man' has been .  You have people like Larry Page (CEO of Google) taking an interest in this stuff, prominent public figures willing to associate their names with the Singularity, its definitely a move from the fringes, if not yet into the mainstream, then a lot closer..

""If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now a lot happens in 6 months."" says Ray Kurzweil in documentary Transcendent Man.  ""Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster, it's going to continue, and in about 40 years it is going to become so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless, you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we have created.""

This conference will challenge and enhance your view of the future.

Although this sounds like science fiction, its starting to take this very seriously.  This year the Singularity has made the cover of Time Magazine, and the topic of a feature documentary 'Transcendent Man' has been .  You have people like Larry Page (CEO of Google) taking an interest in this stuff, prominent public figures willing to associate their names with the Singularity, its definitely a move from the fringes, if not yet into the mainstream, then a lot closer..

""If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now a lot happens in 6 months."" says Ray Kurzweil in documentary Transcendent Man.  ""Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster, it's going to continue, and in about 40 years it is going to become so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless, you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we have created.""

This conference will challenge and enhance your view of the future.

"A foldable drone that can rescue survivors from collapsed buildings**Abstract**

The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this work, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute.  No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.

"Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC]If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

# Why preventing deforestation is more important:

From the latest [Global Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) it seems to be clear that it would be more effective to stop deforestation than to allow it to happen and subsequently reforest.

For example, [as the European Commission writes](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-08-632_en.htm):

>In terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to cut down trees and reforest subsequently, as deforestation leads to some irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

[On Wikipedia it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#Criticisms):

>There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.

and according to [this recent study and its report](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1474-y) the probability that legacy carbon (organic carbon that has escaped earlier fires and has accumulated at the surface of boreal-forest soils) will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest.

Furthermore it can be harder to rebuild a forest than to prevent its destruction. This is also because a healthy forest requires biodiversity and other things. For example some trees used in some reforesting efforts can prevent the growth of other plants and can prevent growth of diverse vegetation. This in turn can for example also lead to more destructive wildfires in (re)forested areas. [Jonah Busch states](https://earthinnovation.org/2019/05/reforestation-can-help-reverse-the-climate-and-extinction-crises/) that:

>Avoided deforestation offers ten times as much abatement as reforestation at $20 per ton

while:

>reforestation is more cost-effective than avoiding deforestation in some places

Moreover, [according to a 2019 study global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests are being underestimated by a factor of six](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/31/climate-emissions-from-tropical-forest-damage-underestimated-by-a-factor-of-six).

And of course [the effects of af- or reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-keeping-mature-forests-intact-is-key-to-the-climate-fight).

The main issue with reforestation as a solution is that:

>Perhaps the biggest difficulty with reforestation as a strategy is simply that it takes so much time to reap the benefits for global warming. If you plant a seedling today, it will take several decades to get the same carbon sequestration benefits we get from mature trees in tropical forests. So, in the short and medium term, reforestation cannot offer nearly as much benefit as limiting deforestation in the first place.

[as Doug Boucher, UCS Director of Climate Research and Analysis has put it](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/would-reforestation-help-counter-deforestation).

[Here](https://theconversation.com/want-to-beat-climate-change-protect-our-natural-forests-121491) ""the protection and recovery of carbon-rich and long-lived ecosystems, especially natural forests"" is called ""**the major climate solution**"".

>Natural forest systems, with their rich and complex biodiversity, the product of ecological and evolutionary processes, are stable, resilient, far better at adapting to changing conditions and store more carbon than young, degraded or plantation forests. \[...\] proforestation is a more effective, immediate and low-cost method for removing and storing atmospheric carbon in the long-term than tree planting \[...\] Instead of planting entirely new areas, we should prioritise reconnecting forested areas and restoring the edges of forest, to protect their mature core. This means our carbon-storing forests will be more resilient and longer-lasting.

* [There are also **other carbon sinks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) \- including ""ocean afforestation"" - but most aren't as straight-forward and effective as (protection of) forests.
* Forests for climate change mitigation is also about the soil. **Soil health** is another important factor in climate change mitigation and strained by current agriculture (pesticides etc). Healthy soils are also important for sustained food production (especially since population is expected to grow).
* **Peatlands** are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store and ""[although peatlands make up only 3 percent of the Earth's surface, they store one third of the soil carbon trapped in soils globally. Preserving peatlands is therefore of paramount importance for mitigating climate change](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-peatlands-carbon-dioxide-droughts.html)""
* **It needs both reforestation and protection** of forests. [Reforestation is important too](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2017/10/11/1710465114.full.pdf) and is ""[among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76)"" (however [that latter study could have estimated the potential 5 times too large](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay7976)). And theoretically many [young forests can sequester CO2 faster than old forests](https://psmag.com/environment/young-trees-suck-up-more-carbon-than-old-ones). Reforestation projects can also educate and sensitize people to this issue and thereby prevent deforestation.
* I'm **not affiliated** with any of the projects. If this isn't immediately buried I'll keep working on it independently simply because I consider it (effective climate change mitigation within the timeframe of \~10 years) important. The list is incomplete, not only because it puts a focus on technical solutions:
* **If you know of any other project** (or information) that's relevant but not yet included in the list please post a comment and I'll edit the post to add it if it features some some innovative mechanism or technology (i.e. I won't add more projects that have people plant trees by hand except if they e.g. have a new way to coordinate their planting). I'm interested in which projects you think could be most effective and what you think the most difficult root-problems they are facing are."
"I think we should oppose artificial consciousness. What do you think?  

Artificial consciousness is basically the field about machines that can feel something (be conscious/aware). 

It seems terribly frightening to me the posibility of creating this kind of consciousness.

The huge problem is the possibility that this consciouss beings are able to suffer. Because I dont think “they” will suffer in the same way humans or animals do:

\- Living beings seem able to take decisions that allow them to avoid or minimize their suffering. Machines could be programmed or made to only suffer.

\- Living beings usually have “short” lifespans so they can suffer during lifes that usually last less than a century (or a month in cases like insects). Machines while they are powered could suffer during MILLIONS, BILLIONS etc. of years.

\- Living beings usually show signs when they are suffering that can make them being helped (or killed to avoid that suffering). We can not see easily what is going inside a machine.

\- With the elevated power of those machines, those consciousness could experience more time than what we experience as humans in the same interval (ex: 1 day for every human second)

You may argue that these types of suffering could never be as horrible as the suffering humans and animals feel. It stills being unfair and maybe we could be able to simulate human consciousness soon.

What you have read could seem too pesimistic. But some humans can be very evil/twisted/sadistic and capable of creating those horrible torture devices. Also there is the posibility of conscious machines that are made to feel good but they have an error or are hacked or modified and end suffering too.

This possibility makes me feel sick and I think we should oppose this kind of unethical advancements. Because they could become some type of HELL for some consciousness (also called souls).

Excuse my english."
"How do you feel about hardware being made obsolete and disposed of because the new product has more features which turn out to be only software.I have noticed that with increasing regularity, technology being made obsolete or being superseded by the ""next generation"" for marketing reasons only, the next generation only has some token hardware changes which don't really matter but a plethora of software changes that fundamentally make the device better  
Case in point, the iphone 4 did not have siri, the iphone 4s did, apple claimed the iphone 4 was not capable of running siri, and yet myself and thousands of others (with jailbroken phones) used siri for years without issue.  
**Algorithms and software features are the defining make or break factor of most products on sale today**  \- More and more, the hardware in devices (be it phones , tablets, stand alone cameras, robot vacuum cleaners, drones etc) is identical (processors and other hardware alike) or marginally different in the next generation of device where the ""big features"" being touted turn out to just be improved algorithms for image processing, flight planning, cleaning paths, beauty modes or new features, something the old hardware would not only benefit from, but could more than easily support.  


Now this has gone on for many years, however with hardware changes in new products starting to plateau as we hit the limits of our current miniaturization technology, this is beginning to happen everywhere I look in all hardware i use from tv's, to cars, to smart watches, to phones, to benders etc.  


This has discussion has been stemmed from a product i own (a roborock s50 robot vacuum cleaner), the company announced its successor and touted a bunch of new features, the primary of which is improved algorithms for cleaning paths, I am just sitting here thinking.... and why aren't these improved algorithms on my hardware because the difference between the s6 and s50 is practically nothing, and I am tired of my old tech being disposed of or otherwise wasted because the manufacturer decided to make it obsolete rather than because it is genuinely incapable."
"Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC]If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before— somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it.

"The end to manned, aerial-destruction operations as we know it.Key Points:
-Navy's bat-winged robotic X-47B drone makes first flight from Edwards Airforce Base, California
-Built under Navy funded $635.8 million contract awarded to Los Angeles-based Northrop Grumman Corp in 2007
-Drone designed to fly at 40,000 feet with speeds of more than 500 miles per hour.

Drone's designed fundamental mission-
""The X-47B is being developed to take off from an aircraft carrier, drop a bomb on an enemy target and then land back on a carrier, all without a pilot.""

My question is to anyone; What is the advantage in giving $635 million dollars to a drone project that DOES NOT save one life. How does an unmanned jet capable of flying 40,000 feet in the air and dropping a bomb really benefit the actual combat and killings taking place on the battlefield?
I'm no expert on military operations, but it seems to me that unmanned ground vehicles, and tools capable of defending those taking on actual gunfire are the most useful. 

The only sense I see in the project comes for the last line in the article,
      
 ""This demonstration program is intended to reduce risk for potential future unmanned systems operating in and around aircraft carriers.""

That being said, I am still not buying the idea in awarding $650 million  to something that any pilot can do on half a night's sleep. 

My point is this; the best military drones are those in which support our boys on the ground. I hate to see $650 million go to virtually nothing. I mean I guess its cool that we now have a way to bring the hammer down on anyone, anytime, from the comfort of our carrier. I just don't see the demand for this airplane.

"Singularity Summit Melbourne Australia 20-21 August 2011 - last day for early bird ticketsThe Singularity Summit is Coming to Town (20-21 August 2011)!

The Singularity Summit is an annual conference focused on the Singularity and related converging technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

On present trends, computers will have more powerful ""brains"" than humans by around 2030. It's likely that this, and corresponding developments in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology and medicine will fundamentally change the world we live in. This will affect every one of us in profound ways that are only dimly understood. 

The Singularity represents an ""event horizon"" in the predictability of human technological development. We have no means to predict the behaviour of entities smarter and more capable than ourselves so our models of the future cease to give reliable answers. While some regard the Singularity as a positive event and work to hasten its arrival, others have misgivings. We debate and discuss the most practical means for initiating the Singularity, and how, or whether, it can be influenced or managed. The Singularity Summits lead the world's dialogue on the Singularity, bringing together scientists, technologists, sceptics, and enthusiasts alike.

The summit will explore the important human and philosophical dimensions of the Singularity. Presentations will explore how can we plan rationally for Transhumanism, how can we ensure that the beneficial potential of the Singularity is realised, and how do we manage the risks involved. David Chalmers and others will examine how the Singularity will stretch our understanding of what it is to be human, to be conscious, and how our moral intuitions can extend to a world of non-human and partly-human intelligences.

It is hypothesized that Machines will out think by Computers before the middle of this century.

Professor Hugo de Garis says in History Channel's documentary Prophets of Doom ""It is only a question of time now before humanity can build artificial brains that are far more intelligent than human beings. So this is a huge issue that will eclipse any other human issue this century...I call this 'Species dominance'.""

Although this sounds like science fiction, its starting to take this very seriously.  This year the Singularity has made the cover of Time Magazine, and the topic of a feature documentary 'Transcendent Man' has been .  You have people like Larry Page (CEO of Google) taking an interest in this stuff, prominent public figures willing to associate their names with the Singularity, its definitely a move from the fringes, if not yet into the mainstream, then a lot closer..

""If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now a lot happens in 6 months."" says Ray Kurzweil in documentary Transcendent Man.  ""Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster, it's going to continue, and in about 40 years it is going to become so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless, you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we have created.""

This conference will challenge and enhance your view of the future.

"Technological Change and Mental Health: How will the workforce of the future cope with the 4th industrial revolution?This article was published on [KevinMD](https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/06/technological-change-and-mental-health-how-will-the-workforce-of-the-future-cope-with-the-fourth-industrial-revolution.html) and [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/202006/technological-change-and-mental-health).

Work is a necessary part of life. More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose.

While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological “revolutions.” Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general.

This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts — particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-migrant-workers-miserable/589423/) or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems.

Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab)) now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on.

While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the “job” by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority.

**The Rise of the Precariat**

All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.

This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moore’s Law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweil’s Law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.

This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years — in regions like the Rust Belt, for example — and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words “precarious” and “proletariat”) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.

If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.

While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy “bot” can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people?

This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do?

**The Impact on Mental Health**

While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health.

Many of them have already materialized.

I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults.

As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone — even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349722/).

Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial “giving 110%” here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership.

Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](https://www.ft.com/content/e61ca2e2-18f0-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996) should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) physical and mental health problems associated with “[worklessness](https://thischangedmypractice.com/the-risks-of-worklessness/)” (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression).

**The Role of Mental Health Professionals**

Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life.

For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients’ conditions if we are to properly treat them."
the matrix is happening one step at a time [vid]
"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"Tell the truth in a way Macy can understandIt is a given, this world is growing into a big ball of chaos. It is shrinking in virtual size, becoming more open, and easily accessible. A lot can be accomplished with a click of a button, from important decisions being made to colossal amounts of money being transferred to countries that are miles away. We live and breath in a world that is so fragile – where one wrong move can send hackers a million opportunities for them to use their scary skills in the manner that makes us grind our teeth – within a split second. This kind of world – one that is speeding on the highway to robotic glory – requires a special kind of attention when it comes to security.

Security can mean different things to different people. For some, its knowing that their home is protected from thieves running about the streets, and for others, its the same assurance guaranteeing their personal data is protected from cyber burglars, that are hungry to feast on fresh confidential knowledge.

The fact of the matter is, we live in an animal kingdom (and we always have been!) – we just keep forgetting. Somewhere along the journey of evolution, people introduced a rigid system of law and order; a system that claims to protect life and property from those that are envious, or feel inferior. But what our founders failed to acknowledge is that introducing a judicial system does not automatically stop crime.

As technology lays down the rules for the 21st century, global relations and habits become more intertwined and complex than a spider’s web. The complexity of computer science has gained so much power over the ordinary mind, that it is slowly becoming difficult for tech-average folk to keep up, or even remotely, understand the consequences of having personal information on the line.

It is paramount for people to realise that the world of technology is literally like a world. Despite having knowledge on longitude, latitude and land mass, there is always something new to discover, that may change or influence the existence of things. Therefore, putting your personal data out there is your responsibility, no one else’s. And yes, there are security geniuses that help you shield this personal data, but ultimately shielding comes from within your mind.

To all those clever tech gurus out there: bring justice to the term ‘guru’. Things need to be taken it down a few notches. People need to know what it really means to be “online”. They need to be truly tech-aware in this fathomless age. The wrinkles in the spread of knowledge need to be ironed out.

Tell the truth in a way Macy can understand."

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix.

"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement.

The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before— somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

"Another BBC piece on why we should fear technology (really?) + link to BBC articleThe BBC came out with yet another piece discussing how should we fear technology. The usual examples were used, such as HAL - a murderous PC that decides to take out the astronauts on board a spacecraft. In other words, it was a machine bent on destruction... very much like the Terminator cyborgs that roam the earth hunting humans.

On this article there were even statements from Elon Musk describing artificial intelligence (AI) as ""our biggest existential threat"".  They also use Prof. Hawkins' statements discussing we ""could not compete"" with something more intelligent than we are; however he did say ""AI will be a positive force"".

Perhaps our problem is a god complex where we want to manipulate and micromanage every aspect of evolution, but that is just not possible. We are surrounded by other living beings that exist, evolve and move on with their lives despite our presence. We are even confronted with microorganisms that challenge us, invade our bodies and eventually kills us; and despite all of our technology, we have not been able to conquer cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's ... or even the common cold. 

We cannot control microorganisms, but we have a good shot at directing and controlling technology, so it should be seen as a tool or as an instrument - not much different from the first stick our ancestors used to pick on bones. Our sticks are more advanced, but they are just sticks.

I had the pleasure to work with artificial neural networks (ANN) in my career in a high tech company and they were very fun algorithms to work with... lots of discoveries took place because of this parallel thinking technology is available. For example here in the US our credit scores are calculated by an algorithm: there is not one person tallying up the numbers! We also use advanced software to look for the lowest prices on our trips, and so on. There are many positive uses of AI, ANN and technology in general.  The article even described Prof. Hawkin's new voice generating device - and that is certainly a significant accomplishment for technology. 

There is fear computers or robots will displace workers - but that is already a reality... in fact it has been taking place since the industrial revolution: when the Brits came up with uses for the steam engine and the first automated textile mills appeared there were significant changes in England...but they coped and learned to adapt. So perhaps what we lack is willingness to be more flexible?

Look at the ""rust belt"" in the Mid-West... it is just a name... there are no more rolls of back to back metal shops waiting to hire machinists. Instead we have Silicon Valley with its high tech workers, and some promising technologies:  renewable energy and drones. Of course Boeing is still around making complex machinery work for us.

Another good example is Halloween: when kids are exposed to monsters, ghosts and witches their fear factor actually goes down. Perhaps we need to do the same with technology: expose more people to it and bring about more transparency in the use of technology and have more debate in our society.

I hope software and hardware will continue to evolve - hopefully at a brisk pace - so that those tools can help us conquer the challenges we have so far not been able to defeat and thus help us achieve greatness. The future need not be dark at all.

# Why preventing deforestation is more important:

From the latest [Global Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) it seems to be clear that it would be more effective to stop deforestation than to allow it to happen and subsequently reforest.

For example, [as the European Commission writes](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-08-632_en.htm):

>In terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to cut down trees and reforest subsequently, as deforestation leads to some irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

[On Wikipedia it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#Criticisms):

>There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.

and according to [this recent study and its report](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1474-y) the probability that legacy carbon (organic carbon that has escaped earlier fires and has accumulated at the surface of boreal-forest soils) will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest.

Furthermore it can be harder to rebuild a forest than to prevent its destruction. This is also because a healthy forest requires biodiversity and other things. For example some trees used in some reforesting efforts can prevent the growth of other plants and can prevent growth of diverse vegetation. This in turn can for example also lead to more destructive wildfires in (re)forested areas. [Jonah Busch states](https://earthinnovation.org/2019/05/reforestation-can-help-reverse-the-climate-and-extinction-crises/) that:

>Avoided deforestation offers ten times as much abatement as reforestation at $20 per ton

while:

>reforestation is more cost-effective than avoiding deforestation in some places

Moreover, [according to a 2019 study global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests are being underestimated by a factor of six](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/31/climate-emissions-from-tropical-forest-damage-underestimated-by-a-factor-of-six).

And of course [the effects of af- or reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-keeping-mature-forests-intact-is-key-to-the-climate-fight).

The main issue with reforestation as a solution is that:

>Perhaps the biggest difficulty with reforestation as a strategy is simply that it takes so much time to reap the benefits for global warming. If you plant a seedling today, it will take several decades to get the same carbon sequestration benefits we get from mature trees in tropical forests. So, in the short and medium term, reforestation cannot offer nearly as much benefit as limiting deforestation in the first place.

[as Doug Boucher, UCS Director of Climate Research and Analysis has put it](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/would-reforestation-help-counter-deforestation).

[Here](https://theconversation.com/want-to-beat-climate-change-protect-our-natural-forests-121491) ""the protection and recovery of carbon-rich and long-lived ecosystems, especially natural forests"" is called ""**the major climate solution**"".

>Natural forest systems, with their rich and complex biodiversity, the product of ecological and evolutionary processes, are stable, resilient, far better at adapting to changing conditions and store more carbon than young, degraded or plantation forests. \[...\] proforestation is a more effective, immediate and low-cost method for removing and storing atmospheric carbon in the long-term than tree planting \[...\] Instead of planting entirely new areas, we should prioritise reconnecting forested areas and restoring the edges of forest, to protect their mature core. This means our carbon-storing forests will be more resilient and longer-lasting.

* [There are also **other carbon sinks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) \- including ""ocean afforestation"" - but most aren't as straight-forward and effective as (protection of) forests.
* Forests for climate change mitigation is also about the soil. **Soil health** is another important factor in climate change mitigation and strained by current agriculture (pesticides etc). Healthy soils are also important for sustained food production (especially since population is expected to grow).
* **Peatlands** are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store and ""[although peatlands make up only 3 percent of the Earth's surface, they store one third of the soil carbon trapped in soils globally. Preserving peatlands is therefore of paramount importance for mitigating climate change](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-peatlands-carbon-dioxide-droughts.html)""
* **It needs both reforestation and protection** of forests. [Reforestation is important too](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2017/10/11/1710465114.full.pdf) and is ""[among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76)"" (however [that latter study could have estimated the potential 5 times too large](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay7976)). And theoretically many [young forests can sequester CO2 faster than old forests](https://psmag.com/environment/young-trees-suck-up-more-carbon-than-old-ones). Reforestation projects can also educate and sensitize people to this issue and thereby prevent deforestation.
* I'm **not affiliated** with any of the projects. If this isn't immediately buried I'll keep working on it independently simply because I consider it (effective climate change mitigation within the timeframe of \~10 years) important. The list is incomplete, not only because it puts a focus on technical solutions:
* **If you know of any other project** (or information) that's relevant but not yet included in the list please post a comment and I'll edit the post to add it if it features some some innovative mechanism or technology (i.e. I won't add more projects that have people plant trees by hand except if they e.g. have a new way to coordinate their planting). I'm interested in which projects you think could be most effective and what you think the most difficult root-problems they are facing are."

I'd resuscitated this thing so many times, I can't begin to imagine the labour I've spent on maintenance over the years. 

We bought him a snazzy new laptop 2 years ago, and his desktop began collecting dust. He always kept it set up, and often running, just in case he wanted to print something. There was always a reason. 

I finally managed to convince him that it didn't make sense, servicing this thing for the eleventy-billionth time. However, I offered to salvage the usual (photos, docs, etc, of course not backed up or synced anywhere.)

The pc sat in my garage for 6 months, and tonight is finally had enough of tripping over it. Tonight was the night I would do the final scrape. 

After a measly 3 GB of salvaged data, I initiated the final power-down. 

Poetically, this workhorse's final run was more responsive then I'd remembered. Shutdown time was reasonable, in normal Windows user measure. 

As I started disconnecting cables from this relic, a twinge of sadness struck me. It seemed so similar to a brain dead hospital patient being taken off life support. 

Audio cable. No more will this thing sing cheerily as it wakes up. 

VGA. That's the last of the 1024x768 images this little guy will ever create. Pixel art forever lost. 

KB/mouse. This miracle of technology now sits idle, HID severed. 

LAN. No more monitoring system. Cut off from the outside world. 

Finally, the AC. Stopping the source of life. The whirring of the fans, the clicking of the HDD, gone. 

Once all life support was unhooked, I just stood there, feeling a bit... empty. 

I looked over its organs. Not even anything worth harvesting. 

No one was waiting for any of this stuff. 

No one was depending on a 56k modem, even a sweet US Robotics PCI. 

No one wanted the USB 2.0 card I sourced and ordered from some guy for $4 on eBay and waited 3 weeks for. 

Never mind the 20 gig hard drive I wisely partitioned in half so the system files were somewhat tucked away from prying clicks and deletes. I carry way more storage than that on my pocket every day. 

.
.
.


I know this thing COULD have a use, as a bulky, underpowered media player, or some overgrown calculator. But, it's just time. It happens to us all. We just have to be able to recognize when to let go. 

Farewell, little guy. 

Maybe no one misses you, but you're in my thoughts. "
"How Samsung should dispose of millions of hazardous Note 7 handsets.This is, without a doubt, the first time in the history of consumer electronics that a single product has been recalled so soon after it's release, while at the same time becoming a illegal to take onto an aircraft.

What's more, it's also the shortest lifespan of a flagship smartphone for any company, with the Note 7 lasting only 58 days from it's launch on the 19th August, to being discontinued on the 11th October 2016.

However, to their merit, Samsung have been über responsible with their rapid recall process and granting full refunds and additional $25 and $100 gift vouchers to customers; the higher value vouchers only granted to those who opt for an alternative Samsung handset, rather than a full refund.

Now that Samsung have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of these pocket-sized incendiary devices awaiting disposal, there are a lot of questions which I believe *need* to be asked before the public can breathe easy again, knowing that there will be no more vehicle fires, personal injuries or worse, owing to this device.

The disposal of these devices needs to be carried out with military precision, ensuring that every single device is not only safely destroyed on paper, but physically destroyed to guarantee that the Note 7 will cause no more damage.

Each and *every* returned handset needs to be treated as if it would cost Samsung $1million if it somehow escaped the destruction process - because depending on what damage it could cause, it might well cost them $1million!

This may sound straightforward. After all, there are thousands of responsible E-Waste recyclers all over the world, each promising guaranteed destruction of data and assets.

What makes all of these trustworthy companies, with various accreditations, unsuitable to dispose of the Note 7 en masse?

The first problem will be transporting the devices to the point of destruction. They cannot be carried by air freight. Numerous parcel delivery companies refuse to handle them, and if you were to transport each phone individually in it's own contained sarcophagus, you then have to take into account that a few may go 'missing' in the delivery chain. 
For regular customers, an insurance payout usually takes care of that.
But in this case, the whole point of this program is to 'exterminate' these handsets to avoid further damages to people, property and of course Samsung.

So let's assume that Samsung have conquered the logistics issue somehow.

Where do we send over a million smartphones, each with a potentially deadly battery fault?

E-waste recyclers the Far East would quite happily take care of these handsets. The costs would be relatively low because of the corruption and absence of any serious environmental laws, but this defeats the entire program - you might as well hand them out to kids on Halloween night.

A Chinese e-waste recycler will be handed a million like-new smartphones, each with a retail price of around $900. The *last* thing they will do is feed each and every one of them into the shredder (Even though you wouldn't want to shred them, but we'll come to that).

No doubt a few tens of thousands of them will end up in the Shenzhen market, maybe after a local factory has removed all of the Samsung branding from them for $5 each. 

The resale price in Shenzen? 
$200? $100? Who cares? 

A brand new *unbranded* smartphone with ultra high specification for less than 1/3rd of the cost to have it manufactured? They will sell out within a week. Meanwhile, Samsung are none the wiser and as far as they are concerned, the Note 7s have all been destroyed.

Before you know it, you have simply shifted the problem to China, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Incendiary device is making headlines once again after burning down apartment blocks and cars in China, killing hundreds and injuring thousands. 

Yes, Samsung can wave their arms and show the media the documents which *prove* they had the phones destroyed - but the public's trust in Samsung will sink even lower than it already is.

So you instead opt for an e-waste recycler in Europe or the US - or at least within a country which has little corruption and high environmental standards for recyclers to adhere to.

You then have to ensure that these phones are disposed of in the *correct* way, removing any possibility for parts to be resold or reused, either inside or outside of the disposal chain.

The traditional way to dispose of products is by shredding or granulation. This involves a high-torque set of rotating blades with a feed hopper above them. This method is used extensively throughout the waste industry for everything, from tyres and clothing to banknotes, coinage and e-waste such as laptops, photocopiers and hard drives.

In order to use this method of product destruction, it has a simple requirement - batteries must be removed from the product before they can be shredded. 
This is to prevent explosions and fires from occurring. 

Unfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7 is a sealed unit. This means it's wasn't *designed* to be taken apart. Even if you could, this would be extremely time-consuming, expensive and possibly dangerous - not to mention that it would mean storing these ticking time bombs for an excessive length of time while a small army of factory-floor workers painstakingly remove each and every battery from over a million devices before the less hazardous remains can be shredded.

So, shredding is out of the question - at least unless you want to employ a few hundred staff in haz-mat suits to remove the batteries one by one.

The best option in my opinion is to create a custom disassembly line, whereby the handsets can be robotically placed into a custom built jig. 
You then have an optically guided blade - almost like a cookie cutter - to cut around the entire battery within the phone. This would leave each handset looking like it had a bite taken out of it, but this would be beneficial as this would render most of the components also unusable, while isolating the battery from the rest of the components.

This would minimize the human intervention in the disassembly process, making it safer overall in many ways. Mostly because if any battery did inadvertently explode during the process, the problem can be contained and dealt with quickly with only cosmetic damage to a robot arm, rather than first or second-degree burns to a member of staff. Secondly, by reducing human intervention, you increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of the destruction process.

The Li-Po batteries can then be safely disposed of immediately within the same facility to reduce the length of time between when they are removed and when they are disposed to almost nothing.

After the battery is safely taken care of, the mutilated remains of the devices can then be safely granulated for the recovery of precious metals.

Additionally, because of the huge numbers of these phones which need to be safely destroyed, this is the second most cost effective, and *the* most environmentally friendly method of disposal. This may offer some 

The second option for disposal is less high-tech, less environmentally friendly, but a lot more Mafia-style.

Samsung could simply buy thousands of 55-gallon steel drums, add a good quality concrete mix before mixing in a few hundred Note 7's to each drum, then weld the drum closed and entomb the phones forever. 

This would serve a number of purposes. The most important reason would be fire prevention. Even if a phone *did* self-ignite, there's not much damage it can do when it's surrounded by concrete.
Secondly, it would prevent anybody from stealing them for parts or reselling the entire handsets at all.

The drums can then be buried in a desert somewhere, just as Atari did 30 years ago with the infamous E.T. game they released on the 2600 - although Atari forgot to use steel drums and instead simply covered the games in concrete after dumping them in a New Mexico landfill site.

You could store the drums in an underground repository such as Onkalo in Finland, but this is strictly for nuclear waste. Also, including exploding smartphones on their warning signs which are designed to warn generations 100,000 years from now may not be easy to portray.

This is the least environmentally friendly method. 
The Gold, Silver, Copper and other precious metals cannot be recycled, and any hazardous materials - such as the Lithium in the battery - are left to possibly leak into the environment in the future if the drums are not stored correctly.

Overall, I think that Samsung need to set up their own in-house disposal facility for these phones, rather than outsourcing this essential task to a third party company. This will also reduce the possibility of corruption, and ensure that phones earmarked for destruction *are* physically destroyed.

I hope that when the time comes, Samsung are as open about their disposal process as they have been with their recall process. That is how they will win back the trust of their customers."
"Is technology the universally dominate species?What if technology was the dominat species in the universe, we owe every recent scientific discovery to technology, examples being, particle accelrator, seisographs, microscopes. Currently the state of technology is restricting the amount of development/knowledge humans obtain, preventing us from learning about the universe. Its a non reproductive organism and has mastered the dominance of every species to ever live. Every species is bound to the amount of intelligence it can gain by technology. As intelligence increases so must the rate of technology, at some point the technology is more advanced than the biological organisms themselves and can choose to eliminate the bounded biological organism (5senses) (technology has infinite). Technology, is a self evolving, non reproducing, abiotic species, by this method of growth technology can eliminate any inter specific competition as it itself can limit their rate of evolution.
One day we will become intelligent enough to develop AI’s, these AI’s will eventually be intelligent enough to produce more of themselves and sustain themselves (as in iRobot), this could be the cut off point where all biotic life gets killed by the robots and the world they created now with insane amount of technology is theirs to live in. Is it not fair to say that all biotic creatures are bounded by their own senses. A person not exposed to technology cannot see that the sun contains the same elements as here on earth. Nor would that person be able to see that elements existed. Technology is needed to evolve past a certain point. Once the first bit of technology is created by a biotic species its a simple wait for that technology to get to the point in which is becomes an AI and can easily defeat a species bounded by only 5 senses. 
In summary, technology could be the universal dominat species. It grows alongside biotic species and can overthrow them as soon as it becomes self dependent. It has no emotional attachment as its is abiotic meaning that it can kill its creators. It is a self expanding species because it does not need water/food/resources to survive. Maybe this is why we haven’t come across any other intelligent biotic lifeforms in our universe. They were all beaten by technology which chooses not to expand outwards as it has no need to.  "
"Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC]If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"Technological Change and Mental Health: How will the workforce of the future cope with the 4th industrial revolution?This article was published on [KevinMD](https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/06/technological-change-and-mental-health-how-will-the-workforce-of-the-future-cope-with-the-fourth-industrial-revolution.html) and [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/202006/technological-change-and-mental-health).

Work is a necessary part of life. More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose.

While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological “revolutions.” Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general.

This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts — particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-migrant-workers-miserable/589423/) or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems.

Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab)) now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on.

While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the “job” by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority.

**The Rise of the Precariat**

All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.

This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moore’s Law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweil’s Law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.

This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years — in regions like the Rust Belt, for example — and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words “precarious” and “proletariat”) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.

If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.

While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy “bot” can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people?

This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do?

**The Impact on Mental Health**

While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health.

Many of them have already materialized.

I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults.

As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone — even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349722/).

Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial “giving 110%” here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership.

Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](https://www.ft.com/content/e61ca2e2-18f0-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996) should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) physical and mental health problems associated with “[worklessness](https://thischangedmypractice.com/the-risks-of-worklessness/)” (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression).

**The Role of Mental Health Professionals**

Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life.

For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients’ conditions if we are to properly treat them."
"Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC]If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

"A foldable drone that can rescue survivors from collapsed buildings**Abstract**

The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this work, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute.  No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.

"Technological Change and Mental Health: How will the workforce of the future cope with the 4th industrial revolution?This article was published on [KevinMD](https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/06/technological-change-and-mental-health-how-will-the-workforce-of-the-future-cope-with-the-fourth-industrial-revolution.html) and [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/202006/technological-change-and-mental-health).

Work is a necessary part of life. More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose.

While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological “revolutions.” Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general.

This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts — particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-migrant-workers-miserable/589423/) or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems.

Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab)) now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on.

While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the “job” by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority.

**The Rise of the Precariat**

All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.

This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moore’s Law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweil’s Law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.

This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years — in regions like the Rust Belt, for example — and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words “precarious” and “proletariat”) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.

If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.

While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy “bot” can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people?

This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do?

**The Impact on Mental Health**

While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health.

Many of them have already materialized.

I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults.

As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone — even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349722/).

Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial “giving 110%” here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership.

Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](https://www.ft.com/content/e61ca2e2-18f0-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996) should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) physical and mental health problems associated with “[worklessness](https://thischangedmypractice.com/the-risks-of-worklessness/)” (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression).

**The Role of Mental Health Professionals**

Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life.

For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients’ conditions if we are to properly treat them."
"iPhone to Android? Questions...I read an article this morning on a guy who was going to make the switch. I too am in a similar position but I need to know a few things that I could not find any user opinion on.

1) How does the Android OS handle podcasts? I am a frequent podcast listener and I hat the way the iPhone does it. 

2) How does the android work on video sites? On the iphone, you can use youtube with no problems but other sites may not be compatible because they use flash players.

3) Does the android allow you to download MP3s and play them? I make music as a hobby and sometimes I dropbox my latest MP3s up[ to the cloud. I would love to be able to just point my phone at them, grab em and go. Right now I have to put into iTunes and sync my phone which takes at least an hour because of backups and such that the phone performs every time.

If anyone has any useful input on these questions I would be very grateful."

"Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC]If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

"How do you feel about hardware being made obsolete and disposed of because the new product has more features which turn out to be only software.I have noticed that with increasing regularity, technology being made obsolete or being superseded by the ""next generation"" for marketing reasons only, the next generation only has some token hardware changes which don't really matter but a plethora of software changes that fundamentally make the device better  
Case in point, the iphone 4 did not have siri, the iphone 4s did, apple claimed the iphone 4 was not capable of running siri, and yet myself and thousands of others (with jailbroken phones) used siri for years without issue.  
**Algorithms and software features are the defining make or break factor of most products on sale today**  \- More and more, the hardware in devices (be it phones , tablets, stand alone cameras, robot vacuum cleaners, drones etc) is identical (processors and other hardware alike) or marginally different in the next generation of device where the ""big features"" being touted turn out to just be improved algorithms for image processing, flight planning, cleaning paths, beauty modes or new features, something the old hardware would not only benefit from, but could more than easily support.  


Now this has gone on for many years, however with hardware changes in new products starting to plateau as we hit the limits of our current miniaturization technology, this is beginning to happen everywhere I look in all hardware i use from tv's, to cars, to smart watches, to phones, to benders etc.  


This has discussion has been stemmed from a product i own (a roborock s50 robot vacuum cleaner), the company announced its successor and touted a bunch of new features, the primary of which is improved algorithms for cleaning paths, I am just sitting here thinking.... and why aren't these improved algorithms on my hardware because the difference between the s6 and s50 is practically nothing, and I am tired of my old tech being disposed of or otherwise wasted because the manufacturer decided to make it obsolete rather than because it is genuinely incapable."
"I'm really worried about AI.After watching Ex Machina, I've started to become really paranoid about artificial intelligence. I definitely realize that this fear is irrational, but I feel that with the rate that technology is increasing, it is only a matter of time before the technological singularity. This is something that I'm genuinely worried about.

"Technocrats of Reddit: What are your concerns, if any, about what the future holds in terms of how cyber-security relates to robotics? Oh and here's a bit of dry humor (irony maybe?) to maybe lighten the mood? I'm literally anxious that this'll be removed via bot within 1 second of me posting this.First of all I am not trying to create a panic, but I am curious if others share my fear of what is to come. 

Sure, google cars are way better at driving than humans in good weather conditions and visibility. Also, autopilot systems in commercial aircraft seem like they also have great track records. No, I do not think Skynet is coming to get us and we are doomed.

However, I can't help but realize that mistakes *WILL* happen and bad people *WILL* purposefully accelerate the process. 20 years ago, if someone had told me that Stuxnet was going to happen I would not even be able to comprehend it. I was also quite surprised to recently discover there is a zombie botnet buying items on ebay with stolen credit card data. 

I also like the idea of Amazon flying parcels to my doorstep within minutes of me deciding I need something right away. I am sure it will be a great success for the most part, but I just can't get this nagging sense of some impending catastrophe out of my mind 100%.

I am not suggestion that they would be careless enough to lose control of their fleet, but I have seen enough of what botnets armed with stolen credit cards can do to suggest to me some things could happen that would not normally be possible.

Anyways, what do you guys think on this subject and what may come?

Here are some relatively benign robots that got me thinking about it, it is when I realized that orders will not just be shipped on drones but that it seems they may be looking to 100% automate the process at least on some items: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazons-robot-worker-challenge-won-by-ai-powered-suction-arm/

"Heres why robots taking all jobs would be goodOk so the reason why it would be good for robots to take all jobs is because if robots took all jobs, they would be much more efficient obviously, and  the main topic of this post, everything would be free. If you think about it, money is what’s causing most of the bad things in the world. Robbery, money. Homelessness, money. Orphans, money (most of the time). Sickness and hunger, money. And why do we still have money? Because people wont work without a reward because we need some incentive to work. But, if robots worked, do they need money, or a reward? What would they want, grape flavored nuts and bolts? No, they wouldn’t. As long as they’re programmed correctly, they don’t need a reward. Now, you may be thinking, “What about the jobs that robots can’t do? Like game designer, artist, movie creator, stuff like that.”. Well, I thought of a solution for that too. If everything was free and robot doctors and stuff are more efficient and better, than the population would grow so much. Now, by then we would probably be able to colonize planets. But if we can’t, than the people that still work can get some bonus incentives like for example, more land than other people like a bigger house or something since it would be overcrowded because of the population and most people would live in apartments. Or maybe something else. You guys can make some suggestions in the comments. Anyways, let me now address the solutions to the problems to make myself more clear. Robbery, you won’t need to steal if everything’s free. People will probably take more than they need though. As a solution to that, maybe a limit on how much they can take? Like 1 apple a day, 1 couch a year something like that. Now for the thing that most of you guys have probably been thinking, “Well, they can get hacked.”. That is a major flaw as no matter how much cyber security we get, there will still be hackers. Maybe if we have a perfect society like this, criminals will stop. But honestly, thats just a dream. No matter how good we get, there will always be those few bad apples that ruin the bunch. I can’t really think of a solution for that. If any of you guys can think of one, let me know down in the comments and I will edit this post and credit you. Thanks for reading this! Goodbye for now!

"Technological Change and Mental Health: How will the workforce of the future cope with the 4th industrial revolution?This article was published on [KevinMD](https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/06/technological-change-and-mental-health-how-will-the-workforce-of-the-future-cope-with-the-fourth-industrial-revolution.html) and [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/202006/technological-change-and-mental-health).

Work is a necessary part of life. More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose.

While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological “revolutions.” Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general.

This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts — particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-migrant-workers-miserable/589423/) or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems.

Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab)) now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on.

While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the “job” by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority.

**The Rise of the Precariat**

All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.

This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moore’s Law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweil’s Law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.

This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years — in regions like the Rust Belt, for example — and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words “precarious” and “proletariat”) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.

If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.

While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy “bot” can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people?

This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do?

**The Impact on Mental Health**

While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health.

Many of them have already materialized.

I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults.

As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone — even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349722/).

Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial “giving 110%” here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership.

Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](https://www.ft.com/content/e61ca2e2-18f0-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996) should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) physical and mental health problems associated with “[worklessness](https://thischangedmypractice.com/the-risks-of-worklessness/)” (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression).

**The Role of Mental Health Professionals**

Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life.

For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients’ conditions if we are to properly treat them."
"Google is fucking brilliant**Speech recognition:**

Google started off with their GOOG411 service and basic speech recognition, to improve their results.

Then they moved up to Google Voice to further improve their results.

Then they brought their speech technology to android.

Then they brought it to search boxes online.

**Image/object recognition:**

The started off with google goggles to improve results.

Then they came out with ""similar images"" on google image search.

Then they came out with reverse image search.

Now they have continuous mode in google goggles, and they are getting people to submit suggestions for objects/images recognized in these images.

**Google is leveraging their services online and on their android phones to improve their audio and visual recognition, which will surely be used in their Google X laboratory for robot/AI development.**

By contributing to these services (Goggles, Voice Search, Google Voice, Reverse Image Search), you are contributing to Artificial Intelligence research which could lead to some very smart robots, cars, security, phones, operating systems, and online services."
"Singularity Summit Melbourne Australia 20-21 August 2011 - last day for early bird ticketsThe Singularity Summit is Coming to Town (20-21 August 2011)!

The Singularity Summit is an annual conference focused on the Singularity and related converging technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

On present trends, computers will have more powerful ""brains"" than humans by around 2030. It's likely that this, and corresponding developments in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology and medicine will fundamentally change the world we live in. This will affect every one of us in profound ways that are only dimly understood. 

The Singularity represents an ""event horizon"" in the predictability of human technological development. We have no means to predict the behaviour of entities smarter and more capable than ourselves so our models of the future cease to give reliable answers. While some regard the Singularity as a positive event and work to hasten its arrival, others have misgivings. We debate and discuss the most practical means for initiating the Singularity, and how, or whether, it can be influenced or managed. The Singularity Summits lead the world's dialogue on the Singularity, bringing together scientists, technologists, sceptics, and enthusiasts alike.

The summit will explore the important human and philosophical dimensions of the Singularity. Presentations will explore how can we plan rationally for Transhumanism, how can we ensure that the beneficial potential of the Singularity is realised, and how do we manage the risks involved. David Chalmers and others will examine how the Singularity will stretch our understanding of what it is to be human, to be conscious, and how our moral intuitions can extend to a world of non-human and partly-human intelligences.

It is hypothesized that Machines will out think by Computers before the middle of this century.

Professor Hugo de Garis says in History Channel's documentary Prophets of Doom ""It is only a question of time now before humanity can build artificial brains that are far more intelligent than human beings. So this is a huge issue that will eclipse any other human issue this century...I call this 'Species dominance'.""

Although this sounds like science fiction, its starting to take this very seriously.  This year the Singularity has made the cover of Time Magazine, and the topic of a feature documentary 'Transcendent Man' has been .  You have people like Larry Page (CEO of Google) taking an interest in this stuff, prominent public figures willing to associate their names with the Singularity, its definitely a move from the fringes, if not yet into the mainstream, then a lot closer..

""If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now a lot happens in 6 months."" says Ray Kurzweil in documentary Transcendent Man.  ""Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster, it's going to continue, and in about 40 years it is going to become so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless, you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we have created.""

This conference will challenge and enhance your view of the future.

"Tell the truth in a way Macy can understandIt is a given, this world is growing into a big ball of chaos. It is shrinking in virtual size, becoming more open, and easily accessible. A lot can be accomplished with a click of a button, from important decisions being made to colossal amounts of money being transferred to countries that are miles away. We live and breath in a world that is so fragile – where one wrong move can send hackers a million opportunities for them to use their scary skills in the manner that makes us grind our teeth – within a split second. This kind of world – one that is speeding on the highway to robotic glory – requires a special kind of attention when it comes to security.

Security can mean different things to different people. For some, its knowing that their home is protected from thieves running about the streets, and for others, its the same assurance guaranteeing their personal data is protected from cyber burglars, that are hungry to feast on fresh confidential knowledge.

The fact of the matter is, we live in an animal kingdom (and we always have been!) – we just keep forgetting. Somewhere along the journey of evolution, people introduced a rigid system of law and order; a system that claims to protect life and property from those that are envious, or feel inferior. But what our founders failed to acknowledge is that introducing a judicial system does not automatically stop crime.

As technology lays down the rules for the 21st century, global relations and habits become more intertwined and complex than a spider’s web. The complexity of computer science has gained so much power over the ordinary mind, that it is slowly becoming difficult for tech-average folk to keep up, or even remotely, understand the consequences of having personal information on the line.

It is paramount for people to realise that the world of technology is literally like a world. Despite having knowledge on longitude, latitude and land mass, there is always something new to discover, that may change or influence the existence of things. Therefore, putting your personal data out there is your responsibility, no one else’s. And yes, there are security geniuses that help you shield this personal data, but ultimately shielding comes from within your mind.

To all those clever tech gurus out there: bring justice to the term ‘guru’. Things need to be taken it down a few notches. People need to know what it really means to be “online”. They need to be truly tech-aware in this fathomless age. The wrinkles in the spread of knowledge need to be ironed out.

Tell the truth in a way Macy can understand."

"Is technology the universally dominate species?What if technology was the dominat species in the universe, we owe every recent scientific discovery to technology, examples being, particle accelrator, seisographs, microscopes. Currently the state of technology is restricting the amount of development/knowledge humans obtain, preventing us from learning about the universe. Its a non reproductive organism and has mastered the dominance of every species to ever live. Every species is bound to the amount of intelligence it can gain by technology. As intelligence increases so must the rate of technology, at some point the technology is more advanced than the biological organisms themselves and can choose to eliminate the bounded biological organism (5senses) (technology has infinite). Technology, is a self evolving, non reproducing, abiotic species, by this method of growth technology can eliminate any inter specific competition as it itself can limit their rate of evolution.
One day we will become intelligent enough to develop AI’s, these AI’s will eventually be intelligent enough to produce more of themselves and sustain themselves (as in iRobot), this could be the cut off point where all biotic life gets killed by the robots and the world they created now with insane amount of technology is theirs to live in. Is it not fair to say that all biotic creatures are bounded by their own senses. A person not exposed to technology cannot see that the sun contains the same elements as here on earth. Nor would that person be able to see that elements existed. Technology is needed to evolve past a certain point. Once the first bit of technology is created by a biotic species its a simple wait for that technology to get to the point in which is becomes an AI and can easily defeat a species bounded by only 5 senses. 
In summary, technology could be the universal dominat species. It grows alongside biotic species and can overthrow them as soon as it becomes self dependent. It has no emotional attachment as its is abiotic meaning that it can kill its creators. It is a self expanding species because it does not need water/food/resources to survive. Maybe this is why we haven’t come across any other intelligent biotic lifeforms in our universe. They were all beaten by technology which chooses not to expand outwards as it has no need to.  "
"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."

To me the idea of deploying essentially what would be 'Terminators' into a combat zone is rather terrifying and would be poor moral judgement. However, at the same time, I can't help thinking this would be the coolest thing EVAR! What are your thoughts Reddit? "
"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"Singularity Summit Melbourne Australia 20-21 August 2011 - last day for early bird ticketsThe Singularity Summit is Coming to Town (20-21 August 2011)!

The Singularity Summit is an annual conference focused on the Singularity and related converging technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

On present trends, computers will have more powerful ""brains"" than humans by around 2030. It's likely that this, and corresponding developments in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology and medicine will fundamentally change the world we live in. This will affect every one of us in profound ways that are only dimly understood. 

The Singularity represents an ""event horizon"" in the predictability of human technological development. We have no means to predict the behaviour of entities smarter and more capable than ourselves so our models of the future cease to give reliable answers. While some regard the Singularity as a positive event and work to hasten its arrival, others have misgivings. We debate and discuss the most practical means for initiating the Singularity, and how, or whether, it can be influenced or managed. The Singularity Summits lead the world's dialogue on the Singularity, bringing together scientists, technologists, sceptics, and enthusiasts alike.

The summit will explore the important human and philosophical dimensions of the Singularity. Presentations will explore how can we plan rationally for Transhumanism, how can we ensure that the beneficial potential of the Singularity is realised, and how do we manage the risks involved. David Chalmers and others will examine how the Singularity will stretch our understanding of what it is to be human, to be conscious, and how our moral intuitions can extend to a world of non-human and partly-human intelligences.

It is hypothesized that Machines will out think by Computers before the middle of this century.

Professor Hugo de Garis says in History Channel's documentary Prophets of Doom ""It is only a question of time now before humanity can build artificial brains that are far more intelligent than human beings. So this is a huge issue that will eclipse any other human issue this century...I call this 'Species dominance'.""

Although this sounds like science fiction, its starting to take this very seriously.  This year the Singularity has made the cover of Time Magazine, and the topic of a feature documentary 'Transcendent Man' has been .  You have people like Larry Page (CEO of Google) taking an interest in this stuff, prominent public figures willing to associate their names with the Singularity, its definitely a move from the fringes, if not yet into the mainstream, then a lot closer..

""If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now a lot happens in 6 months."" says Ray Kurzweil in documentary Transcendent Man.  ""Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster, it's going to continue, and in about 40 years it is going to become so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless, you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we have created.""

This conference will challenge and enhance your view of the future.

"Technocrats of Reddit: What are your concerns, if any, about what the future holds in terms of how cyber-security relates to robotics? Oh and here's a bit of dry humor (irony maybe?) to maybe lighten the mood? I'm literally anxious that this'll be removed via bot within 1 second of me posting this.First of all I am not trying to create a panic, but I am curious if others share my fear of what is to come. 

Sure, google cars are way better at driving than humans in good weather conditions and visibility. Also, autopilot systems in commercial aircraft seem like they also have great track records. No, I do not think Skynet is coming to get us and we are doomed.

However, I can't help but realize that mistakes *WILL* happen and bad people *WILL* purposefully accelerate the process. 20 years ago, if someone had told me that Stuxnet was going to happen I would not even be able to comprehend it. I was also quite surprised to recently discover there is a zombie botnet buying items on ebay with stolen credit card data. 

I also like the idea of Amazon flying parcels to my doorstep within minutes of me deciding I need something right away. I am sure it will be a great success for the most part, but I just can't get this nagging sense of some impending catastrophe out of my mind 100%.

I am not suggestion that they would be careless enough to lose control of their fleet, but I have seen enough of what botnets armed with stolen credit cards can do to suggest to me some things could happen that would not normally be possible.

Anyways, what do you guys think on this subject and what may come?

Here are some relatively benign robots that got me thinking about it, it is when I realized that orders will not just be shipped on drones but that it seems they may be looking to 100% automate the process at least on some items: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazons-robot-worker-challenge-won-by-ai-powered-suction-arm/

"""Someone will have to build, maintain, repair, etc. the robots"" — Ever read this? Here's a refutation (x-post from /r/Futurology)The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a AA battery. 
If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside.

"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created.

# Why preventing deforestation is more important:

From the latest [Global Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) it seems to be clear that it would be more effective to stop deforestation than to allow it to happen and subsequently reforest.

For example, [as the European Commission writes](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-08-632_en.htm):

>In terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to cut down trees and reforest subsequently, as deforestation leads to some irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

[On Wikipedia it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#Criticisms):

>There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.

and according to [this recent study and its report](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1474-y) the probability that legacy carbon (organic carbon that has escaped earlier fires and has accumulated at the surface of boreal-forest soils) will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest.

Furthermore it can be harder to rebuild a forest than to prevent its destruction. This is also because a healthy forest requires biodiversity and other things. For example some trees used in some reforesting efforts can prevent the growth of other plants and can prevent growth of diverse vegetation. This in turn can for example also lead to more destructive wildfires in (re)forested areas. [Jonah Busch states](https://earthinnovation.org/2019/05/reforestation-can-help-reverse-the-climate-and-extinction-crises/) that:

>Avoided deforestation offers ten times as much abatement as reforestation at $20 per ton

while:

>reforestation is more cost-effective than avoiding deforestation in some places

Moreover, [according to a 2019 study global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests are being underestimated by a factor of six](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/31/climate-emissions-from-tropical-forest-damage-underestimated-by-a-factor-of-six).

And of course [the effects of af- or reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-keeping-mature-forests-intact-is-key-to-the-climate-fight).

The main issue with reforestation as a solution is that:

>Perhaps the biggest difficulty with reforestation as a strategy is simply that it takes so much time to reap the benefits for global warming. If you plant a seedling today, it will take several decades to get the same carbon sequestration benefits we get from mature trees in tropical forests. So, in the short and medium term, reforestation cannot offer nearly as much benefit as limiting deforestation in the first place.

[as Doug Boucher, UCS Director of Climate Research and Analysis has put it](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/would-reforestation-help-counter-deforestation).

[Here](https://theconversation.com/want-to-beat-climate-change-protect-our-natural-forests-121491) ""the protection and recovery of carbon-rich and long-lived ecosystems, especially natural forests"" is called ""**the major climate solution**"".

>Natural forest systems, with their rich and complex biodiversity, the product of ecological and evolutionary processes, are stable, resilient, far better at adapting to changing conditions and store more carbon than young, degraded or plantation forests. \[...\] proforestation is a more effective, immediate and low-cost method for removing and storing atmospheric carbon in the long-term than tree planting \[...\] Instead of planting entirely new areas, we should prioritise reconnecting forested areas and restoring the edges of forest, to protect their mature core. This means our carbon-storing forests will be more resilient and longer-lasting.

* [There are also **other carbon sinks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) \- including ""ocean afforestation"" - but most aren't as straight-forward and effective as (protection of) forests.
* Forests for climate change mitigation is also about the soil. **Soil health** is another important factor in climate change mitigation and strained by current agriculture (pesticides etc). Healthy soils are also important for sustained food production (especially since population is expected to grow).
* **Peatlands** are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store and ""[although peatlands make up only 3 percent of the Earth's surface, they store one third of the soil carbon trapped in soils globally. Preserving peatlands is therefore of paramount importance for mitigating climate change](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-peatlands-carbon-dioxide-droughts.html)""
* **It needs both reforestation and protection** of forests. [Reforestation is important too](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2017/10/11/1710465114.full.pdf) and is ""[among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76)"" (however [that latter study could have estimated the potential 5 times too large](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay7976)). And theoretically many [young forests can sequester CO2 faster than old forests](https://psmag.com/environment/young-trees-suck-up-more-carbon-than-old-ones). Reforestation projects can also educate and sensitize people to this issue and thereby prevent deforestation.
* I'm **not affiliated** with any of the projects. If this isn't immediately buried I'll keep working on it independently simply because I consider it (effective climate change mitigation within the timeframe of \~10 years) important. The list is incomplete, not only because it puts a focus on technical solutions:
* **If you know of any other project** (or information) that's relevant but not yet included in the list please post a comment and I'll edit the post to add it if it features some some innovative mechanism or technology (i.e. I won't add more projects that have people plant trees by hand except if they e.g. have a new way to coordinate their planting). I'm interested in which projects you think could be most effective and what you think the most difficult root-problems they are facing are."
"A foldable drone that can rescue survivors from collapsed buildings**Abstract**

The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this work, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute.  No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.

"How Samsung should dispose of millions of hazardous Note 7 handsets.This is, without a doubt, the first time in the history of consumer electronics that a single product has been recalled so soon after it's release, while at the same time becoming a illegal to take onto an aircraft.

What's more, it's also the shortest lifespan of a flagship smartphone for any company, with the Note 7 lasting only 58 days from it's launch on the 19th August, to being discontinued on the 11th October 2016.

However, to their merit, Samsung have been über responsible with their rapid recall process and granting full refunds and additional $25 and $100 gift vouchers to customers; the higher value vouchers only granted to those who opt for an alternative Samsung handset, rather than a full refund.

Now that Samsung have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of these pocket-sized incendiary devices awaiting disposal, there are a lot of questions which I believe *need* to be asked before the public can breathe easy again, knowing that there will be no more vehicle fires, personal injuries or worse, owing to this device.

The disposal of these devices needs to be carried out with military precision, ensuring that every single device is not only safely destroyed on paper, but physically destroyed to guarantee that the Note 7 will cause no more damage.

Each and *every* returned handset needs to be treated as if it would cost Samsung $1million if it somehow escaped the destruction process - because depending on what damage it could cause, it might well cost them $1million!

This may sound straightforward. After all, there are thousands of responsible E-Waste recyclers all over the world, each promising guaranteed destruction of data and assets.

What makes all of these trustworthy companies, with various accreditations, unsuitable to dispose of the Note 7 en masse?

The first problem will be transporting the devices to the point of destruction. They cannot be carried by air freight. Numerous parcel delivery companies refuse to handle them, and if you were to transport each phone individually in it's own contained sarcophagus, you then have to take into account that a few may go 'missing' in the delivery chain. 
For regular customers, an insurance payout usually takes care of that.
But in this case, the whole point of this program is to 'exterminate' these handsets to avoid further damages to people, property and of course Samsung.

So let's assume that Samsung have conquered the logistics issue somehow.

Where do we send over a million smartphones, each with a potentially deadly battery fault?

E-waste recyclers the Far East would quite happily take care of these handsets. The costs would be relatively low because of the corruption and absence of any serious environmental laws, but this defeats the entire program - you might as well hand them out to kids on Halloween night.

A Chinese e-waste recycler will be handed a million like-new smartphones, each with a retail price of around $900. The *last* thing they will do is feed each and every one of them into the shredder (Even though you wouldn't want to shred them, but we'll come to that).

No doubt a few tens of thousands of them will end up in the Shenzhen market, maybe after a local factory has removed all of the Samsung branding from them for $5 each. 

The resale price in Shenzen? 
$200? $100? Who cares? 

A brand new *unbranded* smartphone with ultra high specification for less than 1/3rd of the cost to have it manufactured? They will sell out within a week. Meanwhile, Samsung are none the wiser and as far as they are concerned, the Note 7s have all been destroyed.

Before you know it, you have simply shifted the problem to China, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Incendiary device is making headlines once again after burning down apartment blocks and cars in China, killing hundreds and injuring thousands. 

Yes, Samsung can wave their arms and show the media the documents which *prove* they had the phones destroyed - but the public's trust in Samsung will sink even lower than it already is.

So you instead opt for an e-waste recycler in Europe or the US - or at least within a country which has little corruption and high environmental standards for recyclers to adhere to.

You then have to ensure that these phones are disposed of in the *correct* way, removing any possibility for parts to be resold or reused, either inside or outside of the disposal chain.

The traditional way to dispose of products is by shredding or granulation. This involves a high-torque set of rotating blades with a feed hopper above them. This method is used extensively throughout the waste industry for everything, from tyres and clothing to banknotes, coinage and e-waste such as laptops, photocopiers and hard drives.

In order to use this method of product destruction, it has a simple requirement - batteries must be removed from the product before they can be shredded. 
This is to prevent explosions and fires from occurring. 

Unfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7 is a sealed unit. This means it's wasn't *designed* to be taken apart. Even if you could, this would be extremely time-consuming, expensive and possibly dangerous - not to mention that it would mean storing these ticking time bombs for an excessive length of time while a small army of factory-floor workers painstakingly remove each and every battery from over a million devices before the less hazardous remains can be shredded.

So, shredding is out of the question - at least unless you want to employ a few hundred staff in haz-mat suits to remove the batteries one by one.

The best option in my opinion is to create a custom disassembly line, whereby the handsets can be robotically placed into a custom built jig. 
You then have an optically guided blade - almost like a cookie cutter - to cut around the entire battery within the phone. This would leave each handset looking like it had a bite taken out of it, but this would be beneficial as this would render most of the components also unusable, while isolating the battery from the rest of the components.

This would minimize the human intervention in the disassembly process, making it safer overall in many ways. Mostly because if any battery did inadvertently explode during the process, the problem can be contained and dealt with quickly with only cosmetic damage to a robot arm, rather than first or second-degree burns to a member of staff. Secondly, by reducing human intervention, you increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of the destruction process.

The Li-Po batteries can then be safely disposed of immediately within the same facility to reduce the length of time between when they are removed and when they are disposed to almost nothing.

After the battery is safely taken care of, the mutilated remains of the devices can then be safely granulated for the recovery of precious metals.

Additionally, because of the huge numbers of these phones which need to be safely destroyed, this is the second most cost effective, and *the* most environmentally friendly method of disposal. This may offer some 

The second option for disposal is less high-tech, less environmentally friendly, but a lot more Mafia-style.

Samsung could simply buy thousands of 55-gallon steel drums, add a good quality concrete mix before mixing in a few hundred Note 7's to each drum, then weld the drum closed and entomb the phones forever. 

This would serve a number of purposes. The most important reason would be fire prevention. Even if a phone *did* self-ignite, there's not much damage it can do when it's surrounded by concrete.
Secondly, it would prevent anybody from stealing them for parts or reselling the entire handsets at all.

The drums can then be buried in a desert somewhere, just as Atari did 30 years ago with the infamous E.T. game they released on the 2600 - although Atari forgot to use steel drums and instead simply covered the games in concrete after dumping them in a New Mexico landfill site.

You could store the drums in an underground repository such as Onkalo in Finland, but this is strictly for nuclear waste. Also, including exploding smartphones on their warning signs which are designed to warn generations 100,000 years from now may not be easy to portray.

This is the least environmentally friendly method. 
The Gold, Silver, Copper and other precious metals cannot be recycled, and any hazardous materials - such as the Lithium in the battery - are left to possibly leak into the environment in the future if the drums are not stored correctly.

Overall, I think that Samsung need to set up their own in-house disposal facility for these phones, rather than outsourcing this essential task to a third party company. This will also reduce the possibility of corruption, and ensure that phones earmarked for destruction *are* physically destroyed.

I hope that when the time comes, Samsung are as open about their disposal process as they have been with their recall process. That is how they will win back the trust of their customers."
"We are automating the wrong jobs first - how we shall keep control over what we create. Obligations.Anyone smart enough to build a time machine should be smart enough to know that you can't build it because if Kim Jong Un is your Biff Tannen, then that's where it all ends.  Just, keep that in mind.

As part data admin, part somewhat developer for geospatial datas, it's becoming more and more part of the game to develope models that execute large scale, multi-step geoprocessing tasks based on numerous decision points.  Basically, you're training the computer to do all the steps you would do if this were your job - which it was your job until you told the computer how to do it.  Now you're a computer job stealer babysitter at best - at worst you're the other guy that did that job but didn't create the job vortex model, so now you're fired.  

False.  Those are both 'the at worsts'.  At best you're the guy that told the guy to build the job killing robot, because now he's got the worker robot, nobody to tell him what to do with it, and a higher salary because there are less humans.  Second best case scenario would be if you're the actual computer program.

So that's about all you need to know in the way of who the winners and losers are here.  ""You're workin' yerself out of a job there, Pedro. eh heh heh."" 

What we should be doing:
Automating that bullshit the guy telling you to work you of a job is doing day to day on our own time.  Listen, the middleman is - they're the weakest link in the chain what limits the rest of the badass links.  They are both the sloth and the greed.  I believe it was John who said ""While the path of the middle may haste make easy, it is the path closest to the light what ignores haste all together.""  Basically, if you just do what's right, you don't have to take the lazy path because it won't matter.

I'm just kidding, I made that shit up, but you know who I'm talking about and why.  The scrapers off the top, the taxman, the whoever was in charge of the indentured servent back in the day.  That guy.  That guy SHALL NOT be left to his devices with our devices.  Look, you think Einstein would have helped build that bomb if he knew how cartoonish those and the system who would wield its power would become?  IDK, maybe.  You would think not, but then again two scientists were racing at the time for the good of all mankind.  Again, we're not talking about atomic bombs or anything like that here, but we are talking about automating anything from manufacturing to large analytical code models, to you name it.  It has to be in the hands of the trustworthy, period.
Lookit, I was trying to figure out how to keep the model I was working on today to keep from duplicating certain shit and giving  me terrible results.  It occurred to me that the way to do it was to just delete the weakest possibilities before I started.  And now here we are, applying that to the overall lifecycle of the things we invent as computing gets faster and faster and more people are in a position to wield huge amounts of data/processing/AI libraries/ WTF ever.  The best way to do that is to put the people who don't take the middleman's approach in charge, and the way to do that is to be in charge before you build the, IDK whatever it is.  And as we learned earlier, the best way to do that is to automate their job.

Essentially what we need is a running list of ""middleman bullshit tasks"" then model those out.  Then start a business where the computer is the middleman and the non middleman people are all you really need.  

Now you can get to automating something cool with less worry.

Open to suggestions for implementations.

Also, I won't be responding to this thread very often I don't think for the next couple days since I'm about to go on a camping trip, but I wanted to put this out here while I had a chance."

"Heres why robots taking all jobs would be goodOk so the reason why it would be good for robots to take all jobs is because if robots took all jobs, they would be much more efficient obviously, and  the main topic of this post, everything would be free. If you think about it, money is what’s causing most of the bad things in the world. Robbery, money. Homelessness, money. Orphans, money (most of the time). Sickness and hunger, money. And why do we still have money? Because people wont work without a reward because we need some incentive to work. But, if robots worked, do they need money, or a reward? What would they want, grape flavored nuts and bolts? No, they wouldn’t. As long as they’re programmed correctly, they don’t need a reward. Now, you may be thinking, “What about the jobs that robots can’t do? Like game designer, artist, movie creator, stuff like that.”. Well, I thought of a solution for that too. If everything was free and robot doctors and stuff are more efficient and better, than the population would grow so much. Now, by then we would probably be able to colonize planets. But if we can’t, than the people that still work can get some bonus incentives like for example, more land than other people like a bigger house or something since it would be overcrowded because of the population and most people would live in apartments. Or maybe something else. You guys can make some suggestions in the comments. Anyways, let me now address the solutions to the problems to make myself more clear. Robbery, you won’t need to steal if everything’s free. People will probably take more than they need though. As a solution to that, maybe a limit on how much they can take? Like 1 apple a day, 1 couch a year something like that. Now for the thing that most of you guys have probably been thinking, “Well, they can get hacked.”. That is a major flaw as no matter how much cyber security we get, there will still be hackers. Maybe if we have a perfect society like this, criminals will stop. But honestly, thats just a dream. No matter how good we get, there will always be those few bad apples that ruin the bunch. I can’t really think of a solution for that. If any of you guys can think of one, let me know down in the comments and I will edit this post and credit you. Thanks for reading this! Goodbye for now!

People aren’t perfect and I’m ok with that. I’d rather us just accept and appreciate our imperfections and differences rather than try to genetically engineer and augment everyone to be perfect.

"Capitalism Evolves— Technostism, Or Why Economic Evolution Is InevitableEconomic systems evolve. Mercantilism evolved into capitalism. Capitalism is evolving into technostism. It was an inevitable development, actually.

I find it akin to human evolution. From *Australeopithecus* (mercantilism) to *Homo* (capitalism) to *Who-Knows-What* (technostism).

/r/Technostism is the trans/posthuman successor to what we are now, and it was only possible through our ingenuity. 

Capitalism begets technological innovation! This is not denied, surely.
Feudalism, theocracy, authoritarian socialism, command economies of that nature obviously do not lead to extreme economic growth. National socialism, aka state capitalism (ala Nazi Germany and contemporary China), is an outlier— *no* earthly idea why it works so well. Nevertheless, I think it's plainly obvious that command economies lead to stagnation. There is no better evidence of this than [Ancient Egypt](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/economy/][)— they gave us some nice wonders, such as the [10,000 year old Sphinx]( http://www.ancient.eu/article/236/][) and the Great Pyramids, amongst other things. However, ever since their civilization began ~5,000 BC, up to the empire's fall around 100 AD, there was virtually *no* progress. Egypt is called the most conservative civilization in history for a reason— you don't just *not change* for 5,000 years. 

Feudal/theocratic Europe? Things only got done due to commissions. The theocratic middle East today? They would be medieval if it weren't for global trade (and they're still medieval in thought, to be honest). 

Cuba, North Korea, these types of nations never seem to move past the 1950s— when their authoritarian socialist models were put in place. If anything, North Korea seems to be *regressing*, ala *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and INGSOC's point of power for the sake of power. Meanwhile, Cuba is beginning to move forward. A market economy (no doubt to be market socialism in the coming years) will advance their economy and technological development.

Now don't get me wrong. When you get something like the Gilded Age, where 1% of people control <95% of a nation's wealth, you might as well have authoritarianism or feudalism. Of course, maybe that's when national socialism becomes most useful.

So let's see something here: why does capitalism beget technological innovation? In capitalism, the aim is to make money. Anything else is just a distraction or moralizing. The more capital you accumulate, the more successful you become in society. The more influence you wield. Thus, it is paramount that you find a way to maximize the accumulation of capital using the minimum amount of effort. Doing it the ""hard way"" is for losers who don't understand the plot and honestly believe sweat = money. It doesn't.

A secular free market is the best way to push technology forward. We've tried other methods, and boy have they failed. That's not to say there aren't other successful methods— market socialism, national socialism, those kinds. The faster, more efficient methods of making money succeed. And so on. And so on. And so forth. The more you can do with less, the better.

You see where I'm going with this, right? At some point, even using humans to work becomes too expensive. Paying workers is expensive and eats away profits. However, how else are you going to get a working class to make your products, or a middle class to buy your products? You can't do it all by yourself. Hence you get socialist ideologies— is it fair that one person or a board of directors profit more than the workers who actually make the product? That's hotly debated, and I won't get into that.

There must be a better way, right? A way to create products for as little cost as possible, maximize profits as much as possible, with as few workers as possible. If capitalism has worked at all (and it *usually *does), there will be computers. Calculating machines capable of crunching numbers with far greater efficiency than us wetware apes.

What capitalism needs is for those computers to become intelligent and start doing physical and mental labor.

What happens when they do? Two things can happen. Capitalism either breaks down, or it evolves.

#Capitalism Breaks Down

This is easy to do, and there are many ways to do it.

* Try to prolong old-school capitalism by regulating away the AI and droids. Wind up creating authoritarian socialism or even totalitarian theocracy (as I believe the extreme right in USica would be apt to do)

* The Parable of the Capitalist. Capitalism collapses entirely because capitalists refuse to issue a basic income/basic dividend. Thus, the working and middle classes have no means of income. They won't take this lightly. At the same time, capitalists will lose money thanks to no one buying products with money they don't have. There will become two tiers of capitalists: those wealthy and powerful enough who use the droids to produce things for them only, and those who don't have enough power to do so and fast become paupers. 99.99% of the world won't take death so easily, so the only logical way for the wealthy few to deal with this is to nuke the world. Not like they'll survive the 'caust either.

* Basic income. This only breeds neo-feudalism of a *Brave New World* or *Time Machine* sort. Basic income sounds like a great way to quell unrest and grant the proles a bit of relaxation? Yeah, well think long-term. The wealthy who pay for the UBI will just find ways to reduce it to a point where it's just enough to keep the underclass happy, but not enough to introduce them into the *real* future world, with all the high-tech goodies we salivate over. Thus, you get the ""Two Class Species"" scenario. One beautiful, eternally wealthy ruling class who actually profits from droid labor; one ugly, degenerate underclass who's only afforded the scraps left over.

* Keep neoliberalism propped up with BS jobs that clearly don't have to be done. Yuck.

* Kill off the poor. This just leads to Technostism (With Fewer People), unless the rich are psychotic insanes who *want* to die (which, trust me, seems to be the case sometimes).

* Kill off the rich. Who knows what this leads to. I'd imagine that the poor hold intense animosity towards the droids that almost got them killed.

#Capitalism Evolves

* Technostism.

I'm not even kidding, this is it. We either move into technostism or we fall into one of the above. Quite frankly, I don't know what to call it with previous terms. Anarcho-syndicalism? Neoliberalist capitalism meets anarchocommunism meets libertarian transhumanism? Techno-anarchism? Resource-based economy? None of them describe it well at all. Hence why I created the term. Take the best aspects of capitalism and fuse it with the best aspects of socialism. Free markets, social equality, economic equality, all that jazz. It's impossible today because we don't have an automated economy. In fact, to a non-technostist, a lot of things sound contradictory. Economic equality with economic freedom? You mean everyone earns the same, but there are no taxes or state force? W. T. F.?! Well let me explain: everyone doesn't earn the same for equal work. Actually, technostism is probably what creates a ""level playing field"" more than anything. But first, let's kill off that nasty word, ""work."" There is no ""work."" Not unless you want to work. Any work I'm willing to put in won't matter because robots can always do it better. Still, is that a reason to not work? That's like saying ""My older brother can write better novels than me, so I'm not going to write ever."" The reason for my hatred of hard work is nil; I do not hate hard work. I hate *meaningless busy work*. It’s like a brutal assignment for a 300 page novel I have to write in one month, one that if I do manage to complete, I will feel accomplished for having done, as opposed to 300 pages of ELA problems that rarely amount to more than “Is ‘be’ a verb or a noun?” hidden within a frustratingly confusing maze of 6th grade word problems. It's just as useless as laziness. Yet this is what our culture thrives upon: the richest people are those that tended to follow their dreams to the bitter end; the masses never get that option because they're too busy wasting their time working at dead end jobs they never wanted. There are exceptions, but it's noted that they are exceptions.
 
Technostism is the end of busy work for the sake of busy work. Indeed, those are the jobs that will go first. The “essential” jobs. Those that require little training or experience, but a lot of man hours. There go your cashiers, your garbage men, your mailmen, fast food cooks, etc. Afterwards will be the white collar jobs and then the thought-heavy and human-centric jobs.

Our reaction to this change as well as transhumanism and artificial intelligence during this time will be the decisive factor as to whether we make it to advanced stage technostism or face full fledged societal collapse (aka Meeting the Great Filter).

So the communist aspects— we all own droids, and we earn the fruits of what we do, no more and no less. There is social equality, Orwell's Heaven and exactly what Blair argued for in *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (which depicts a timeline where the ruling elite forcibly maintains scarcity and destroys any attempt to raise the standard of living for the masses in order to keep class distinctions and power intact).

The capitalist aspects— we all become capitalists. The Marxist perspective of history says that there are two classes: the exploiter class, ""bourgeoisie,"" and the exploited, ""proletariat."" There are other classes, but those are the most important. Socialism sees to it that all people become the proletariat. Technostism sees to it that all people become the bourgeoisie. The droids are the proles.

We've seen how successful capitalism is for capitalists. Spread that around, make everyone capitalists in that sense. Communism for capitalists. Or capitalism for communists. Except not really.

It's clearly not ""capitalism"", especially since capitalism is a Marxist term. It's technostism. It's capitalism, evolved. Like transcapitalism. Socialism, communism, those fun things? Those were like prosthetics, and Karl Marx and co. were imagining transhumanism and augmentation culture during a time when it wasn't even close to being feasible, yet still doing their damndest to make it a reality.

#The Metastate

Communism and technostism ultimately merge upon reaching the automation saturation point— the point where one profits from droid labor, rather than their own. The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens² are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog— so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/Technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol.

* **A**stronomic

* **D**eep

* **E**arth

* **M**ining
We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane— all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust— all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism— those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations— not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica. No more networking class. No more nanofabrication. No more AI.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.***

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions— and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate (one reason why I call humans the ""networking class."")

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design. There's no doubt that slavery could be a great thing— if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor thanks to slaves.

Tell me, if I start a business— a large business— I need workers, correct? Technostism says ""the working class is made up of machines."" This isn't force— technostism only works when the machine working class is as cheap and as capable as a human working class. Then cheaper, and far more capable. If you're desperate to lose money, then using a human working class is always there, providing anyone actually chooses such.
Unravel it from there. Using free market ideals, work out the economy.

Wealth divides will still exist, just like in Athens's ruling class. Some people won't do anything with themselves— that's just us. Many people would love to be lazy. Being lazy on another's dime pisses off many people. Imagine you're a lower middle class modern day serf bringing home $500 a week, and learning $250 of your paycheck is going to a lazy fatass who's never worked a day in his life so he can play World of Warcraft on a sweet high-end Alienware machine that costs more than you make in half a year. You're gonna want to hunt down that motherfucker and put two barrels through his skull. But what if that fatass had a harem of sexy robots bringing in a steady flow of cash? Would you care anywhere near as much? No, because none of your money is going to fund him. You might feel a bit upset that he's making more in a day than you do in a week and doesn't have to lift a finger (save for the game), but in that case, you're in the wrong. Just buy your own droids. Stop being envious.

#The Parable of the Capitalists

I mentioned this earlier. There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executives and shareholders of the human-labor business sees the profits the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off their workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, everyone is standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second business was getting rich off the paychecks of the first business's workers. When the first business fired their workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a global scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will never become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction. This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will not create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do. They're fallacy-proof.

#Crushing The STEM Fallacy

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. 

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is human-level AI possible? It happened once before— humans ourselves. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
