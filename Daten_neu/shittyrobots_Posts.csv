"Robot Riot - Drunken, Shitty Robot FightingHey ya'll,

I've just launched Robot Riot's Youtube channel and I've started to upload footage from our previous competitions. I've started with matches from Round 1 of our second competition, Super Robot Riot Turbo II. [Check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdO7QQ3NYu-JvdaJm4V7H8kXvRk3UY4Hh). 

Robot Riot is the backyard wrestling of robot fighting. Based on [Hebocon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ivFpsmEVQ), Robot Riot hunts down amateurs and teaches them how to build robots at weekly bar meetups. Fighting consists of robot sumo and winners are decided by crowd cheers or complete destruction of your opponent. All pilots must do a shot before each match. Robot builders can also agree to grudge matches where the loser must destroy their own robot.

This competition features a knife spider, a Rick and Morty butter bot, and other dumb shit.

I'll start releasing footage of each round on a weekly basis and repeat this for every competition we've held. 

Let me know what you think! **AnD bE sUrE tO LiKe, FaVoRiTe, AnD sUbScRiBe Ayoooooo** /ObnoxiousGameStreamerVoice"

"Where does one start their Shitty Robot journey?So, I'm still green to the robotics industry and did an industry shift to get here. I know how to program in oython and C++, I'm comfortable soldering and with electronics, and I can draft and have my own 3d printer.

I'm thankful for the opportunities I've had and want to expand my skills. I also want to hage a bunch of shitty bots in my home and to build up my pratical skills (primarily in programming and working with electronics).
Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on where to start and how to get my journey in bot building going?"

"What is a shitty robot? [Meta]Is an ""intentionally shitty"" robot really shitty? It seems to me that the answer to this question can't be yes, as it performed as intended.

Is an intentionally shitty robot awesome? Well they don't inspire awe, as the engineering skill required is small. So, it seems once again that the answer cannot be yes. 

So I have to wonder, if it's neither awesome nor shitty, how does that sort of robot fit into this sub? "
"Hebocon World Cup 2016: Who will answer its siren's call?Hey all, 

Hebocon, a crappy robot competition that started in Japan, will be hosting a [World Cup in Japan on August 7th during the Tokyo Maker Faire](https://www.facebook.com/Hebocon.Official/?ref=br_rs&fref=nf). I run a similar competition in the US, Robot Riot, and I know that there are several US Hebocons. I also know there are a number of pretty successful Hebocons being hosted outside the US and Japan. Does anyone know if any countries will be sending representatives to Japan for the competition?  I'm contemplating forming a posse from the US to collectively compete in this...

I will be hosting a [Hebocon-style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ivFpsmEVQ) robot fighting competition at Geek Bar in Chicago on December 9th! The technical limitations aren't as restrictive as a typical Hebocon's but rest assured this will be the Wrestlemania of robotics. Trophies, free booze, and glory await the victors. 

Entry is free but make sure to try out Geek Bar's awesome menu.

[Check out the Facebook event.](https://www.facebook.com/events/460165690858356/) Keep an eye out for an announcement for our January 23rd event at Gaming Under the Influence!

Interested in building a robot and competing? Email RobotRiotCompetition@gmail.com for details. Geek Bar, Robot City Workshop, and myself hold weekly meetings to help amateur builders make their dream machines so don't worry about a lack of technical experience!

I'll be sure to return here with a video of the matches."

"Our Sub and the RedesignAs some of you may have noticed, there is heavy controversy regarding the redesign. Among the talking points are flair limitations, CSS limitations, and having to moderate both the legacy and redesign versions of individual subreddits. All these issues will impact us. At ShittyRobots we strive for a fun, unique community experience; we do not want to lose that. We will temporarily be disabling our CSS in the hopes that the admins will take note of how much subs like our own rely on the customization tools that will be lost to the redesign.

EDIT: It has started. They really lack proper comments, and they have no sound at all mostly. The viewers would really love to hear at least their engines working or something. Also they fucked up the sound channels and when I hear sound it's just one channel in my stereo, second channel stays silent. Really hurts you if you wear headphones.

One of the bots has stuck in the sand. Looks hilarious so far.
