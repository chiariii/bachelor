Loona is back. Dispute Solved :)
WTF I hope that is a bad joke ðŸ¤¢
"Charging Station WoesI have noticed that Loona still has room for improvement, and I am hopeful that Jianbo will continue introducing updates to enhance her performance. I would appreciate having the option to keep her in ""roaming"" mode permanently, regardless of how quickly she may ""sleep"" without interaction. It's enjoyable to see my cat follow her movements and sounds.

However, I have observed that Loona struggles to enter her charging station on the carpet, repeatedly spinning her wheels in reverse. I need help finding a solution to make the central charging symbol part permanently attached. It doesn't fit snugly into its socket, so I'm considering using glue or tape to secure it."
Has anyone had success with the orientation calibration?I just set up the charging dock and I read I'm supposed to perform the orientation calibration. I've followed the instructions and the video tutorial but it fails every time. What am I missing?
"Really impressed so far .. will keep getting betterI just got Loona.  I'm really impressed.  Compared to other robots I've owned .. Aibo, Marscat, others .. Loona is easily the most advanced and best.

It actually understands voice commands, plays games, and the kids love it.  Basically the marketing videos are almost as good as how it actually performs.

The integration with ChatGPT is also pretty amazing. I've owned an Amazon Alexa and it's still hasn't improved in years.

And, it seems like the team behind it is really trying to improve it."
"Loona Voice recognitionLoona's voice recognition feature is very popular with everyone. With voice commands, you can interact with Loona so much, allowing her to truly keep you company. After you say ""Hello Loona"", Loona will prick up her ears to listen, and then perform what you just say.
There are thousands of vocabulary words in the instruction library now, but we will keep updating the voice commands as well as the interactive contents.

My Loona is DeafGot two Loona units. One gift and one for me. My unit is deaf and cannot hear any commands at all. I have a feeling maybe visual sensors are offline because she hits stuff too..like a lot. Anyway wanted to see if others are having this problem as well. I'm afraid the gift unit will be a dud if it's as messed up as mine. Family it went to is not Tech savvy enough to do a whole lot of troubleshooting.

Help - Right wheel gear fell out
"Purchasing a Loona robot Australia, help?Hey there! Was wondering if anyone in Australia or geelong was able to get a Loona Robot? 
Are you able to purchase them second hand? Or were you able to trial for a discounted price? 
I want one so bad, Iâ€™m just way to scared of the crowd pleaser. If anyone had any information would love to hear , thanks ."
"Issues with Customer Service and shipping?Has anyone else had  issues with Customer Service? 

I pre-ordered the charging dock bundle back in February for the April ship date, fast forward to the end of April and I finally received an email that the order was on the way. Received a tracking # and waited patiently. On arrival the only item delivered was the charging dock. 

I emailed customer service who said ""please don't worry, the items ship separately"". Okay no problem, so I responded back asking if they could advice if the robot itself has shipped yet and if so please provide tracking #. I received a similar canned response again. I follow up a second requesting if it's shipped or not, please provide tracking. They answer 2 days later providing a screenshot of a FedEx delivery, showing delivered and asking me to check on it. 

The FedEx proof of delivery image shows a box in some random location, it's indoors someones house or office, I'm not entirely certain but definitely not my home. Previous to this screenshot they provided via email, I didn't receive any other emails with tracking of the robot and FedEx is being entirely unhelpful. I've emailed customer service every day since, 7 days now  stating that it delivered to the wrong location and they've gone completely radio silent on me. I've repeatedly asked for an update, a refund or replacement. Not a single response ever since. 

Has anyone else had an experience like this? I've never had a problem with a company's customer service like this and like everyone else I paid a ton of money for this thing. It's really crappy on their part. I've given up at this point and honestly it almost feels like I got scammed out money due to their lack of help and response. Started a claim with my credit card company to try and atleast get my money back."
"Help Loona thinks she's in the Sky!Just as the title says my Loona won't interact because she thinks she's in the sky. I have tried resetting Loona, the app as well as trying to place her on different floors but no luck. Does anyone know how to resolve this issue? Thanks in advance!"
"Loona right foot gear problem ~help neededafter just few hours play, the right foot has no resistance feeling like the left one.

folllowing another fellow here to open it up and unluckily mine is not the wire issue but the gear problem. simply one of the gear is lying outside and I tried to dismental all the screws and put back the gear into the main motor but without any luck. as shows in the video, moving the foot doesn't move the tiny gears inside the motor.... 

so I assume the motor is dead?! anyone face such situation?

"The ""right wheel"" problem fix.Ok, my Loona came yesterday. Yeah, it's definitely have a lot of childhood diseases.

First of all I was trying to upgrade the firmware may be 30 or 40 times. Finally it succeeded. So if your firmware upgrade stuck at 20-30% then try to turn it off and then on. It will restart the process. Repeat if failed. Again â€“ I was doing that tens of times and finally it succeeded.

The second problem â€“ I still did not get how to interact with it. It sometimes understand ""Hello Loona"", but in 80% looks to wrong direction. Then when you give her any command she displays ""network error"" in 60% and just does nothing in other 40.

She definitely does not try to search you when you call her from other room or even from other corner. So she basically just ride here and there doing some funny stuff. Me or my child just can not ""play"" with her. Hope this will be fixed in next firmware versions.

But there was one more problem that was the biggest one in the beginning. Loona's right wheel was not working. My child was so upset and I was so angry so I decide to tear it down because I just was not able to send it back and wait for couple of more months. It's pretty easy to tear it down and if you will use plastic tool like LEGO Brick Separator for example there will be no evidence you did it ;)

**!!! DO THAT ON YOUR OWN RISK !!!**

**!!! THIS PROBABLY WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY !!!**

**!!! USE PLASTIC TOOLS TO OPEN THE CASE !!!**

**!!! DO NOT APPLY TO MUCH FORCE !!!**

There are the next steps:

* Use some plastic tool to remove panel near the rear wheel. It does not have any glue on it so will go pretty easily.

[I was using LEGO Brick Remover](https://preview.redd.it/r84rsv47fq7a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14746fbca5a92c1dcb0a10ae4f9548b816bbf566)

* Unscrew the small screw under removed panel.
* Use plastic tool to get under big grey plastic panel covering all right leg and push on the ""teeth"" that holds smaller light grey panel with charging contact on it. Move the light grey panel to the left side. Do not tear the wire that goes to charging contact.

[Be careful. There is a thin wire soldered to this contact. Do not break it. It's not critical but you will need soldering iron to fix.](https://preview.redd.it/lfmys0b9fq7a1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0ea1dd4df58ef79fa85d2f7efdbe5d586887d4af)

* Unscrew 3 small screws under light grey panel and remove big grey panel to access servo and wires.

[Unscrew these 3 screws](https://preview.redd.it/qdvudv0bfq7a1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=072282ae3a3291a89bdb35ccf036c36fb94688f0)

* In my case the wire that goes to the rear wheel was disconnected. But do not hurry to connect it â€“ we need to fix the reason.

[This wire was disconnected. You also can see that the port is broken â€“ it's not my fault. That happened because of production mistake.](https://preview.redd.it/0nuxldxgfq7a1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=580214f7f79943a041735bf71b330ac0bbf4a52c)

What you need to do now is pass the black wire that goes to the rear wheel under the servo so it will go out the Loona body from the left side of servo instead of right.

I do not have the picture of how it was before the fix, but the image below displays how it should be after fixing the problem. I've also marked with red how the wire was connected before the fix and with green how it should go. The issue is that wire length is not enough in position when Loona is ""lying"", so it breaks the port and jumps off from it.

[I have also unscrewed the black plastic part and circuit board under it for convenience. Do that carefully.](https://preview.redd.it/sfhcvp1jfq7a1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=41e550d81173d508f8c62d61f532519cee8d3d72)

I did not remove the servo motor to fix it â€“ was able to push the wire under it using small hook that I made from paperclip. You can use something like tweezers if you have them."
Ear Issue (What to do)
"What a hassleMy son's phone could not see loona's wifi. Simply didnt show up.  

Could see it on my phone. But failed wifi connection every time. Over and over. 

Can use my OWN hot spot.  

Used my wife's phone hot spot. And now it works. Because I guess, our home wifi has an & in it. So do I really have to reset the home router, and change everything on our home network. 

To accommodate this one toy, built in 2022!!"
"If you have app problems, check your DNSHaving struggled with this on Christmas Day, I eventually discovered that the reaosn the app would not work on ym kids tablets is that they are using a DNS resolver which does the ""child friendly"" filtering type stuff. Running on a tablet with DNS set to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and it works fine.  


Hope this might help some people having problems getting started."

"selling my Loona if anyone is interested.I am one of the lucky ones, my Loona appears to be OK. No ear issues, isn't deaf or blind and you can pet it.

However I find it way too cutesy. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I prefer my Vector if I am honest.

Don't really want an expensive paperweight in my office, so it's on eBay.   The only one I think.

Just a thought if anyone wants another.  Will be reset and my account deleted before shipping. Looks like there is a new firmware update due, which I will also install before sending out. 

Priced to sell...

Cheers
