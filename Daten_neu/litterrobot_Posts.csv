"I just got my litter robot 4 and have reset it a few times for incorrect weight. My 18lb cat does not weigh 6lbs (trust me, there are days I wish he did!!). Is there anything I‚Äôm doing incorrectly (or not doing ) in the reset or tare the scale?"
Cleaning / Maintenance recommendationsI‚Äôve been enjoying my new LR3 C since 5/5/23. Am going away early June. Looking to ensure solid functioning and simply maintain appropriately. I searched on Reddit and found no posts. I trust your expertise! Any links or bullets much appreciated!! üíñüêà‚Äç‚¨õ
Can LR4 with one cat be left unattended for a week?I currently use the PetSafe Scoopfree. The price of the replacement litter trays is making this no longer cost effective. I've been looking at the LR4 but I need something I can leave for a week at a time and trust to work without supervision. I see several reviews saying that the sensors get dusty and can cause frequent issues. Is this really as bad as it sounds? Is anyone able to let the LR4 run for a week without any attention? I just have one cat so I don't expect it to have to be emptied sooner than a week. Thanks!
"How to get your litter robot set up for success.This is my third litter robot, brand new, model 3 without Wi-Fi. One is working just fine, and the other needs some parts.

To be honest, I've taken my robots for granted for a while now. With too many cats using one, it can get pretty messy. So here's my question: how can I set up a new litter robot for success? Specifically, is there a way to disable some of the sensors without losing any of the functionality?

As you may have guessed, it's that weird sensor that always seems to get covered in cat litter during the cleaning cycle. Any ideas or advice?""

Edit+  just a quick reminder to myself: don't go overboard with the cleaning liquids on the metal part of the litter robot. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!"""
"Is 24 hour sleep mode possible?My cats are still getting to know our LR -- three cats, we've had it two weeks, and today for the first time one of them used it. It's been off all that time, except when I did a manual cycle. No one seems terrified of it, which is great, because two of them are very skittish.

I'd like to be able to leave it on, so that I can tell if cats are checking it out even if they don't use it, and so I know sooner if they do use it (or at least may have used it), but I definitely don't want to accidentally spook any of them before they're all using it regularly. 

I see that in the app I can set Sleep Mode to run from 12am to 12am both weekdays and weekends, now, but has anyone actually ***done*** this? I'm worried it might end up reading that time as no time rather than 24 hours, or that it might run itself once at 12am every night with that setup. Usually, I'd just test something like that by doing it, but like I said... I'm pretty worried about spooking one or more of them out of trying and trusting it."

"LR4: Massive waste of money and timeI‚Äôm fed up with this machine after 5 months. I spend far more time dealing with it than we ever did with a regular litter box. On top of that, because we are supposed to trust it to do its job and it doesn‚Äôt, the cat ends up peeing elsewhere in the house. The design was a neat idea and if this was a manual crank to dump the litter in the box for about 20% of the price, it would be great. We‚Äôve fully cleaned it several times, checked sensors, etc and it never works right. 

Constant faults, being stuck in the emptying position, bonnet comes loose and there‚Äôs a gap between it and the ring, misreads on how full the bin is even when fully empty, more faults or stopping for no reason‚Ä¶ every single damn day it‚Äôs something. 

This POS shouldn‚Äôt be in production."
"I regret getting a litter robot.I've had a litter robot 3 for a month now, and I gotta say.. It sucks. The cats use it just fine, but it feels like the stupid thing gets stuck every other day, and half the time the cats' waste gets stuck on the inside of the wall and it touches their fur when they are trying to use it (and even the stuff that gets dropped in the bin still leaves smears of wet urine or cat shit on the inside walls).. I've tried several kinds of clumping clay cat litter, all with the same results. Frankly though, the fact the thing gets stuck and just sits there with flashing yellow lights is irritating as hell. Can't trust the damn thing. What happens if we leave on a trip or something? The litter box will just get stuck and the cats won't have a place to shit for a few days, right? I actually regret getting rid of my old regular litter boxes. Only consolation is that it was a gift, and I didn't pay for it."
I wouldn‚Äôt be rushing to update and calibrate LR4 - mine shows 40% full afterwards with bag emptySubject line says it all. The calibration was a waste of time.
"LR3 Connect Sensor being weirdHey, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the app side of things that are being funky or the LR3 itself so I need someone to kinda help me troubleshoot. 

I‚Äôve had it for 10 months or so and have two cats. I‚Äôve not really changed the litter types at all and used to be able to go 4 days or so without having to change the waste bag. 

I changed it on Friday and by Saturday night/Sunday morning the app was already saying it was full. Sunday afternoon I took it apart, knocked off any loose litter on the inside by the sensor and even cleaned it off with isopropyl alcohol. I got home from work about an hour ago and checked the app and it already says 94%. Visually, it‚Äôs definitely not nearly that full and shaking it to ‚Äúlevel out‚Äù the waste doesn‚Äôt help much either. 

Also, I just reset the app gauge and manually cycled and it now says 6%. I didn‚Äôt remove the litter. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. I‚Äôve turned it off and on again, I‚Äôve taken it apart and cleaned it, I‚Äôve reset the app itself, I‚Äôve checked to make sure the bag is under the drawer line, and I‚Äôve cleaned the sensor off with isopropyl alcohol. I‚Äôm not sure what to try next."
Stubborn Cat Finally Using LR4We have had the litter robot for about a month now and we're struggling getting one of our cats to use it. She finally started to use it consistently after we made a small  platform around the level of the step for her to jump on to get into the litter robot. Hopefully this helps anyone else with a stubborn cat.
"Success! My cats are both using it, here‚Äôs what helped.So happy my cats are using their LR4 and so far, so good. I figured I‚Äôd share what seemed to help. I have two cats, both are 10 y/o. One is a very confident male and the other is a skittish female. Both are not too picky about their litter box or type of litter, but can be a bit intimidated by electronics that move and make sound. This is their very first experience with any sort of electronic/self cleaning cat box. 

Day 1 - I did not set up LR4 in the same place as their normal litter box, because I just wanted them to get used to LR4 being in the home first. This is a bit different from LR‚Äôs advice, however it worked very well for me. I wanted them to still have their old litter box available for use, in its normal spot. This way it wouldn‚Äôt be too overwhelming for them. I hadn‚Äôt added litter into LR yet or turned LR on. Both cats just treated LR like it was a new piece of furniture. They liked the shipping box it came in more then the actual LR. 

Day 2 - Added litter and turned the LR on. Both cats seemed startled by LR rotating and making noise. This is the point at which they started having trust issues with LR. They would keep somewhat of a distance from LR and keep turning their heads to watch what LR was up to. 

Day 3 - started giving treats around LR. Even placed treats on the step and scatter shield. Was generous with petting when they took the treats from LR‚Äôs area. I had to be patient at this point and sit with them in front of LR for awhile. Would give pets throughout the rest of the day when they went close to LR. By the end of the day, I had removed some waste from their old litter box, and placed it into LR. I wanted them to go by smell to know it was a litter box. 

Day 4 - Success! My first cat (non-skittish one) used the LR successfully.  Saw him go to it multiple times in the first day. 

Day 5 - Success again. Second cat (skittish one) now using LR. 

So not too bad. Took 5 days for both cats. A little patience goes a long way. I also recommend keeping it on the 15 or 30 min. cycle, at least until your cats adjust. My next step is to get rid of the old box and place LR there instead. Im not too worried about this step since they are already comfortable with LR."

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought a Litter Robot 3 on in December 2019, along with a 3-year warranty. A couple of months ago my litter robot developed a problem ‚Äì it consistently got stuck halfway while cycling.

When it is stuck, I can solve it by pressing the ‚Äúoff‚Äù and ‚Äúon‚Äù buttons, unplugging the power, or moving the robot a bit; then it will continue to cycle through. But now it is getting worse ‚Äì it is stuck 2-3 times during 1 cycle, so now it becomes burdensome.

**My 1st attempt** to contact [support@whisker.com](mailto:support@whisker.com) was on 9/21/2022. I sent an email with order number, purchase date and warranty information. I received no responses. **Case #00983949**

**2nd attempt** was on 9/27/2022. Received no responses. **Case #00995076**

**4th attempt** was on 10/4/2022. No response. **#01000615**

Before I post my experience on other social media, I am going to wait a few days to see if they will contact me. If not, trust me I am going to post my complaint everywhere online until I hear back from the company.

Honestly, I am very happy with my robot. I was considering buying a Litter Robot 4 for my 2nd floor. But this really ruined my experience, especially since I purchased a warranty with it.

New buyers be aware"
"Bought LR3 and I regret it. It feels I spend more time troubleshooting it than when I was scooping litter from the litter box.I got the L3 last Saturday and within the first week, it‚Äôs been nothing but trouble. I thought my issues would be training my 2 cats to use them but they started using it the next day. Day 1 was fine but as soon as Day 2, cycling was interrupted 2 times. Checked everything - mat in the front, LR3 not close to the wall, etc. Day 3 and Day 4, mid cycle interruptions again. And each time I get this notification, I have to turn the power off and then on. Day 5, the cycle was interrupted again as expected, but this time LR3 shows offline in the app after turning it on. I followed the troubleshooting guide but it didn‚Äôt help so now I don‚Äôt get notification when it stops mid cycle. Since I don‚Äôt trust LR3 not stopping mid cycle, I have to keep checking it when I‚Äôm at home and when I‚Äôm at work, I worry that my cats would end up doing the deeds somewhere in the house (or hold their pee). 

This is really frustrating. I‚Äôm experiencing issues within days after purchasing it. More so for something I paid more than $500 for and can‚Äôt get customer service to help. I can‚Äôt get someone on the phone now because of apparently unprecedented level of demand for LR4, their phones are unavailable. 

I never posted a negative review in my whole life. But today, I need somewhere to rant. And if any of you have suggestions to fix it or a better option for me, I would be grateful."
"LR3 Connect Constant Cycle InterruptionsI just purchased the LR3 Connect last week.  Within the first 24 hours, the unit began having ""cycle interrupted"" errors every single time it cycled.  Resetting the power manually resolves the issue, but it's gotten to the point now where I have to leave it off during the day and cycle manually each night because when it gets stuck there is no litter for my kitties.

Ive checked my litter levels, and its either at or below the fill line.  My LR3 is also level (it has a little unlevelness to it when it cycles due to the litter shifting).  I also dont see any obstructions anywhere.

Has anyone else experienced this and have a resolution?  I absolutely LOVE it when it works, but I cant trust it to work when Im not home to monitor it."
"Not happy with LRConnect software - they need to work on this.I‚Äôve been really happy with the litter robot for a while, but lately the software side of the connect is just not working correctly and so I can‚Äôt actually use it as an automatic box. One of our cats will occasionally watch it cycle and put her paws on the edge, triggering an over torque fault. Previously I could use my app to turn the box off and back on, which would continue the cycle and be fine. Now if I turn the robot off via the app, the app will no longer update until I physically press the reset button on the base. Even though I‚Äôve tested it and it does come back on via my app command, the app continues to just say ‚Äúoff‚Äù. So now I can‚Äôt trust the box when I‚Äôm not home. What‚Äôs the point of the remote app if it requires you to be standing there beside the unit? This is just the latest in a string of weird software issues - such as the cycle count being way off and resetting randomly. I‚Äôve tried everything. 

The product itself is fine, but they need some real help in IT."
"Don‚Äôt give up!! (Also fat cat friendly)Some tricks for anyone feeling the dread of maybe returning the LR. Be patient!! Obviously this won‚Äôt work for everyone, but it worked for us. 

1. Use a mixture of litter attractant and dirty litter from previous box. 
2. Cat nip spray. Buy it at Walmart. It helps the box seem more appealing 
3. After a few days, calmly place cats in LR and reassure them with lots of treats. Obviously don‚Äôt force them if they are scared. Give them a lot of reassurance. 
4. Let the old litter box get nasty. 
5. If they still use the old box when it‚Äôs nasty, go cold turkey! I was so worried about doing the cold turkey method but it worked out just fine. 
6. I‚Äôm waiting another week before I let them see a cycle, but they have heard the noises from me manually cycling it. 

Hope this helps! 

ALSO if anyone has a 22 pound cat, don‚Äôt worry... they fit lmao I bought the ramp for her though. 

Another trick I forgot to mention is cat grass! You can buy it at pet stores or Walmart too. It grows within a few days and cats love it. I placed it next to the LR and they started hanging out next to it a lot. 

Don‚Äôt give up! Be patient. This thing is amazing and worth the patience. Trust the process and read up on it."
"Please fix Sleep mode!The litter robot when on sleep timer just will come on no matter what at that time. A cat can be in the litter robot and the thing just runs a cycle! The timer should still take priority, I had a cat in the robot when the wake up time started....

I've used it for awhile (the sleep timer) but never encountered what I woke up to today. The robot wakes up at 6:15am and cycles. Never thought to much about it, kind of a alarm lol. Anyway this morning I woke up before 6am and was just chilling in bed till around 6:14am, when one of my cats decided it was time to go #2. The robot woke up, started cycling while she was finishing and she had to hop out while cleaning started. 

Luckily she trusts me and has sense went back in to finish up, but its a problem, no? 

The timer should let the go button know not to run or something??? I mean if it was #1 it would be a horrible clean up event at least 1st thing when waking up. Also she could of got hurt if she was older and not able to get out of the way. That would of really ruined my life for awhile....

Anyway should be a easy fix to have the timer run when sleep timer is run I think? I won't be using this (sleep timer) till its fixed though after this event. Really have it go from not on to back to sensor at least but more complicated would be to always run the cat presence senor as a priority with the timer. 

Thanks and for everyone else I'd suggest leaving the sleep timer off till this is fix"
"LR3 reliability - at sh*t's endIt seems on a weekly basis I get both a pinch sensor and bonnet alert. Everytime I do the LR suggest led fix for both but after a few days of working without issue, these things still pop up! I just want the LR to go one week without any error messages.

I'm sick and tired of this! For several hundreds of dollars we paid for this piece of machinery the reliability is awful. How Whisker thought it would be a good idea to bring this (which is the 3rd generation, obviously) to market is mind boggling.

I have no interest in paying $85 for a new bonnet and whatever part to fix the pinch error. I just want to drive the LR to a field and go Office Space on it.

For those who bought the LR4, is it any better?"
"Reliable automated litterbox options available in the EU?I've been waiting for months for the LR4 to release Iin Europe, but it seems there's no fixed date yet. I just spoke with customer service and they think early 2023 is a good estimate but can't make promises. 

Two major reasons we waited for the LR4 instead of buying the LR3 is the larger opening (our cats seem to prefer that) and the larger waste bin (since we have three cats and it'd fill up quickly otherwise).

I'd rather not wait a whole lot longer, since we're dealing with some stuff that's making it difficult for us to stay on top of the litterbox situation. At the same time, it's a big purchase, and I don't want to end up regretting it in a year and either needing to stick with an unsatisfactory product or buying the LR4 anyway.

With that in mind, I wanted to see what people might recommend. Waiting for LR4? Going with the LR3 anyway? Another brand? A number of the litterbox alternatives I see mentioned here, like Leo's Loo Too, aren't available in Europe, so I thought an EU-specific thread might be handy."
"Best auto litter box for larger cat?I've been considering...

* PETKIT PuraMax
* Litter Robot 3 (4 is too expensive for me)
* PetSafe ScoopFree Complete Plus

My primary needs are..

* Decent space for my larger cat \~15 lbs (I'd really like him to be comfortable if I'm spending all this money)
* Good  odor control for my smaller apartment (I don't mind something I have to  clean weekly, but I like the auto-scooping especially when  entertaining)

Other considerations...

* The PetSafe box is a lot cheaper up front, but the others may justify their price over time with cheaper litter?
* Something that's relatively quiet would be nice
* I generally choose reliability over extra features and sensors. Smart Home connection is neat, but not necessary.

Thanks in advance!"
"LR3 ""cat sensor"" calibration or alternatives needed!This is an over-designed and under-engineered design, and WAY overcomplicated for what it is doing.   


The simple switch method from the LR2 ""just worked"" and I guess that was too easy for the company, because the logic program in this new one is infuriating for no benefit in functionality. The pressure sensor has variable resistance, and it must be within a range (which I saw once on the internet and have been unable to relocate since) rather than being a simple switch again.   


If the resistance is too high or too low, the stupid thing just blinks at you and doesn't work at all. This is what happens when the sensor fails - ok, that's no big issue, it wore out. Doesn't matter that I have LR2 units that are easily 3 times as old still working without a single part replacement.... So I replace the sensor. And it works for about 2 days, then is blinking randomly and stopping the functions AGAIN in mid cycle! Try to adjust it - lighter tension. Fast yellow and no function. More tension - Again fast yellow and no function!   


Seriously. WTAF. This is NONSENSE. It is a dang switch! It reads ""more weight arrived"" and sets the timer, or it sits there waiting. It isn't ""weighing"" the cat in this design, and THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD BUY THE NEW ONE BECAUSE I DON'T NEED THAT ADDING TO THE COMPLEXITY! Seriously Whisker / Litter Robot.... Stay in your lane. We need a globe that detects the cat and sets the timer, LIKE IT USED TO BE, and then does the sifting for us. That's all!

Has anyone found a RELIABLE way to calibrate this, with actual metered resistance numbers? FYI: ""the length of the bolt"" is NOT IT. I've tried all those and all I get is blinkblinkblinkblink.... NO. There has to be another way."
"Litter robot 4 vs Leo's loo too early thoughtsLittle background on two cats I have :

I am new to automatic litter solution since my first 6 year old cat (Sphynx ) liked to use our toilet since she was 4 months old. I only started to appreciate how smart she is when we got another kitten which does not have the same level of intelligence. So after three attempts to train the new cat and finding shit all over my house I gave up. Here come robots.

Purchased Leo's loo too a month ago. Both of my cats started using it from the moment I turned it on. I was not concerned with the smart one since she obviously prefer sand over toilet seat. The new cat also is using it without any issues. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them take a shit and get notifications on it for some odd reason. More on that later. A month in on it, the core function of this robot works as advertised. I mean not a single snag. I have yet to clean it or change the litter in it. The weight function is spotty and not reliable enough to tell the difference between the two cats. They have 4 pound difference and I still can't really tell who went for it.  That's about it.  The only issue was that I had Leo's loo too on the second floor of my house and my cats had second litter box on the first floor. Solution was to get another toy for me and my cats. So obvious choice is to get the same Leos loo too robot and add it on my app. However, Robot 4 adds few more interesting features which Leo does not. I was still concerned about all the reported issues litter robot 4 users had with hardware and software. I still went for it given that Whisker has 90 days return policy and I can send it back.

So I ordered Litter robot 4. for those who are interested , Whisker (Litter -Robot 4 ) had 3-5 day shipping on their site at the time of the order. It ended up being 7 days till it was delivered.

Opened it up and went through the set up within few minutes. Both cats yet again took immediate interest and both relieved themselves in the orderly fashion. No burn in period at all. Both dropped the Duce right away.

I own Leos loo too for a month. I have Litter robot for few days.

Features which **Robot 4** has an upper leg on Leo's loo too:

A. Dumping old sand into the waist bin. This is a big one since you would have to drag Leo;s globe out and find creative way to get rid of the litter without making a mess. While setting up I had to dump clean litter and saw this feature worked perfectly. That's a win for Robot 4.

B. Bigger opening to get in and out - looks like they don't seem to mind jumping in smaller or bigger opening.

C. Waist bin level monitoring - so far it is showing accurate level. Leo's loo does not have that option.

Features which **Leo's loo too** has over Robot 4

UV light  - It is too early to tell how Robot 4 will perform in the smell department , but Leos loo too does not smell at all even with the full bin of waist. It actually smells like an expensive air freshener.  I don't know if it's a UV light that controls the oder so well or/and the design which isolates waist bin from the globe's opening. I mean I could have put it in the kitchen next to the dining table and still be happy with it. I will wait for a month and update this thread on the smell situation for Robot 4.

&#x200B;

Issues so far :

Leo's loo too - none

Robot 4  - as I took that thing out of the box and went through the first few cleaning cycles, I did face an issue with the hard clicking sound. Felt like a mechanical issue with the rotation mechanism. I was laughing that it had to happen on the first day given all the reviews I have read prior to ordering it.

Someone else had the same issue here : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV\_hVTHRw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV_hVTHRw)

So I did some quick research and it ended up being a small issue with the fence causing friction and coming into contact with the plastic piece on the globe while it is rotating during cleaning cycle. I posted my solution here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking\_sound\_when\_rotating\_lr\_4/jcqbxby/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking_sound_when_rotating_lr_4/jcqbxby/?context=3)

Not sure if it is a positive point, but robot 4 has ton of support discussions online. I feel like most of the issues will be easy to find and resolve them on your own. Not so much for Leo's loot too. I don't think Leo's loo too is just perfect and hence has no wide issues coverage online. It may be just a much newer product.

Missing function on both Robots: Email notification/ SMS

\- My boss made fun of me for buying robot and not scooping the old fashion way. He is usually on my case for buying too many tech gadgets. I only told him about one robot btw. So I have been taking screenshots of push notifications on my cat's bowel movement activity and sending it to him via text message. Wish there was an email/sms solution so I can automate this task.

I will update again in few months."
What features do you want to see added to the next generation of Litter Robot?
"I wish the feeder robot played a voice message like many other less expensive automated feeders do.As stated.   The feeder robot is the most reliable and best feeder we have owned and the app is great too. We especially like that we have one app for the LR4 and the Feeder bot, I just wish it played out voices to the cats when they are being fed."
"Litter Robot 4 not re-connecting to WifiHi everyone,

I have the LR4 and have an issue with the WiFI connection. Pretty frequently, it loses connection overnight. I have my router configured to reboot every night at something like 4-5am which helps with overall network stability, so I suspect that the LR4 is failing to reconnect when the reboot happens.

It's the only device on my network that has this issue, and this nightly reboot keeps my wireless network extremely reliable. I work from home, and prior to configuring things this way, my Wifi would occasionally go down during the workday (which always seemed to happen in meetings), so turning this reboot off isn't really an option.

Turning the LR off/on fixes the issue, but I generally don't notice this happens until the LR gets stuck upside down during a cleaning cycle and the cat has pooped on the floor.

I don't know that I'm expecting anyone here to have answers, but I'm wondering if anyone has run into this kind of issue and has a fix/workaround. I'm technically savvy, so have no issue doing some kind of manual configuration in my router if there's a solution.

I'm going to see if configuring the LR4 with a dedicated IP in my router does anything, but does anyone have any other suggestions?  


UPDATE:  
I've configured my LR4 to have a dedicated local IP in my router. Since doing this, it hasn't failed to reconnect.  


So if anyone finds themselves in the same situation and has the know-how to configure it, it is an option. "
"How much better are the later models than the 1st gen? Is the build quality better? I have 2x 1st gen LR's, and it seems like I'm always having to tinker to keep one or the other working reliably. I've had to replace multiple sensors, wiring looms, 1x motor, 1x circuit board.I compare the build quality of the non plastic parts to that of something made in someone's garage. I was very surprised how cheaply they were built considering the cost. Nothing is water (urine) proof, the motors quicky start rusting, as do the components of the sensor directly under the globe (I'm not even sure what that one is for). I've also had urine get into the circuit boards. The spring in the front sensors always fail after a while. The felt strips always come off after a while etc. The hall effect sensors have to be brushed out every 2nd day or so or they won't cycle properly. Is it worth upgrading to a new model, or do others report similar grievances on those also? Thanks for your opinions."
"Prospective Customer ConcernsI‚Äôm a prospective customer, currently trying to find an automatic litter box to replace two ScoopFree litter boxes that I‚Äôve been using faithfully, with zero issues for over 7-8 years. 

I‚Äôve completed what I can only describe as an obsessive level of research on the available options and it looks like it comes down to either the Leo‚Äôs Loo Too or the LR3/4. Every other option I‚Äôve found has some significant issue, usually leaking or something like that. 

As a prospective buyer, considering all these options cost 3-4x what I spent per ScoopFree litter box, I‚Äôm understandably hesitant to proceed with any option until I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs a good buy, and honestly, the reviews I‚Äôm seeing about Whisker have me weary. 

Is the feedback I‚Äôm hearing about Whisker and the quality of their products lately legitimate? Even on my end, I‚Äôve seen the slowness of Whisker‚Äôs response time - I asked them a simple question over 3 days ago, and they haven‚Äôt replied, despite the fact Facebook shows they read my message over 48 hours ago.

How has your experience with Whisker and their products been? Should I opt for the LR3 over the 4 as the 3 appears to be more reliable?

Edit: thanks everyone! I‚Äôve ordered the LR4. :)"
"what is the source of noise in the litter robot three?I have heard alot of bad things about the LR4, it just doesn't strike me as all that reliable from what I have read on reddit. Which makes the LR3 seem so much more appealing. The only thing that turns me off of the LR3 is the noise, does anyone know why it is so noisy? Is it a property of the motor, perhaps maybe a gearing thing? Is it friction between the golde and the base? This seems like a very solvable problem so has anyone tried?"
"Having tons of issues on the LR4 and its only a week oldSo is it just me, or does each Litter Robot keep getting less reliable with each generation? I had a LR2 that lasted a really really long time and was practically bulletproof until something started to warp and while it still works, it often gets off the tracks. LR3 was reliable for about 6 months and then became extremely problematic, stopping most of its cycles half way through. Replaced almost every part in there and still doesn't work. Ordered a LR4 hoping they had made something more like the LR2 this time but bigger and with all the tech. Nope. This thing is flimsy AF. The bonnet will not stay on it. I keep getting sensor errors on the app. And this morning I found a small plastic piece in the drawer, still not sure where it broke off from or how.   


I put in a support request today, but honestly I think I might just return this. It's absurd that this thing costs as much as a decent washing machine and is built so cheaply."
"'Unexpected Error' - Cannot connect LR4 to app via BluetoothI can't seem to find any solutions to the issue mentioned...I finally get the LR4 after months of backlog, then the app connection to the unit doesn't work. There doesn't seem to be any other option than to connect via Bluetooth, so that's not helpful. 

I've seen that others are also having this same issue, even after trying all of the things suggested (hard reset, close app, blah, blah, blah), which do not work. It's something within the unit that isn't picking up the Bluetooth signal. Tried everything imaginable, to no avail.

So far, not impressed and seems like an overpriced item that isn't going to be reliable.

Pluses: Quieter than the LR3...that's about it so far.

The fact that Litter Robot doesn't seem to have offered any resolutions is not comforting. I'll be contacting them again and may just return the whole thing since the advertised features don't work."
"my solution for a defect sensorMy LR3 stops to sense the cat pooping events correctly.  Tried to reset many times.  Not working.  I know the sensor is not reliable even you fix it.

So I just connect LR3 to IFTTT and Alexa.   Schedule three routines to clean at sunrise, noon and sunset.   My cat usually use LR for about 3 to 5 times a day and I know my cat is smart enough not to touch the LR when it is running.

My next step is to connect a motion sensor in the LR directly.

Now, I am not worrying about LR stop working for a whole day now. "
"2nd replacement DFI & pinch kit installed today - LR3\~3.5 years later and just replaced the DFI & pinch kit again,   first time it was a pinch sensor issue and this time it was erroneous drawer full that cleaning the sensors was not correcting.  It appears the drawer full sensors have been redesigned,  hopefully for better reliability.   With 3 cats it seems they only last 1-1.5 years before the corrosion causes faults. 

Anyhow I am going to buy another kit (maybe 2) to keep on standby for next 1-1.5 years when this set goes bad,  don't want to wait just in case they discontinue the kit down the road.   They are only $30 and seem to be the achilles heel of the LR3 so if I can keep my LR3 going for another 2-3 years with a couple kits its better than spending major coin for a new unit (LR3 is now more expensive than when I bought 3.5 years ago).   My ROI for the unit will be acceptable to me if I get another year or two out of the unit.

"LR4 first month: So many issues make me want to return itI ordered the LR4 even before I adopted my cat because of the long wait. Now it finally arrived and after more than 2 weeks of use, I already want to return it:

&#x200B;

1. WiFi randomly gets disconnected and it does not reconnect. I needed to turn it off and back on, or sometimes even redo the onboarding process. This happens more than once a day making the whole point of ""no scooping"" not true anymore, especially combined with the second point below. Oh, and if you are away from home, you have no way to get it back online and worst case scenario your cat loses the toilet.
2. \[Probably biggest dealbreaker\] Let's talk about reliability... one time the app shows ""Clean Cycle Complete"", but when I checked it was like halfway in the cycle - like, you can see the poop bag underneath. This means, if I did not notice it and did not reset it in time, my cat would have no toilet. And the app basically just lied to you. This one instance paranoid me so I am checking it regularly to make sure it was in the right state.
3. ""No scoop"" is a maybe, but ""no intervention"" is a lie. About HALF of the time, LR does not clean the poop. It is either stuck on the side, stuck on the net (the part that separates litter and poop), stuck on the edge of the litter pan on the silicon portion, or even outside on the step. My cat is relatively big (15 lb) but never got litter chunks out of the litter box before. Though it happened quite often with LR. \[Edit: comments say that delaying the cycle could fix some of the stuck clumps. I can see it fixes the plastic portions, but I am not convinced it's going to fix the silicon portion, but I will give it another week\]
4. Negative odor control. I am using the same litter (Arms & Hammer) as I used with a traditional litter box, it smells a lot worse. I actually like the smell of the raw litter (out of the box) but LR somehow removed the fresh litter smell and kinda emphasized the poop smell... 
5. The app is not very useful. The history is not complete if the cycle happens during the time it disconnects with Wifi. - Yes, even if it is back online there's no chance you get your data back! Also, the app does not refresh itself. After a cycle is finished, you need to manually refresh the page a few times to see the latest stats. No refresh no new data. It feels very awkward.  Combine with 1 you basically cannot treat the app seriously anymore...

I did not check the details about the return policy because I thought after so many generations this should be a good product now. Now I want to return it and saw that you need to pay a $75 shipping fee to return it. Is it worth $75 and the whole hassle to try this out? If I knew there would be so many issues I wouldn't try in the first place. Probably on me that I didn't do enough research. But I figured I'd still post it to see if any of these could be resolved or if any of these could help others when making the decision.

&#x200B;

Edit: Added a few more details. Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I will give it another week. "
"I thought this was supposed to *reduce* the amount of time/effort I spend on the litterbox.I cannot get my LR4 to work reliably enough I can even consider removing the other litterboxes.

Brand new LR4, set up on Monday.

* On laminate floor, no mat/carpet underneath
* Not touching the walls
* Using Dr. Elsey Ultra clumping cat litter
* Filled about 1cm under the fill line
* No nearby IR sources
* Firmware & app fully updated

It gets a ""Cat Detected"" error (usually twice) during at least 2/3 of the cycles, but manages to finish, taking about 5 minutes for a clean cycle. It's lost the plot every single night via ""Cat Sensor Fault"", twice leaving it stuck with the hellmouth to the drawer left open for hours. After that I put it on a sleep cycle overnight, so at least it'd remain usable. Cat Sensor Faults constantly. Last night I got a ""Cat Sensor Fault"" notification at midnight, smack in the middle of the sleep cycle & when I checked on it in the morning it took 3 manual interventions to get the cycle completed.

I've cleaned the sensors, I've taken off the bonnet & reseated the dome, I've sat & watched it cycle more times than I ever wanted to.

Does this get better? Is there more I need to do to dial it in? What could possibly be causing so many false positive sensor issues in a brand-new, barely-used product?"
"Should I hold off on purchasing a Litter Robot 4?I always wanted a litter robot as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone when I say cleaning up cat poop is the worst part of owning a cat. With the release of the LR4, I was very interested in purchasing one but this is what gathered in less than 30 minutes of searching Reddit for an answer:

The liner is thin and tears easily. 
The charcoal filter needs to sit correctly or it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit not on a perfectly flat 180 degree surface, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the litter is too heavy or too light, it won‚Äôt work. 
If there is too much litter or too little litter, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit is facing a window, it won‚Äôt work. 
If you have indoor security cameras with night vision, it won‚Äôt work. 
The chances of getting a machine that actually works in the first place isn‚Äôt too high and a lot of you are on your second LR4 unit already. 

The list goes on, and I‚Äôm truly wondering: is this nearly $700 machine truly worth it? If I‚Äôm paying that much for anything, I expect it to work without much troubleshooting and be reliable for a reasonable amount of time. Or should I hold off to see if any of these issues are addressed?"
"For a $650 Product Under Warranty its Got to be the Worst Customer Experience Ever!My litter-robot hasn‚Äôt been operational for over 3 months. I‚Äôve received absolutely no support from the company Whisker after sending various forms of correspondence to your organization asking for assistance. I‚Äôve made exhaustive self help searches on Whisker customer support pages - read Whisker support instructions, viewed numerous You-Tube videos, searched/ researched/ read many WEB pages and it appears the robot cannot be fixed. The Whisker organization doesn‚Äôt have the interest in helping me and the product is under warranty. 

In late July, I called customer support and was put on hold. After over an hour, I selected the ‚Äúcall-back‚Äù feature. After two weeks I had not received a call-back, I called Whisker several times believing no-contact was an aberration, thinking surely no reputable Business would disregard their customers. After each of these calls I was put on hold. I wasn‚Äôt going to do the ‚ÄúNO CALL BACK‚Äù Option so on 8/10 I submitted a support ticket (00917433). Two weeks later (8/25) a Whisker email requested I send the litter-box SN (LR3CI378274). Hey, I used the SN to create the ticket! I was unable to respond to the Whisker email in the time-frame Whisker stipulated, and my case was dropped. I replied with an email on 9/4 letting Whisker know I didn't see the email in time, and needed assistance. Guess what? I still haven‚Äôt heard back from that email. Since the litter box is under warranty, I thought maybe Whisker would prefer to complete a refund of my order (#100805315). I submitted a refund request on 10/5. Guess what? I still have not received a call, letter or email.  

To be clear, I‚Äôm able to get the robot working one cycle at a time. However, the robot continues to loop through the two messages (1) pinch fault and (2) Box Full. The pan isn‚Äôt full. It has one clump in it. To get the box working, I‚Äôve gone through a series of steps numerous times. I‚Äôm able to clear the error messages and ready the box for my cat. He uses the box **once** maybe twice before I have to ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù the sensors and box. It takes about an hour to get the box ready, and only about 2 minutes to manually scoop. I finally gave up and unplugged the beast (not the cat). Here are the onerous steps I take each time to ready the box.  

A Pinch fault error causes the contraption to be inoperable 

1. I deep clean the globe, remove all stuck waste, brush, and vacuum litter out of base including the pinch detectors, reassemble and reset. The litter box message states ""ready. 
2. This deep clean process takes nearly an hour. I have to move the Globe outside the house because because all the litter sits up underneath the globe (on top), and I have to rock the globe back and forth to the litter to fall out. A big mess in the house the first time. 
3. My cat uses the box **once,** the robot cycles and the message ‚Äúbox full‚Äù is immediately received. The box has one clump!!
4. I dump the single clump from the pan, Ready the box, the cat uses **Once**, and the message ‚Äúpinch detected‚Äù is received. Its back to dragging the contraption outside again
5. I do another deep-clean and ready the box. The box indicates good to go (‚ÄúReady‚Äù)
6. Steps above (1-6) are repeated each and every time my cat uses the box
7. The box in its current state is not operational and is unplugged.

MANUAL SCOOPING IS RELIABLE and WORKS!!"
"LR3 issues getting ""stuck"" upside down for no reasonHi, LR3 Connected. Have had for a little over 2 years and love it. Works great w/two cats.

Getting the dreaded ""lets get stuck upside down with no litter"", which we at least get reliable ""clean cycle interrupted"" messages.

It's obviously after one of our two cats does their thing, but no cat or anything goes into the LR. I just observed. Cleaned it a month ago, so everything is fairly tidy and no sensor blocked.

Is there a way to debug this besides coming upstairs to a treat from our male cat? Our female usually acts funny and howls, I assume because she holds it in.

To reset? We have to un-plug and then hope when you re-plug, the bin goes into ""reset"" mode and can find the 0 datum on the rotating part. Sometimes, it requires multiple unplug<->plug, reset, cycles to get this to happen though."
"Issues with LRF - optimal litter but there's not much, don't get consistent notifications, randomly goes offlineHi all,

I'm very close to just returning the LR4 and annoyed with all the issues ive been experiencing.

I've had it setup for about a week now. 

When I left for work the other day I noticed it was still stuck in sleep mode, when selecting to change the mode it states it's offline, did my cat manually turn it off? This happened twice.

I don't get any notifications whenever the robot is being used or cleaned, contacted CS they sent me an email but did not reply, it's been 4 days...

Anyone experience these issues before? Doesn't seem right for a machine that's so expensive. I know some people swear by these robots but I'm having nothing but problems. 

Another important issue is within the app it shows there is optimal litter but when looking in the robot it is severely low. Is this normal? I hVe t seen the optimal status change once... I do see the level was lower than 50 in the app but still read as optimal litter...

Super annoyed."
"LR4 has consistently stopped at this exact spot during a cycle. This is while it is on its way back to normal position after dumping waste. I cleaned the sensors and dumped the waste bin last night, didn't fix it. Any ideas why it is doing this? (yes, I know I need to clean the inside)"
"LR3 DFI & Pinch issuesHi all, hoping someone can help me with this issue as I'm beyond frustrated!

I have 2 LR3s and an LR2. I LOVE my LR2 - she's around 18 years old and still works like a freaking champ, even if I do need to eventually get around to replacing the groaning motor :D My LR3s on the other hand... nothing but frustration. BOTH have the issue mentioned in the title. Power on and blue ready light flashes. Press reset and the yellow light fast flashes. I've tried bypassing the pinch detector on one of them (electrical tape trick after verifying neither tab has any corrosion), however the error still persists. Neither cycles at all. 

Whiskers is supposedly sending me a new DFI for one of the LR3s, and I've just submitted a ticket for the 2nd. In the meantime, I'm stuck scooping multiple normal boxes for a spoiled 6 year old & a 5month old who both think litter boxes should all be miraculously clean every time they enter... 

If anyone has suggestions for either bypassing the pinch detector and/or convincing the system that the drawer isn't full (a little funny, considering there isn't even a bag in it at this point!) that don't include replacing the DFI, I'd be incredibly grateful!"
"Frustrated is an understatementSo about once a week the robot 4 gets a cat sensor fault at 1 am . I‚Äôm asleep and don‚Äôt see it and the cats use the rest of the house as a cat box.

I spent over $900 for a cat box that my cats can‚Äôt use consistently and they pee and poop all over the house when it faults.
I also had contacted whisker about the liner the cats scratched through. I submitted a ticket and didn‚Äôt hear back so I had to contact them again I was lucky to get through via chat and the rep was great and sent me a new liner but I shouldn‚Äôt of had to chase them down for the issue. I had even purchased the extended warranty. 

Not to mention no matter what litter I use it just cakes up on the liner and I have to deep clean it once a week and scrap the caked on pee.
It seems at this point I‚Äôm spending more time and energy deep cleaning and cleaning up pee around the house than I would be if I kept the traditional cat box."
"Cat won‚Äôt use consistentlyMy partner purchased the LR3 last year when our cat stopped using her other automatic litter box, and while it took some time for her to adjust, she eventually began using it regularly. However, over the last year, there have been about 2 instances where she just stops using it and instead will meow to go outside or has peed on the floor or the couch. She isn‚Äôt an outdoor cat, but goes outside with supervision and I‚Äôve rarely seen her go potty outside. She will use the LR if you place her in it (which I‚Äôve started to do) but otherwise she really isn‚Äôt using it on her own. I have no idea what could be frustrating her about it, or if she‚Äôs just forgetting it‚Äôs there? We cleaned it thoroughly about a month ago, and last week I used wipes to clean the inside of the globe. Still, no regular use on her own. Has anybody else experienced this? Any tips?? I‚Äôm pulling my hair out over here!"
"Just got off the phone with support--I'm scheduled to get my 3rd LR4 (2nd replacement). Heed my advice.I don't know why it happens, and I don't know how to fix it (if there is an engineer out there who has reverse-engineered their LR4 and can share some information, I would love to hear from you), but these LR4's seem to work fine immediately out of the box, for a couple of months, and then the issues start to appear. This first replacement unit (2nd LR4) that I have now, I literally placed it on my level, flat, hardwood floor back in February of this year, and I haven't moved it until yesterday when the errors became intolerable. After my experience with my first LR4 unit that I received in the fall of 2022, I knew not to fall prey to hopeful, wishful thinking that the LR4 will just magically start to work properly. This time, I only tolerate ONE cat-shit-outside-the-LR4-on-the-floor-mat, not multiple cat shits on the floor and cat pees on my living room couch like I did over the 2022-2023 winter season. No, f\*\*\* that. I took it into my garage and spent about 6 hours cleaning and troubleshooting, to no success. My LR4 gets stuck at the exact same spot mid-cycle, and there is no way to continue or cancel the cycle using any combination of button-pushes and power-cycles. Once it gets to this one spot mid-cycle, the only way for me to get it back to the home position is to take the bonnet off and manually rotate the globe with my hands.

I don't understand how this company could be so irresponsible and careless. I'm about to receive my third LR4 unit. Third! Whisker must be losing money from this LR4 product... and if they're not, then that thing must be sooooo overpriced that the cost to produce must be close to $50, and the remaining $650 goes to funding all the customer support, tech support, shipping and handling, replacement units, etc.

Why the f\*\*\* didn't this company perform thorough product testing and R&D before releasing this product? And, if they did, and they knew this product was faulty when they released it, then why did they go ahead with the release? Why would the CEO decide to release a bad product and upset a large subset of Whisker's customers?

&#x200B;

My advice to any new LR4 owners is as follows: **do not tolerate the solid-red-lights cycle interruptions.** If your cat(s) is(are) anything like mine, then they probably don't poke their head into the unit while the damn thing is rotating. Most cats, I think, won't do that, because they're literally scaredy-cats. Especially do NOT tolerate solid-red-light cycle interruptions that are difficult or impossible to clear by some combination of button-presses and/or power-cycling the unit. You can try cleaning it, but if you've owned it for at least 1 or 2 months and you start to get these cycle interruptions then it's probably not because of dirt and debris (unless yours is really, really dirty). Do **not** hope and pray that these faults go away. Just pick up the LR4, bring it into your garage or some place where you can troubleshoot it, put out an ol'fashioned litter box for your cat(s), and try to get your damned LR4 to work PROPERLY and CONSISTENTLY. Try to get it to consistently cycle without any interruptions, and don't put it back to use until you are satisfied! Otherwise, you'll probably come home to a pile of cat crap and/or piss because your LR4 got stuck mid-cycle and your cat(s) had nowhere to go #2.

We paid $700 for a big hunk of plastic, a motor, some sensors, and some circuitry. We paid $700 for a product that WORKS, not one that will unexpectedly stop working while you're at work so your cat will ruin your $2000 couch!! We deserve more than that for $700.

Let's say you would otherwise spend 3 minutes, every day, scooping cat litter. After 90 days (the approximately lifetime of these LR4 units, in my experience), that cumulative time is 4.5 hours. Given the $700 that you paid to not have to do all the scooping, that's an hourly rate of $155 per hour."
"At my wits endNo matter what I do, my Litter Robot 4 keeps saying its waste bag is full whenever it is actually like 30% full. It's remarkably consistent in that. I'm sick of going through  a bag every 2 days. What can I do?"
"Sherman pees in the very back- how bad is this?Hey, first full week of the LR3. I keep it off. He‚Äôs pottying consistently in it. I turn it on when I‚Äôm home from work, maybe 1-2x/day to enjoy benefit. Anyway, noticing his pee pattern , as per his normal, is high up in the back. I‚Äôm reading up on LR, thanks to you all. Long-term, will his lifetime pee pattern lead to an inoperable LR? I try to reshape his litter and push it higher and wipe the rubber to simply clean it. Appreciate your input!"
"Can't believe I need a Litter Robot support group but here I am. I have a LR 3 connect. Does anyone have any tips to get a cat to use it. No litter box problems until now. One cat I can't keep out of it, another does his business and gets out and my female won't use it at all."
Cat terrified of robotJust had my LR4 for over two weeks now. I finally after a lot of coaxing and treats convinced both cats to use the bot. Since they were both using it consistently I decided to try and leave it turned on to cycle (my mistake‚Ä¶) and now one of my cats is terrified of the robot and protest pooped/peed on the floor this morning. Am I screwed? I turned it back off but I‚Äôm unsure of what to do at this point. I still have a traditional litter box next to the LR4.
"My cat is obsessed with licking the LR4'S front step?!I'm assuming something from the factory or the coating of the robot itself is delicious to my senior kitty -- I got the LR4 two days ago and although kitty has gone into it once, she's mostly just interested in licking the textured grate of the step. Does anyone else have this bizarre/silly issue? Is it just a textural thing, maybe? I wiped the step down with isopropyl (and then water) thinking that would remove whatever was appealing to her, but no luck."
"My cat waits for the LR4 to cycle then attacks the clumped pee out the LRMy 1st cat took to the LR4 immediately. My 2nd cat was terrified at first and completely refused to use the LR. After a while she finally got around to using it normally. She has been using it consistently for 4 months without fear of walking in or out of it. 
The problem is that she has grown a habit of waiting for the robot to cycle so that she can hiss and attack the clumps sometimes even grabbing the clumps out of the box and onto the floor. I am unsure of how to curb this aggressive behavior towards the LR? Anybody else had their cat behave this way?"
"Just got my LR4 - it works great!I just wanted to put a positive ‚Äúit works!‚Äù post here because before I got my litter robot, I read through many of the threads here and was very worried about whether it would work out or if I would regret it. 

I‚Äôm happy to report that both my cats used the litter robot within a few hours of me setting it up and have used it consistently for the past 4 days! They have not once returned to their old litter.

Also, the machine appears to be working great, set up was very easy and straightforward and I‚Äôve had no trouble with the sensor or the cycles being completed. The app is also great for controlling it (setting up sleep mode, minutes delay before cycling, etc.).

I use the Boxiecat pro litter (as suggested by several users on this sub) and it has worked great thus far- no residue left on the inside of the robot, no odors, great clumping, very little tracking.

All in all, I love my litter robot 4 (and my cats do too!) and I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase!"
"stuck on pause cycleAnyone have an issue where your litter robot 4 will pause during a cycle and get stuck there no matter what you try to do to fix it? Mine will be fine for a few days then get stuck and it always happens in the most inconvenientb imes like not being home and then our cat will poop in front of the litter robot because it can't go inside. 

Anyone have a fix for it?"
"My experience/review with Pretty Litter and LR4I bought the LR4 around 4 months ago. Before that I have been using Pretty Litter with my cat for the last 4 years, primarily because the odor control was much better than any other litter I‚Äôve tried. Before buying the Litter Robot I searched for people‚Äôs experiences/reviews using Pretty Litter with it and I only found a few posts and some mixed reviews, so I thought now that I‚Äôve been using it for a while I‚Äôd share my experience here in hopes it might help other people. 

First of all: Does it work? Yes! At least for me, it works almost perfectly. One bag of pretty litter fills up just about right to the fill line. Also, since I used to use a bigger litter box with 2 bags per month, now that I only use one bag per month I‚Äôm even saving money. The only slight weirdness to keep in mind is the ‚Äúlitter level‚Äù reading on the app won‚Äôt work, it will always think the litter is low since it is based on weight and the Pretty Litter weighs a lot less than normal clay clumping litter. 

With the litter robot I find that the pretty litter in fact lasts even longer than it did before when I was scooping it manually, because when it spins some of the litter that is covered in pee drops down along with the poop, even though it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúactually‚Äù clump. This also has a bonus effect that you can still use the health monitoring feature of the litter by just opening the drawer when you get a notification that the clean cycle has finished and you will likely see the colored crystals. In the normal litter box a lot of the time by the time I scooped, the color would have mostly faded unless I scooped pretty soon after my cat happened to pee. 

Also, the odor control has been excellent in my experience. I read some reviews on here which said the Pretty Litter caused the litter robot to smell really bad, which honestly I haven‚Äôt had any experience even close to that. The few times I tried other litters before (several different ‚Äúodor blocking‚Äù clay litters, also pine and corn) they all smelled significantly worse. 

Another plus is that since not as much litter gets wasted forming pee clumps, the waste drawer fills up very slowly and the litter doesn‚Äôt significantly deplete to a level where I have to add more. I only have to empty the drawer around once a month which also matches with the same frequency I switch out the litter to a new pretty litter bag which works well since I can just push the ‚Äúempty‚Äù button and remove the waste from the month along with the emptied litter. Since the waste is still covered with crystals, it doesn‚Äôt actually smell bad, at least with just my one cat using it. Wiping down the globe is also usually pretty easy, unless you waited too long to switch the litter and pee started to stick to the side (the litter does kind of lose its absorbing power at about the 5-6 week mark in my experience with one cat) although you can just mix it around some with a scoop before emptying to mitigate that issue. 

My cat learned to use the robot pretty quickly, and even keeps sticking his head in there while it‚Äôs cycling which causes it to pause and continue later but it hasn‚Äôt had errors for that reason so far. I did have one sensor fault which I had to restart the robot, but I think that‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt wipe the sensors the first time I swapped out the litter so they accumulated some dust over the two months. 

Another negative it that it does track litter more than my old litter box which was a top entry where the cat had to jump in and out from above. And probably tracks more than heavier litter alternatives such as clay. 

Of course, my experience may not apply to everyone. I know for multiple cats pretty litter usually recommends multiple bags per month which obviously wouldn‚Äôt fit in the litter robot (though maybe you can also just switch it out more often?) I also believe the people with odor problems were telling the truth about their experience, though I can‚Äôt explain why their experience is so different from mine. Maybe different cats have different poop consistencies which don‚Äôt work as well with the non clumping litter. 

But if you find yourself annoyed by having to empty the waste bin a lot or the clay litter smelling bad and you don‚Äôt mind the additional cost of silica litter, I do think it could be worth a try. 

I hope this post is helpful to others who are currently happy with pretty litter and considering getting the litter robot, or vice versa if people are having problems with the clumping litter and want to explore an alternative."
"LR4: 3 weeks in and very pleasedWanted to post our experience so far for anyone curious. 

TL;DR: Yes, we love it. So do the cats. Yes, even with some minor issues, I would still highly recommend it and I'd buy it again.

We bought the LR4 knowing full well the variety of issues many people were having. I did quite a bit of research on automatic litter boxes, and even with the issues people are having, LR was still the most consistently well rated of all of them. The LR4 would also be more comfortable for our long boy. He was the reason we were looking at this; he was peeing outside the 4 litter boxes we have (for 2 cats) once in a while, so we wanted to try this to see if it worked any better for him. Unfortunately for our wallets, he freaking loves it.

We made the purchase Dec 5 2022 and it arrived by Dec 28. Within 5 minutes of setting it up, both cats went inside (even after seeing it cycle for the first time upon plugin). They both used it within 10 minutes, and haven't touched any of the other litter boxes since (I know, we got super lucky). We have a 3-story townhouse, and I thought for sure they'd at least use the upstairs ones at night for convenience since they sleep with us upstairs, but they insist on walking all the way down to the basement to potty in their new automatic throne. They absolutely love it. And I love not having to clean out 4 litter boxes. 

Overall, we haven't had any major issues. However, what we have experienced:

* occasional ""cat sensor fault"" errors. This only ever happens after I refill the litter, and after I wipe out the sensors with a microfiber cloth, the error goes away. I've taken to refilling the litter, letting the dust settle for a minute or two, and then wiping. So far since I adjusted to that pattern, I haven't seen the cat sensor fault error. (Thanks to various posts in this sub for the wiping out the sensors tip.) This seems like it can't be avoided; you can't control dust. I don't mind wiping out the sensors because it's super easy.
* The liner got small rips in it in 6 days. Contacting support via website chat was super easy, and they promised to send out a replacement globe liner. It took about a week and half, but I finally got the shipped notification yesterday. Luckily we can still use ours with the small rips, but if it were anything major that meant we couldn't use the LR until the replacement arrived, I'd be disappointed in the shipping time. 

Other info if useful:

* **Cat litter**: Dr Elsey's Ultra Unscented Clumping Clay litter
   * We also keep the litter in a bin next to the LR with a 2 cup scoop inside. This makes refilling super easy (also a tip from this sub). We buy the litter in 40 lb bags, so it's really nice being able to scoop it into the LR instead of awkwardly dumping a heavy bag. 
   * I have asthma and this is the lowest dust option I have been able to find.
   * Tracking: it happens. it's a little maddening, ngl. But for now we're just vacuuming the area regularly and putting down various litter mats. 
* **Waste drawer**: 
   * Liners: The ones LR provides are sturdy and they work. However, they don't have draw strings so tying them off is a little tedious (for me and my preferences). I ended up getting these [eco liners from Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8WR8RFH). They're specifically designed for the LR4 drawer (they have LR3 ones as well), they have draw strings which makes emptying it SUPER fast and easy, and I don't feel awful about putting so much plastic out into the environment.
   * Emptying: With 2 cats, we empty the drawer once every 3-4 days since this is the only LR we have and they refuse to use any of the other ""basic"" boxes we have around the house. Again, with the draw string eco liners, it's easy and I don't feel bad about how much plastic we're going through. 
* **Weight sensor**: Ours is pretty accurate. We have it on vinyl flooring with no pads or anything under the LR. It weighed the boy at 12.3 one morning, I took him to the vet a few hours later for a checkup, and they weighed him at 12.3 as well. The LR scale can vary by a few ounces (sometimes the boy will be 12.3 and sometimes 11.7, but it doesn't switch back and forth between them, so it could be time of day, if he's had water or food, etc.) but I don't need to know exact weights. Just keeping an eye on their general weight is good enough for my use case. 

Again, overall super happy with this and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Hope this post is useful to others trying to decide."
"One of my kittens is far too interested in the cleaning cycle.Now, we‚Äôve only had the Litter-Robot 4 for just over a week. Both cats took to it fairly quick. The cat in question took to it instantly. They are both about 4.5months old. One is more adventurous than the other but as soon as a cycle starts no matter where they are in the house they run for the robot. 

My app history is full of cycle interruptions I‚Äôve watched it in person to see it too. I‚Äôve even picked up the kitten or moved her away just to see how much she needs to watch this. 

Each time she interrupts it she goes in, trills and pads around inside, paws at the bits here and there, jumps out, and jumps back in, rinse and repeat. Often she will jump out and wait for the cycle to resume, then jump back in. Once she got in while the waste bin portion was open to air. I don‚Äôt know if it concerns her that there is (I presume) so much odour. She seems to try covering it by pawing on the plastic walls but also steps down into the waste bucket üò≥üôÑ

As for things I‚Äôve tried:

- Leaving sleep mode on  24/7 - trigger manual cycles through the day. What‚Äôs the point? It changes nothing but frequency of the cycle but not the behaviour.

- Set maximum delay before a cycle starts. This has probably been the best thing, plus sleep mode through the night. The idea is that it becomes more about using the litter than the cycle. But not to the point it becomes a manual cycling affair. 

Not sure if the kitty is just curious, I assume so, or disturbed by the fact that her scent keeps getting removed. I once watched her (not ‚Äúwatch watch‚Äù), go pee, get out, wait and interrupt the cycle (short delay at that point), then poop at the point just before the litter vanishes behind the grate, then get out and keep interrupting the cycle‚Ä¶when it finally completed after about 20min she went back in, and as if by magic pooped again as soon as it was done. She seemed ‚Äúquite concerned‚Äù when sniffing around when it was clean, so who knows‚Ä¶maybe she wanted to scent it up. I don‚Äôt mean to humanize her motives but I‚Äôm trying for some sort of rationale. Maybe she was actually doing me a favour and being patient before pooping? I have no idea what goes through a cat brain. 

Finally, when trying to keep her out during a cycle using my foot or picking her up, it‚Äôs almost like trying to keep an adult cat from catnip. It borders on a bit crazy trying again and again to get back in. I won‚Äôt be doing that again, I was just trying to see how much this was curiosity or need vs something else. She was pretty worked up trying everything to sneak back in. I don‚Äôt want to do anything to dissuade her from using it and trying to stop her from interrupting it is obviously pointless, she couldn‚Äôt separate the two concepts I‚Äôm sure, so I‚Äôll let her do her thing.

So I give up. She is using it right, at least initially, I have the longest delay set in hopes they might be too occupied to bother with it. My concern is she will start to trigger cycles and do her business mid cycle or get her paws into the waste bin consistently, I don‚Äôt want it to be come part of her routine. 

Anyone have a cat who was like this but settled down? Her sister is sane, on this issue at least üòÇ

So should I stay with the king delay cycle? Or set it as short as possible so it keeps triggering a cycle in hopes she bores of it?"
Stubborn Cat Finally Using LR4We have had the litter robot for about a month now and we're struggling getting one of our cats to use it. She finally started to use it consistently after we made a small  platform around the level of the step for her to jump on to get into the litter robot. Hopefully this helps anyone else with a stubborn cat.
"LR4 Completely Broke after 2 WeeksIs anyone else having this issue or have solutions for it? I am beyond frustrated with my purchase of the LR4. Not only did it take 6 extra weeks to arrive after I was told with the pre-order that it would be here in July, but it only ""worked"" for about two weeks. While it worked it was great, but that was very short lived. After those two weeks I have been faced constantly with the solid red bar and notifications such as ""cat sensor fault"" ""cycle interrupted"" ""cycle paused"" and there is nothing blocking the sensors, no cat in the litter box, nothing. I have tried calling the company, their phones are shut down due to high volume of calls, I have tried emailing the company only to not get a response, I have tried the chat function that is pushed so hard, and it never works, I have even tried contacting them on Instagram to be met only with automated responses, now I‚Äôm trying Reddit, maybe I‚Äôll have better luck? I have done everything possible listed under troubleshooting for the LR4: cleaning the sensors, emptying the entire thing, resetting the system by pushing down the reset and connect until it turns off then wait two minutes then turn back on, removing the globe to empty and clean it, I have tried everything. Nothing works. It may ""fix"" the issue for 30 seconds, only for it to start cycling and then proceed to have a cat sensor failure and then stops completely while the globe is all the way upside down. For obvious reasons, my cats can't use the litter box when the litter is covered and it is stuck ""emptying"" and I'm getting tired of my hardwood floors getting ruined because they are going to the bathroom outside of the litter box because it consistently doesn't work. I am very upset, frustrated, disappointed in the fact that I spent so much money on what came highly recommended to me, only to be met with so many problems and no solutions. I'm not sure what else to do since I am not receiving communication back in any capacity. The entire thing doesn‚Äôt work anymore whatsoever. üòï"
"Litter Robot 4 stops mid-cycle and won't restartI have a 4 and am having a consistent issue with the cycle stopping mid-way but not finishing.

About 3x a week, I will come into the room and the robot will be stopped mid-cycle, at the point where the hole is lined up with the tray, and a solid red light.  My first thought is that, of course, one of the cats has messed with it and it's on pause.

Except it doesn't kick back on after 7 minutes and finishes the cycle.

This morning I walked in to it mid-cycle and stopped with a solid red light.  I checked the app and it had been more than 7 minutes--by quite a bit--.  I did the following: Did a ""start cycle"" on the app (no response).  Did a ""start cycle"" with the buttons on top of the robot (no response).  Turned the robot off and on again (cycled thru the lights and stopped on solid red again).  Completely unplugged the robot and plugged it back in (that time it did start to do the cycle then immediately stopped).  Lifted and swept under the robot, then tried to ""start cycle"" again.  Nothing.  There is nothing in the way, there is nothing poopy hanging around, the liner has ""popped"", nothing looks different from any other time it's been used.  The tray is not full nor is anything blocking the opening.

The problem here is twofold: I leave for work in 15 minutes and the litter box is unusable.  So how does that work exactly?  And of course #2 (LOL) is that I paid a lot of money for a litter box, not to be spending too much time trying to get it to function.  For $800 it should almost wipe my cat's butt for me, not me spending the morning trying to reset it so that the cats can use it at all.

Did I get a lemon?"
"At the End of My RopeHi everyone, just looking for some support or advice. My cat started using the litter robot great day one, but then has progressively become more and more afraid of it over time. I have now found that she was peeing inside one of those wool cave beds while also using the litter robot every day or so (hardwood floor damage‚Äînot happy). Does anyone have any advice as to behavior regression with the litter robot? Or how to make it more appealing?"

"LR 3 Connect- Customer Service gone quietHello, have an issue w/LR3 Connect not connecting to wifi.  Spent 8-10 hrs trying different configurations using the legacy app and the new whisker app, adding the robot's mac address to my network, etc.  Got in touch w/customer service and they asked me additional questions but it's been nearly a week without any answer.  Called three times leaving my phone number for call back and sitting on queue for 40+ mins, still nothing....

What gives w/the customer service?  Looks like LR4 went live and must be getting inundated, but at least email me back!!!  I'm a repeat customer going from LR2 globe to LR3 connect and have been unable to use LR3 connect as intended for over a month.

Any suggestions?  Any customer reps filtering reddit?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*7/24 update\*\*\*

 \*\*\*Appears this is a common issue with older LR3 Connects for Serials LR3C. There was a firmware update for the physical base which appears to be hit or miss in terms of customers having to spend money to ""update.""

Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/o47q6u/connect\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/o47q6u/connect_not_working/)

**Received response: 7/23 via email**

Well after several days I received a response via email with two options:

1.) Restoration/Repair- $180 + tax +$10 shipping so \~$200+ (I suspect this is the updated base as indicated in the source above).

2.) Replace for a new unit $494 + tax or base $359 + tax (10% loyalty discount)

LR is not standing behind their product. I bought a $499 unit three years ago to specifically have wifi capabilities and now to not be able to use because of their own firmware update and having to shell out an additional $200 to make it wifi capable is unacceptable.

I'm 15-hrs + into this project with the troubleshooting and now back and forth with LR Customer Service. I'm documenting this for any future customers that have similar issues. I've been a loyal customer (purchased LR 2 and LR 3 connect- spent over $850 for this product) and I am giving them the opportunity to make this right.

**I have responded to Whisker requesting an updated base/equipment to make it compliant with the firmware and will update back as I receive a response.**"
"Should I get a Litter-Robot?Hi all, I've been looking at a lot of automatic litter trays for my two young cats. I initially dismissed the Litter-Robot because I thought the design looked straight out of the 1980s and was drawn to the cool looking Kickstarter backed designs with Wi-Fi and app integration. However, the reviews for many of those devices have been disappointing, with poor customer service. I just saw that LR has brought out a 3rd gen unit ‚Äì available in grey (which looks much better) ‚Äì and is WiFi capable, but I'm still sceptical despite the many good reviews. I need your help convincing me!  


**My main concerns are:** 

* Soiled litter leaving marks and detritus on the inside of the globe as it rotates - is this down to the type of litter you use and how long you leave it before it clumps? I use Cat's Best Organic Wood Granule Clumping Cat Litter, it clumps pretty quickly so I would hope this would be OK but let me know your experiences! I don't want my kitties fur getting covered in their own waste.
* Seems quite a few people suffer from problems with the globe becoming stuck or something causing it to stop rotating? What causes this normally?
* The 90-day trial is a big draw for me as it lessens the risk I'll be buying a big lemon that sits in the corner of the room and never gets used. How are people's experiences with LR customer service in this regard?   


Thanks all, appreciate any help you can offer!"
"LR 3 with or without WiFiI have the opportunity to buy a used LR3 on fb but it doesn‚Äôt have WiFi capabilities. The guy is asking for $250, but I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm missing out on the true experience without the app or am I overthinking it and it‚Äôs just as useful regardless? 

Also, is $250 a fair price?


Idk if this helps but I have 2 cats. A boy orange tabby and a black short hair girl. They have been giving my two normal litter boxes hell and I can‚Äôt keep up üòÇ"
Alexa skill? It seems to me that it would be helpful if there was an Alexa skill that declares for all to hear that litter needs added or the drawer is full so one person isn't responsible for keeping track of it in the app. I didn't see anything in the Alexa app...
"Solution for the most common LR3 failureThis is for those that are out of warranty or want to quickly fix their LR3's infamous blue flashing light, (Drawer full message), yellow fast flashing light (pinch detect) or are experiencing a labored motor sound when in cycle that eventually results in a Over torque fault, (Alternating yellow to red lights). These conditions are a direct result of the DFI failing.

The issue with the LR3's DFI is the fact the emitter board's I/O expander chip pins are being subjected to excessive moisture causing corrosion on the bank of pins that are exposed by the DFI shield's opening located at it's center is breaching the inadequate clearcoat that's suppose to render the circuit boards moisture resistant. (I've also noticed some of the solder joints to be less than adequate as well contributing to the issue). As a result 1 or more of the chips pins are experiencing tarnishing and corrosion creating bad solder joints. (the solder used has a high silver content and little to no lead, when silver is exposed to moisture it tarnishes, it turns, you guessed it?!, BLACK!)I have 3 LR3's and they all have suffered the same issue. When they were in warranty I had the DFI kits sent out and I kept the old DFI's. When the third one went I noticed the tarnishing on the chip pins, so I took a look a look at the old replaced DFI's and sure enough the same tarnished corrosion on the same spot!

The good news is its salvageable without replacement!!! The fix is to remove the DFI from the base unit, carefully clean as much of the corrosion off the pins as possible and re-solder all 10 pins on that side of the chip. Verify the work, clean all the flux off, and use a clear coat to seal the chip pins up so the problem doesn't return!!!

I've done this to many DFI boards and they work perfectly! I've only had one I/O chip failure and the replacement part literally is $1.50!!, It's a no-brainer financially!!! To me re-soldering SMT (Surface Mount Technology) components is fairly easy and if you have the solder skills, Awesome!.  Unfortunately to most its rocket science. But!, if you know someone that can do it or have an electronics repair shop in your area its literally a 5 to 10 minute job!!! And it will in 99.999% of the time get you back up and running once again!."
"Pinching My Fingers!I must be doing something wrong. 

I'm still a relatively new user. Every time I change the bag, my fingers get pinched or scraped when I push each of the four edges down into the holder prongs. 

Is there a skill or trick to this? 

2 cats, so I'm doing this every 3 days or so."
"It's now been a couple months and the notification issue is still ongoing for my LR3.Is the engineering team working on it completely inept? The app can perfectly read the levels of litter, but just refuses to notify me when it's full. Wonderful that the product I paid extra for can't do it's most important feature. Time to update my previously positive review on several sites... Tired of being told that it's being worked on.. Probably will check the other litter machine options next time I'm in the market for buying a device for hundreds of dollars. I'm sure those companies are competent enough to ensure basic features work."
"DFI Kit Replacement SuccessJust wanted to share a positive support experience I had.

A week ago, the pinch detector went off, and since then, the device stopped working. Did a full cleaning, triple checked the pinch detector was clear with no litter and verified that the circuit was complete with a multimeter - something else was wrong. The app just showed an exclamation mark with no error description, and the board was blinking the blue ""ready"" light slowly.

I called support, they treated me like a competent individual (rare for support teams) and offered to send me a replacement DFI kit (sensor linked to the pinch detector). It came in under a week, I followed the relatively clear instructions for dissasembling and replacing the sensor, put it all back together, and the litterbot is back to working normally.

Thanks!"
"Debating returning LR4 due to curtain sensorsMy cat is happily using the LR4 and overall I like it. Well, I like the concept. 

However, it is constantly getting the cycle interrupted, and the interruption doesn‚Äôt get resolved so eventually it just turns off, stuck in whatever position it interrupted in. Most of the time, that‚Äôs an unusable state for the cat. Sometimes, it interrupts when the litter is pooled to one extreme side, so the calibration error is thrown. So I have to go and shake the box around until the litter settles more towards the bottom, so I can finally reset the box. I am resetting or troubleshooting this box at least once a day. Some days, it has been every time the cat uses the LR4.

The LR4 is on a solid piece of concrete floor. The floor underneath is clean, and I have vacuumed it religiously. I clean the curtain sensors every day when I inevitably go to reset the LR4. I de-fur the felt strips every day as the cat‚Äôs long fur can get a few small clumps in it.  I‚Äôve taken the LR4 apart many times, checking for anything snagging or obstructing. I know it isn‚Äôt the cat cause I‚Äôll be standing right next to the box when it gets interrupted and I can‚Äôt see anything that could possibly be interrupting it.

My last Hail Mary is trying a less dusty, non-clay litter. It‚Äôs very arid where I live, so don‚Äôt know if the dust and the static is messing up the sensors. I ordered some clumping grass litter that promised low dust, so we will see.

If I am going to spend 5+ minutes every day troubleshooting a litter box, I might as well just use a normal litter box and save $650. Daily scooping only takes a minute. I am still in the 90 day trial window, so if the less dusty litter doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs going back. I am out of ideas."
"Disabling motion sensor(s) on Litter Robot 4?I have a long haired car that sheds a lot, and his hair constantly gets on and in the motion sensor which causes it to pause mid-clean cycle multiple times per day. 

Today while out Christmas shopping it paused, and we came home to poop on the carpet because it was stuck in an unusable state. 

Is there any way to disable the motion sensor so it won‚Äôt get triggered by some stray hair? Or what else are my options to bypass it? I tried putting some tape over the sensors so hair couldn‚Äôt get in there but the lights just turn red and it doesn‚Äôt move at all. At this point the machine is worse than a standard litter box since at least we won‚Äôt come home to poop on the floor."
"My LR4 review never got published at litter-robot.comTitle: Disappointed, we'll keep it? temporary 2 stars.

10/02/2022 I must state that the unit is not that it doesn't worth it... IT DOESN'T WORTH IT FOR ME, but I also understand that this is not only about the money you invest on it but the convenience of having a constant clean sand for your cats which is a lot more hygienic for them, but also for you as well, removing the burden of keeping it clean by yourself, so... said that, I think there is a lot of people that put all these in weight, and at the end, this unit, good or bad, FOR ME, the brand is actually the best available, and this comment comes from my ACTUAL, LONG and PRIOR researches on the ""best"" units available,... unfortunately, well impressed with LR3, I missed reviews on LR4.  
This is my story... After looking at the operation of LR3 at a friend's home and listening to what amazing it is after one year of use and the well-constructed, thaaaaaat modern, slick and fancy look, I decided to go for it!,.. I thought, they both, Tobbi and Diego (4 YO and 5 Wo) worth it!... and even better... there is a new iteration of it with a bunch of new features with a tag of plus dollars as well of course!... anyways, I got it!  
It just arrived today and I'm incredible exited for it!!!......... :) :) :) :) :)  
First impression!..... Very nice packaging!...  
Aaaaaaad..... THAAAAATS IT!!!....... :( :( :( :(  
Weak, cheap construction and the worst quality control on the process and final product, gaps and uneven surfaces all over the parts' joints/edges.... huuuuugues!!!!, the waste drawer doesn't seal at all with a big gap and uneven edge running all the way along the bottom of it.... (for all of these, video available), I should've gotten a little bit more into reviews before this purchase, which is my way,... I was that impressed with the performance of LR3 though, that I didn't even though it twice..., my bad! ...  
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!...  
S E V E N H U N D R E D D O L L A R S!!!! FOR THIS!!!!...  
It really hurts!... this is not about the money expensed but the sense of being ripped off... I still don't believe it happened to me! For a THAAAAAT well established and THAAAAAT good, reputed business... shame on you!!!!!!  
But there is more!...  
Hidden information!... for the time being since arrival of the unit (several hours now), I have researched on specs not DIRECT available at advertising... and compared to LR3, the internal size of the globe is 2 INCHES shorter in depth, which added to the 1 inch (advertised) in width, leads to a significantly smaller volume for your cat to move around for its businesses, for which you need to take that in consideration for larger cats.... as mine :( :( :(.  
I still have 3 months ahead of me to test the operation of LR4, most likely I'll return it at the end of the home trial... at least, one needs some kind of satisfaction after the ""fiasco"", so I'll use LR4 for the full home trial, then to decide the road to follow, and in the meanwhile, I'll continue closely following up on the operation of the LR3, for which apparently, everybody is very, very satisfied with and while convinced, I think I'll get LR3 latter.  
I'll post an update in some weeks on following the operation of ""my"" LR4 that hopefully will be useful for any person interested on...  
Stars may go lower.? I don't think so after my research on ""reputed"" brands availabe... going the stars up, neither think so. The 2 stars now, account for the 100% satisfaction on operation that I foresee as positive after use in the following weeks, and mostly based on the current operation of the reputed LR3, FOR WHICH I DONT REALLY BELIEVE, the brad is going to put at risk after that many years of building it.... except for ""feel"", as cheap constructed, and ""look"", about those BIG and UNEVEN gaps and joints, and not the operation of the unfortunate LR4, which I insist, anticipate as totally satisfactory... We'll see................... 

12/20/2022 UPDATE

Firstly, 5 stars to customer support, if there was option to add more I would. No questions asked, I just explained my situation in few, jut few words, and they promptly responded offering a replacement unit right away, the only downside was having to wait more than an hour for somebody to pick up the call. The free replacement unit arrived in one week including return of the faulty one at no charge. Up and running again!!!! Just amazing!!!

All explained about the arrival of the first unit above. 

For more than a moth it operated as expected with minor issues mostly related to dust and hair? at the sensors, which I consider totally normal for the type of product and use, this is, litter, hairy family pets and movement, so I focused on 2-3 time a week for a quick cleaning at the sensor with a brush and some dry air, and no big deal, ready to go..... for few more weeks ony... then it stared to get stuck upside down and red leds at control panel, in both manual and automatic operation, the waste way facing the waste drawer, always in the same position, no matter what you do to try to resolve it, which is not that much... cleaning, thorough cleaning, power down and power back up, review for loose screws, reset to factory setting, unboarding (is this an actual english word?), resetting network... then, the worst... unresponsive control panel at any command. Is at this point that I decided to contact customer service; having a $700 DOLLARS unit just sitting there with no use, well, I just gave up and grabbed the phone, which I try to avoid at all cost (no matter the supplier, all of them) because usually they just go by the book, have no practical experience in their products and most of the time, I end up resolving the issues by myself. Case resolved immediately and I'm very satisfied... so far!...

I'm industrial Engineer and understand about production process and interactions of elements involved, bothn at technology development and actual production, and there is ALWAYS, always  room for error and faulty products, and that's why there are always WARRANTY linked to your acquisitions as well; no matter how expensive your Lamborghini is, IT MIGHT COME FAULTY... and it's expected that some of us will get it... well, this time it was me... not a Lamobirghini.... I wish!!!!.... just not there yet! . 

THE GOOD

\- One more star.... 3 now.... yeeeeeeeee!

\- Customer service. Thombs up!!!!!!!!!!!!

\- For BETTER or WORSE, and from many comments and reviews I've read for all those automatic litter boxes in the market, MY PERSONAL conclusion is that this is the best brand to stick with. This is an American company and you relay in their LOCAL support, repair and parts availability.... and no, this review is not sponsored, not looking for it, I'm just paying back to the community, that speaking out has led me to get the best products in the market, that's it.

\- Replacement unit a little bit better constructed, internal litter screen better fitted and tighter to the globe by the bottom edge, the faulty unit has it totally loose and never liked passing through some waste to the litter compartment while cycling, the globe lid better fitted as well with a tighter and easier locking/unlocking grasp.

\-  Looks like electronics still at pretty good level.

\- Wider opening to the globe, more comfortable for entering/exiting the globe.

\- Detection sensor for kittens and actual waste in the drawer.

\- Pets weight detection for health follow up.

\- More comprehensive app and app controls.

THE BAD

\- Cheap fabrication materials? Don't know, it could be the reason for contractions at cooling after casting, leading to all those big gaps at part's joints and external-bottom waste drawer unfitting/bad odor sealing, these are unacceptable for a company with this good reputation and expensive products.

\- Smaller internal globe than LR3, even LR3 is small in general, and I'd say, we family pet's owners want the best for our family, right? For the price, I think is possible to provide more comfort... and I also say we're willing to sacrifice some space in favor of them as well! which is not that much actually... when I see Tobi, our eldest at 4 YO, struggling to cover his ""gracias"" as we say in spanish, I just feel sad :( ... (there are several uses for the ""gracias"" word, not ""thank you"" only, it depends on what you're talking about).

THE UNKNOWN

\- Was the faulty one, just a random AND EXPECTED off in quality control? or it is actually a FLAW in the development of this iteration of the product that may lead to a total crash in the market?... I have read too many reviews and comments about LR4 and from that, I'm not conclusive yet.

\- For the good of my pets, I'll follow up with the operation of the unit and will attempt to continue posting updates."
"My LR3 motherboard fried...So I made my own instead.

**tl;dr:** Litter Robot 3 motherboard fried, decided to make my own instead. Was lots of fun *and* way cheaper, 10/10 would do it again. Code and schematics on github, link below.

---

So... One sorry day of December, 2021, my Litter Robot 3 started acting weird.

First, it gave me a fast-flashing blue light, switching to slow yellow when pressing Reset. Then it started to freeze at bootup on a solid yellow light - no amount of cleaning or making sure the connectors were all secure helped. Nor did sanding the pinch detector, either.

Unfortunately, at that moment, it was just out of warranty, so my only option was to buy a new motherboard, and those things are expensive.

It turns out, the Litter Robot 3 is made of pretty simple electronics. Hell, the ""CPU"" on there is a PIC 16F microcontroller. There had to be a way to get all this to work again.

So, here's how this fail-safe (/s) machine works :
 * The biggest part of it is a 12V motor + reduction gear set that rotates the drum back and forth (with the gearset making it slow, but super high torque)
 * The drum contains tiny neodymium magnets, triggering hall sensors that act as end stop switches
 * The ""cat sensor"" is a simple load-sensitive resistor
 * The pinch detector is a basic mechanical switch made of two metal pieces
 * The most complex part apart from the motherboard is the DFI sensor, which I haven't reimplemented yet but shouldn't be too much of an issue.

The parts most prone to fail in there are the motherboard and the DFI sensors, which in my opinion look *way* over-engineered. 

*Cue a side-look to an ESP32 board lying on my desk...*

With all that in mind, I settled to making my own alternative motherboard out of an ESP32. Since I'm not going to be using the stock motherboard's form factor, using the original button placements is out of the way.

All parts included, I was able to make my own for around $15. When I make a final PCB instead of the prototyping board I used it shouldn't exceed $20.

I decided to ditch buttons altogether instead, switching to a fully remote control via a web app served directly from the ESP32, allowing for much finer control over the litterbox's settings.

No more beating around the bush, here's [the GitHub repository to the whole thing](https://github.com/xtrium-lnx/litter-eater).

The repo contains the complete electronic schematics, full source code (using the Arduino IDE) with (some) documentation about how I implemented this... thing.

Here are the features it currently has :
 * Over-the-air updating for when I screw around with code / when more features come along
 * Capture portal to connect it to your home Wifi network
 * Full control over the timings, from the delay before sifting to overshooting endstops (either to make litter horizontal again or to help with dumping)
 * Makes your fried Litter Robot eat cat poop again :')

What's left to do :
 * Pinch detection
 * Drawer full detection
 * (Maybe) Cat detection depending on weight
 * Push notifications when your cats go in or when the drawer's full

Edit: added a few details about the webapp."
"Cycle Light Flashing Yellow RapidlyHi LitterRobot fam‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm kind of frustrated because the last couple of days my LitterRobot has been falsely triggering the ‚Äúfull‚Äù notification. The ‚Äúready‚Äù button would flash blue and I have gotten notifications on my app that the robot was full. I figured something was on the sensor so I wiped the sensors off tonight down in the litter tray compartment.

Now, the ‚Äúready‚Äù light flashes blue and when I press the reset button, the ‚Äúcycling‚Äù light flashes yellow/amber rapidly. I Googled this and seems to be an indicator that the weight or anti-pinch sensors are being tripped (based on the flashing yellow/amber ‚Äúcycling‚Äù light).

I unplugged the robot and disassembled and used a q-tip to swipe around the metal anti-pinch sensors to see if this might help clear the issue but it has not. It‚Äôs really nerve-wracking because this happened today and I have three cats who depend on using this to go to the restroom.

Any ideas, help, or insight someone can share? I‚Äôve NEVER had a problem until this and now I feel (dramatic-emphasis) hopeless! üòû"
"How long did it take to arrive?I‚Äôm sure this has been asked before but haven‚Äôt been able to find it. Also hoping for an up to date response. From the day you ordered, how many days did it take until you received your litter robot? We ordered the credenza, as well. I‚Äôm clearly impatient and sick of smelling poo! üòÇüòÖ TIA!"
"What to do when she‚Äôs in a cone?My baby girl is finally (hopefully) getting spayed next week after months of trying to figure out her chronic health issues before surgery.

She acclimated really well to the LR and she‚Äôs been using it for months now. But I‚Äôm working on getting her desensitized to a cone and it doesn‚Äôt seem to fit in the LR. I guess I should just break out her old litter box once she gets home from the procedure, and leave it uncovered. Are there any tips to this sort of... taking a break from the LR and then going back to it? (I‚Äôm in a small apartment and the litter box is in the living room so this is especially important to my roommates and me.)"
"Ramp / Other Accessories Necessary?I just got a 4 month old kitty and he's good to go with a normal litter box. I'm planning to get a Litter Robot after reading a ton of information.

He's going to be a bit floofy cat as he is a Siberian Forest Cat.

I'm putting it in a small laundry room (stacking my current washer / dryer) so it will be a pain to remove the ramp to empty the bin. How necessary would you say the ramp is? 

Also, any other accessory suggestions? It's expensive to order from these sites in Canada due to shipping so any help would be super appreciated. :)"
"Pinch Sensor / DFI issue - Please Help.Hey, so I have been troubleshooting an issue that started last night with my 14 month old LR3 that has a blinking blue light and when I press the reset blinks fast yellow. After research I found that this is most likely the dreaded bad DFI sensor. The problem I‚Äôm having is that I have to leave for work tomorrow morning for two days and I have two cats that depend on it so I‚Äôm looking for ways to resolve the issue even as a hack while the replacements come in. 

I have already tried the pinch sensor bypass and cleaning out the whole thing by taking it apart, both without luck  

Does anyone have any ideas that can help me out? Is there something that is known to go bad on the sensor that can be cleaned or re solder?"
"SuggestionI've been considering to buy a robot for a while now. But I'm still not convinced to make this investment. My requirement is for a litterbox that allows me to leave my cats alone for a short period of time. The litterboxes as their are now are perfect for one cat, ok for 2 but don't scale enough for more.

So I've been thinking that maybe for the next iteration of the product you can design it so that the litter container can be optionally bigger, maybe by swapping a ""default"" piece with a bigger one. That way one would be able to get the right size depending on how many pets he has.

Edit:

For instance, you could sell some aftermarket ""accessory"" or a variant of the base model that replaces the bottom drawer with a bigger one double the size. This in turn would make the unit taller (I guess a taller ladder accessory would be advisable then). Personally for this kind of product is not height but width and depth the limiting factors. And enlarging the drawer wouldn't add up to the surface. But having the option one would be free to trade size with capacity. As I said for one cat the product is already perfect as it is. Mine is just a wish for multi pet owners. I agree that poo shouldn't stay inside for longer than one week though (something less in summer). Just in case the app should just remind you that a clean up is advisable.

Edit 2:

Another idea for multi cat owners. Chip reader? One of my cats today had issues. Wouldn't be nice if you could know which one had to use it 4 times in 2 hours without being there watching?"
"Gravity Mode or Scheduled Feedings?Deciding how to use the Feeder-Robot depends on your pet‚Äôs eating habits. If your dog or cat has a habit of overeating or eating very quickly, you may wish to schedule your pet‚Äôs meals. By scheduling meals, your pet will be eating a measured amount, 1 to 8 times a day.

If your pet has no issue with overeating and tends to ‚Äúgraze‚Äù throughout the day (this is more likely with cats than dogs), you may wish to use Gravity Mode. In Gravity Mode, the Feeder-Robot Food Bowl remains full based on a check every 6 hours."
"What timing delay do you use?Understand it may be litter dependant, but I am curious what time settings most of you use.

What is the waste capacity of the L4 drawer?How much waste can the L4 drawer hold before it registers as full? I feel like mine registers full so quickly when there is so little waste. I can‚Äôt imagine they would design such a large drawer yet only allow minimal waste capacity. It feels inefficient and wasteful. Is this normal or is my sensor off?
I'd like to put my litter robot over a large trash can so that I almost never have to change it. Has anyone tried this?
"LR4s most undersold feature: redesigned waste bin = more useable capacityI have had our LR3 for nearly 3 years and been quite happy with it. We have 2 cats and with the LR3, I‚Äôd get 1.5-2 days out of the waste drawer before a full alert, and then I‚Äôd need to shake the waste bin a couple of times but ultimately only getting ~3.5 days between changing the trash bag (which I used in place of liners). 

With the LR4, I set it up and installed it on Sunday of this week (5 days ago!) and have yet to touch it. According to the app its 80% full. I took the drawer out and because of the increased height (overall volume may not be any bigger), the litter no longer mounds up triggering full alerts, it‚Äôs actually filling up the whole space. I‚Äôll probably get another day out of it.

Anyway, just wanted to share that because this is huge for me. Less time I have to deal with litter and helps make things easier when we are going to be gone for a few days. 

Of course, I had to put a couple of scoops of fresh litter in over the last 5 days but no big deal there IMO. :)

Obligatory not a Whisker shill. I paid for this with my own money."
"Is this a normal amount of waste for the drawer to be full in the LR4?This thing is driving me crazy with how often it says it's full since it stops cycling. We have 3 cats but it says it's full in less than 24 hours pretty often. At first, we thought it might be the Kitty Poo Club silica litter so we switched to the LR litter but the issue continues to persist. I zero it every time and have tried recalibrating but to no avail.
Picture here - https://imgur.com/a/C6zyybd
That is after doing 4 or 5 manual cycles while it thought it was full. Does this look right?
I feel like for a piece of tech this expensive, the app should let you set and change the capacity and adjust it when it's not actually full"
What features do you want to see added to the next generation of Litter Robot?
"I really hope the LR4 works..Hello!

I have been using LR3 since 2018. I loved the idea of it for our two cats. Well, I didn't realize it, but apparently somehow some urine got in between the globe and liner. I didn't know about it. I kept cleaning the globe, the tray, liner... everything with baking soda/vinegar, just white vinegar an water, and dawn dish soap. I kept smelling the box and I didn't understand.. this was months out. I then figured out the liner and globe were separate..

I had the extended warranty and  I explained the situation. CS was nice and sent out a brand new liner. I installed it and noticed a huge difference... and then it started getting smelly again. I'm pretty sure the smell has embedded in the plastic somehow... because it was so expensive, we just tried to clean it and change the liter as much as we can to help with the smell.

We then got another cat and the LR was getting full quick. We decided to buy a refurb LR3. (right before LR4 came out apparently) This has helped with the capacity problem. But no matter what I do, I smell cat urine. Ever since I was pregnant and had the baby, I feel my sense of smell has increased. Also, I've noticed unfortunately the smell is causing me to have headaches...

Before even thinking of buying another LR, we tried adding odor absorbers near the litter box, baking soda in the litter, changing the litter, adding scented trash can bags, changing the filter. I feel like it's a lost cause. And on top of that, they both are giving me rotation errors and things like that.

I did some research on the internet for automated litter boxes. There are a lot but unfortunately LR is still coming out as the best brand. 

I talked my hubby into getting an LR4. I'm really hoping this helps the problem especially since they added the odor thing on the back.

 Is the liner built into this LR the same as LR 3? It says on the website that it can handle up to 4 cats... does the drawer seem deeper for capacity?

&#x200B;

I really having high hopes for this. I've noticed that people are having issues but at the same time other people are not. I can only cross my fingers..."
"Elevation idea?So, after getting an LR3 second hand that one of our cats was terrified of, we bit the bullet and got an LR4.  Night and day difference for the cat.  Immediate adoption.  There have been some weird issues with connectivity and operation, but the last week or two it seems to have ironed itself out.  Part of those issues I think was the dog interrupting the cycle, which is why I am looking to elevate the unit.

But this also brings up my biggest complaint about the unit which is the abysmal bin size.  So, I was thinking about making a platform for it that houses a larger container for waste and Dremel'ing out the bottom of the unit for the waste to fall.  This would get the dog out of there and also increase capacity.  Has anyone tried something like this?"
"Litter Robot 4 Shipping Thread***Whisker put together a shipping estimate page on their website so this thread isn't really needed anymore. I'll still update this thread as long as people keep posting just in case but unless their estimates are way off I would just reference their post. I'll link both the post on their website and their Reddit post below.***

[Link to their website with shipping estimates.](https://support.litter-robot.com/s/lr4-delivery-schedule?language=en_US)

[Link to their Reddit post with shipping estimates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/wvwfcg/litterrobot_shipping_schedule_support_ticket/)

**TLDR & Whisker update in bold below**

*(Updated August 25th - 11:00 AM EST)*

In order to hopefully consolidate all the posts about shipping time inquiries (specifically for the black version but for the white version as well) people can just post here their model type, order dates, and shipping times.  Makes it way easier than digging through a ton of different threads and random posts to see if it should have shipped yet.

I'll keep the main TLDR section updated using comments from this thread daily until they're at least caught up and shipping same week.

I am also kindly asking people to stop bogging down Whiskers support staff with shipping notification inquiries as well, unless your order date range falls within the time it *should* have shipped.  This would help free up their staff to assist other customers with actual order, software, or hardware issues.  I know the delay is frustrating but unfortunately there isn't much anyone can do about it so it's best to just sit tight and wait!  There's no reason to go complain and yell at their support staff over something that's not their fault and they have no control over.

Regarding Shipping **-** If you're on vacation or out of town when it is scheduled to be delivered and you do not want it sitting on your front porch while you're gone you  can ask FedEx to hold onto your package for up to a 14 day period.

**UPDATE FROM WHISKER:**  *(from a response sent to* [HippyGroove](https://www.reddit.com/user/HippyGroove/) \- *7/28th)*

*""Thanks for contacting Whisker!*

*As we increased our manufacturing capacity for the Litter-Robot 4, we made the decision to add a texture to the exterior of the black Litter-Robot 4‚Äôs lower base and bonnet. This tooling change will improve the overall modern appearance of the unit while providing increased scratch resistance to the outer surface. As a result of this change we are running approximately three weeks behind on deliveries of black Litter-Robot 4 units. This will affect customers who ordered between May 17, 2022 and June 13, 2022. Rest assured, though, that your order is still prioritized in our queue based on your order date, and your new estimated ship date will be emailed to you.*

*If you did want to change to a white unit, we would need to cancel this order and have you place a new one in the white instead. Unfortunately that would start the lead time of 5-7 weeks over, though, so my advice would be to keep the black order. We are working to get those pushed out just as quickly as we can.*

*To thank you for your patience, and to show our appreciation for your support, we will be including a free gift with your order. This will be included in your Litter-Robot 4 box.""*

"LR4 Completely Broke after 2 WeeksIs anyone else having this issue or have solutions for it? I am beyond frustrated with my purchase of the LR4. Not only did it take 6 extra weeks to arrive after I was told with the pre-order that it would be here in July, but it only ""worked"" for about two weeks. While it worked it was great, but that was very short lived. After those two weeks I have been faced constantly with the solid red bar and notifications such as ""cat sensor fault"" ""cycle interrupted"" ""cycle paused"" and there is nothing blocking the sensors, no cat in the litter box, nothing. I have tried calling the company, their phones are shut down due to high volume of calls, I have tried emailing the company only to not get a response, I have tried the chat function that is pushed so hard, and it never works, I have even tried contacting them on Instagram to be met only with automated responses, now I‚Äôm trying Reddit, maybe I‚Äôll have better luck? I have done everything possible listed under troubleshooting for the LR4: cleaning the sensors, emptying the entire thing, resetting the system by pushing down the reset and connect until it turns off then wait two minutes then turn back on, removing the globe to empty and clean it, I have tried everything. Nothing works. It may ""fix"" the issue for 30 seconds, only for it to start cycling and then proceed to have a cat sensor failure and then stops completely while the globe is all the way upside down. For obvious reasons, my cats can't use the litter box when the litter is covered and it is stuck ""emptying"" and I'm getting tired of my hardwood floors getting ruined because they are going to the bathroom outside of the litter box because it consistently doesn't work. I am very upset, frustrated, disappointed in the fact that I spent so much money on what came highly recommended to me, only to be met with so many problems and no solutions. I'm not sure what else to do since I am not receiving communication back in any capacity. The entire thing doesn‚Äôt work anymore whatsoever. üòï"
"LR4- How does it calculate drawer space used / remaining?I received my LR4 this week and my cat is in the ""ring and run"" stage where she hops in and out of the box several times a day but doesn't actually use it.   History shows 19 cleaning cycles run and 25% of the drawer capacity currently full...but opening the drawer reveals only about a shot glass worth of individual clean litter pieces that have accumulated.  Does the LR4 calculate drawer capacity used with a weight sensor (if so, do I likely have an issue?), is it simply doing math (every cycle uses X% drawer capacity?), or is there another way its calculating capacity used?"
"Help with the world‚Äôs most robot spoiled catWe have a cat that has only known the litter robot experience in his life, in a 2 cat household.

About a month ago, he started to pee on the floor if the litterbox is not perfectly clean. We put a camera in the room to identify which cat it was and to try and see if there are health issues.

What we found is that if it isn‚Äôt 100% clean, he will look inside the box and then pee on the floor. Mostly this happens if the capacity has just recently been reached (we would then swap the bag that night) but we have also seen it happen if his brother just used it and the timer is waiting to cycle that usage. 

I know that an unacceptably clean litter box can cause cats to do this, but his bar of ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù seems to be far too low because of his litter robot spoiled life. Does anyone have tips for this problem?"
"How long before having to empty?-LR4I‚Äôve had my LR4 set up for 5 full days. 
It‚Äôs currently reading at 55% full. 
I have 2 13lb cats. 
I‚Äôm pretty impressed so far with its capacity. 
How long are all you going before having to empty the bin?

Edit: day 7 @ 75%"
"Best litter for odor control/strong clumping/ doesn‚Äôt attract bugs?One of my cats is very sensitive to smells and will poop outside if he feels it‚Äôs too smelly near the litter box. 

I‚Äôve tried regular clay litter ( tidy cats) and noticed that it‚Äôs not the best at clumping although it was probably the better odor control litter i‚Äôve used. I absolutely LOVED the clumping capacity that Sustainably Yours/Garfield litter provided but unfortunately since it‚Äôs corn and cassava based it attracted nats every single time and had a very unpleasant odor. 

Any suggestions? 

Ps. I do change the carbon filters every so often."

Can I safely use an extension cord?I emailed customer support but no answer. Is it safe to keep my LR permanently plugged into an extension cord? I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out the power usage and what it means in terms of not exceeding capacity and causing a fire hazard.
"Just got off the phone with support--I'm scheduled to get my 3rd LR4 (2nd replacement). Heed my advice.I don't know why it happens, and I don't know how to fix it (if there is an engineer out there who has reverse-engineered their LR4 and can share some information, I would love to hear from you), but these LR4's seem to work fine immediately out of the box, for a couple of months, and then the issues start to appear. This first replacement unit (2nd LR4) that I have now, I literally placed it on my level, flat, hardwood floor back in February of this year, and I haven't moved it until yesterday when the errors became intolerable. After my experience with my first LR4 unit that I received in the fall of 2022, I knew not to fall prey to hopeful, wishful thinking that the LR4 will just magically start to work properly. This time, I only tolerate ONE cat-shit-outside-the-LR4-on-the-floor-mat, not multiple cat shits on the floor and cat pees on my living room couch like I did over the 2022-2023 winter season. No, f\*\*\* that. I took it into my garage and spent about 6 hours cleaning and troubleshooting, to no success. My LR4 gets stuck at the exact same spot mid-cycle, and there is no way to continue or cancel the cycle using any combination of button-pushes and power-cycles. Once it gets to this one spot mid-cycle, the only way for me to get it back to the home position is to take the bonnet off and manually rotate the globe with my hands.

I don't understand how this company could be so irresponsible and careless. I'm about to receive my third LR4 unit. Third! Whisker must be losing money from this LR4 product... and if they're not, then that thing must be sooooo overpriced that the cost to produce must be close to $50, and the remaining $650 goes to funding all the customer support, tech support, shipping and handling, replacement units, etc.

Why the f\*\*\* didn't this company perform thorough product testing and R&D before releasing this product? And, if they did, and they knew this product was faulty when they released it, then why did they go ahead with the release? Why would the CEO decide to release a bad product and upset a large subset of Whisker's customers?

&#x200B;

My advice to any new LR4 owners is as follows: **do not tolerate the solid-red-lights cycle interruptions.** If your cat(s) is(are) anything like mine, then they probably don't poke their head into the unit while the damn thing is rotating. Most cats, I think, won't do that, because they're literally scaredy-cats. Especially do NOT tolerate solid-red-light cycle interruptions that are difficult or impossible to clear by some combination of button-presses and/or power-cycling the unit. You can try cleaning it, but if you've owned it for at least 1 or 2 months and you start to get these cycle interruptions then it's probably not because of dirt and debris (unless yours is really, really dirty). Do **not** hope and pray that these faults go away. Just pick up the LR4, bring it into your garage or some place where you can troubleshoot it, put out an ol'fashioned litter box for your cat(s), and try to get your damned LR4 to work PROPERLY and CONSISTENTLY. Try to get it to consistently cycle without any interruptions, and don't put it back to use until you are satisfied! Otherwise, you'll probably come home to a pile of cat crap and/or piss because your LR4 got stuck mid-cycle and your cat(s) had nowhere to go #2.

We paid $700 for a big hunk of plastic, a motor, some sensors, and some circuitry. We paid $700 for a product that WORKS, not one that will unexpectedly stop working while you're at work so your cat will ruin your $2000 couch!! We deserve more than that for $700.

Let's say you would otherwise spend 3 minutes, every day, scooping cat litter. After 90 days (the approximately lifetime of these LR4 units, in my experience), that cumulative time is 4.5 hours. Given the $700 that you paid to not have to do all the scooping, that's an hourly rate of $155 per hour."
"No recent activity ?After months of stellar performance - all of a sudden, the app keeps saying no recent activity and I noticed today that the LR4 hadn‚Äôt  cycled after the cats used it! - and it must have been all day because it was turd central.

Anyone know anything about this tomfoolery????"

"ExquisiCat Micro Crystals Clumping for LR3?Hi! I typically use the Target brand clumping clay litter but recently the large bucket as been hard to find in my area. I've tried all the other recommended brands by people in this sub and I haven't found one I like as much as the cheap target one LOL I find it preforms just as well as some of the more expensive brands for like half the price. 

I was thinking of trying the Petsmart brand litter and then the clumping micro crystals caught my attention and I was wondering if anyone on this sub uses it? It's pretty expensive for a 7 pound bag compared to clay litter, so I just wanted to get some opinions before I try it out. [This](https://www.petsmart.com/cat/litter-and-waste-disposal/litter/exquisicat-micro-crystals-clumping-multi-cat-silica-cat-litter---unscented-low-dust-30687.html?cgid=200152&fmethod=Browse) is the one I was looking at."
"Litter robot 4 vs Leo's loo too early thoughtsLittle background on two cats I have :

I am new to automatic litter solution since my first 6 year old cat (Sphynx ) liked to use our toilet since she was 4 months old. I only started to appreciate how smart she is when we got another kitten which does not have the same level of intelligence. So after three attempts to train the new cat and finding shit all over my house I gave up. Here come robots.

Purchased Leo's loo too a month ago. Both of my cats started using it from the moment I turned it on. I was not concerned with the smart one since she obviously prefer sand over toilet seat. The new cat also is using it without any issues. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them take a shit and get notifications on it for some odd reason. More on that later. A month in on it, the core function of this robot works as advertised. I mean not a single snag. I have yet to clean it or change the litter in it. The weight function is spotty and not reliable enough to tell the difference between the two cats. They have 4 pound difference and I still can't really tell who went for it.  That's about it.  The only issue was that I had Leo's loo too on the second floor of my house and my cats had second litter box on the first floor. Solution was to get another toy for me and my cats. So obvious choice is to get the same Leos loo too robot and add it on my app. However, Robot 4 adds few more interesting features which Leo does not. I was still concerned about all the reported issues litter robot 4 users had with hardware and software. I still went for it given that Whisker has 90 days return policy and I can send it back.

So I ordered Litter robot 4. for those who are interested , Whisker (Litter -Robot 4 ) had 3-5 day shipping on their site at the time of the order. It ended up being 7 days till it was delivered.

Opened it up and went through the set up within few minutes. Both cats yet again took immediate interest and both relieved themselves in the orderly fashion. No burn in period at all. Both dropped the Duce right away.

I own Leos loo too for a month. I have Litter robot for few days.

Features which **Robot 4** has an upper leg on Leo's loo too:

A. Dumping old sand into the waist bin. This is a big one since you would have to drag Leo;s globe out and find creative way to get rid of the litter without making a mess. While setting up I had to dump clean litter and saw this feature worked perfectly. That's a win for Robot 4.

B. Bigger opening to get in and out - looks like they don't seem to mind jumping in smaller or bigger opening.

C. Waist bin level monitoring - so far it is showing accurate level. Leo's loo does not have that option.

Features which **Leo's loo too** has over Robot 4

UV light  - It is too early to tell how Robot 4 will perform in the smell department , but Leos loo too does not smell at all even with the full bin of waist. It actually smells like an expensive air freshener.  I don't know if it's a UV light that controls the oder so well or/and the design which isolates waist bin from the globe's opening. I mean I could have put it in the kitchen next to the dining table and still be happy with it. I will wait for a month and update this thread on the smell situation for Robot 4.

&#x200B;

Issues so far :

Leo's loo too - none

Robot 4  - as I took that thing out of the box and went through the first few cleaning cycles, I did face an issue with the hard clicking sound. Felt like a mechanical issue with the rotation mechanism. I was laughing that it had to happen on the first day given all the reviews I have read prior to ordering it.

Someone else had the same issue here : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV\_hVTHRw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV_hVTHRw)

So I did some quick research and it ended up being a small issue with the fence causing friction and coming into contact with the plastic piece on the globe while it is rotating during cleaning cycle. I posted my solution here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking\_sound\_when\_rotating\_lr\_4/jcqbxby/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking_sound_when_rotating_lr_4/jcqbxby/?context=3)

Not sure if it is a positive point, but robot 4 has ton of support discussions online. I feel like most of the issues will be easy to find and resolve them on your own. Not so much for Leo's loot too. I don't think Leo's loo too is just perfect and hence has no wide issues coverage online. It may be just a much newer product.

Missing function on both Robots: Email notification/ SMS

\- My boss made fun of me for buying robot and not scooping the old fashion way. He is usually on my case for buying too many tech gadgets. I only told him about one robot btw. So I have been taking screenshots of push notifications on my cat's bowel movement activity and sending it to him via text message. Wish there was an email/sms solution so I can automate this task.

I will update again in few months."
litter recommendationshi! i‚Äôm planning on buying a litter robot 4 soon and was just wondering if anybody had any litter recommendations for optimal performance?
"Constant issues with LR4 Please helpUpdate- I contacted support through their website because the click here link in the app wasn't clickable... Anyways they replied pretty quick and are sending a replacement base.  

I got the Litter robot 4 about a month ago and at first loved it.  I was hesitant to buy it based on the price but kept reading story after story of how great it is and figured I'd give it a try.  we have 4 cats and the youngest 2 took to it fairly quickly and with the exception of them constantly sticking their heads in when it was cycling causing it pause repeatedly, it seemed to work flawlessly.  

about a week later, all 4 cats have adjusted to it but now we start to have the same issues over and over.  One problem is that it constantly reports full after ever cleaning cycle.  with a fresh liner in place(and they are the LR4 liners) we might get one cleaning cycle where it doesn't report being full but by the second cleaning cycle it's flashing full.  during the day it's not as big a deal to be hitting the cancel button after each cycle, but overnight is always a problem and when we get up in the morning and cycle it, when the litter falls(usually heavy clumps) the unit stops and the light goes solid red.  this has been the second issue that is making me regret this purchase.  you can't cancel the red light like you can when it detects a cat.  the unit becomes frozen and nothing fixes it.  I tried unplugging it for a minute and then plugging back in and it goes through it's initial light sequences and then stops with a half green half red light bar.  ultimately the only way I can get it working again is by removing the bonnet and manually returning the globe to the start position.  I've been doing that multiple times a day and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't paid $700.  

I have researched all the tips and solutions and nothing works more than a day most.  we have it on a hardwood floor, level, not on a rug, not touching any walls.  I have removed the globe and cleaned out any stray litter. I have cleaned the sensors with a dry rag.  I have made sure the liners are on tight and not sticking out where they can get caught.  I also installed the newest firmware this week without any improvement.  I want to love this thing but all I'm feeling is buyer's remorse."
"Firmware questionMy LR4 luckily has had no real issues in the 4 months ish that I have had it . Seeing the non stop posts about issues has me wondering if I should just avoid any software updates since mine is working pretty much flawlessly.

I guess this is more for the litterrobot team but are there any downsides of me not doing software updates ? Will there come a time when the jump between versions is too big and will cause issues ? Currently it performs as advertised so I‚Äôm reluctant to do any upgrades.

Currently on;

"Designed by Dog owners. Tested by humans. Intended for Cats.  

**The Litter Robot 4**

*Designed by Dog owners.* *Tested by humans.* *Intended for Cats.*

Things I have learned while owning my Litter Robot 4.

Getting it out of the box it came in was a chore. The hood kept popping loose. I would think the hood would be better connected to the rim. My very first impression was how cheap it seemed that the hood wasn‚Äôt firmly connected to the rest of the machine. I had the sinking feeling that I had just spent $700 on a piece of cheap plastic.

After unpacking the Robot and placing it near the old litter box, I started to use the android app. The very first thing the app asks for is for me to scan the Q code. I thought, ‚ÄòWell, this sucks. The code is on the back of the Robot and at the bottom. Now I have to turn it around, tilt it up with one hand and try to scan the code with my other hand. Whose bright idea was it to put the Q code in the most inaccessible location?‚Äô I finally gave up and just scanned the code on the box it came in. 

I buy litter in a box so filling the Robot from the box was a no-go. The box was too big to fit into the opening of the Robot. I had to find a scoop and cut open the whole top of the box the litter came in and scoop the litter into the Robot. I guess the Robot designers think everyone buys litter in a small 5-pound bag. 

So, the Robot is in place, the app is set up and it has the right amount of litter. I put a small amount of litter from the old box into the Robot so the cats would get the idea that this is another place/new place for them to go. Now the cats, being cats, begin to investigate this new thing in their world. 

My younger cat (just a few months old) seems to be having fun jumping in and out of the Robot. This causes the Robot to go nuts because its sensors keep detecting an interruption. So, I spend half the day pressing the Reset button on the cowling of the Robot. Of course, this would have been MUCH easier if the app had a Reset button. But hey, I guess the designers were dog owners.

Both cats easily adapted to using the Robot. However, like before, they were fascinated by the motion and no matter which setting I put the Robot on, they kept interrupting the cycle. I spend a lot of my time getting up, walking over to the Robot and pressing the Reset button over and over again to get it to the proper setting.

I actually caught both my cats looking at the Robot, then one would go in and use it, then jump out and they both waited for it to cycle, and then they put their paws on the step and stuck their heads inside. Again, causing an interrupt. This happened every single time they used the Robot. It seemed like they were playing a game with the Robot. Jump in, poop or pee, jump out, wait for it to move then stick their head inside and it stops. Wow! What fun!

This would not have been a big deal if the idiots that designed the app had put a reset button on the app. But nooooo. I had to get up every five minutes, walk over to the Robot and press the Reset button repeatedly to get it back to the proper position. Now I‚Äôm beginning to think that I just got scammed into spending a ton of money on a cat toy.

At this point, I should probably point out that I‚Äôm a Senior with mobility problems so walking is difficult. Getting up every time my cats interrupt the Robot‚Äôs cleaning cycle is a real pain. Literally.  It hurts when I walk so it is a literal pain to have to constantly have to get up and go press the Reset button on the Robot. Boy, the simple solution would have been to just put a damn Reset button on the app. But I guess the geniuses that designed the Robot are dog owners.

About the only thing good about the Litter Robot 4 so far is that I only have to empty the bag that traps the waste instead of scooping my old box. Which is better. I guess. But I only scooped the old box once a day. Now I have to get up and walk over to the Robot every 5-10 minutes and press the Reset button. And, I‚Äôm out $700 bucks.

Time will tell if my cats loose interest in the movement of the Robot and stop interrupting the cleaning cycle. If that happens, I can see where the Robot could work as advertised. And boy do they advertise. Looks like most of that $700 cost is spent on advertising.

I‚Äôm no design engineer. I‚Äôm just an old hippie with mobility problems and two cats that I love. The concept of a self-cleaning litter box is great. It‚Äôs just too bad that this one wasn‚Äôt designed and tested by cat owners. There is a very obvious problem with the sensors and how they control the Robot. The sensors are WAY too sensitive. And the reset function should reset the cycle to its default position with one press of the button. Not multiple presses of the button.

It‚Äôs painfully obvious that there should be a reset button on the android app. An even better solution would be to replicate the five buttons on the Robot cowling in the app. All the other info the app provides is cool, but it lacks true functionality that could help the user. The app is basically all sizzle and no steak.

Maybe it would help if I understood exactly how the Robot worked. Like where exactly are the sensors? On the step or inside the Robot? If the sensors are on the step, that‚Äôs a stupid place because the cats can interrupt the cycle just by putting their paws on the step to see what‚Äôs happening. If the sensors are inside the Robot, then they should only activate if a cat is detected for a longer period of time. That would eliminate the ‚Äòcurious cat‚Äô cycle interruptions.

If the sensors are in both the step and inside the Robot, then the sensors on the step should only be for detecting the cat‚Äôs weight and have nothing to do with the actual cleaning cycle. If the purpose of the ‚Äòinterrupt‚Äô in the cycle is to prevent injury to the cat, that‚Äôs silly because I assure you that as soon as the Robot starts turning they will jump out. A cat would never just sit there and take a ride. A dog might, but never a cat.

Speaking of the Reset function, it should perform a COMPLETE reset with one push of the button. Every time I have had to use the Reset button, I had to press it multiple times to get it back to its starting position. Why? One would think that a Reset button would *actually re-set* the Robot to its starting position. Not to mention that when I have to use the Reset button, my cats come running to watch the Robot do its thing. This often causes another interruption, which requires another press of the Reset button. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.

Overall, I‚Äôd have to say the advertising for the Litter Robot presents you with a fairy tale. The manufacturer wants you to think that you just plop this thing on the floor and magically your cats will use it the way the designers intended. This is false advertising and anyone that buys one of these things will probably agree that it was designed by dog owners, tested by humans and intended for cats. That‚Äôs a scary thought.

All of this is too bad since a good, well thought-out self-cleaning letter box would be a great invention for both cats and cat owners. You would think that if humans could work out how to go to the moon and back safely, we could crack the self-cleaning litter box dilemma. Too bad cat owners can‚Äôt design, build and test one using their own cats. I‚Äôm sure that together, they could figure it out.

Whiskers Support tried to update the firmware in my Robot to reduce the false interrupt problems but they couldn‚Äôt do it remotely. So, they are shipping me a new base which I will have to install myself. Can‚Äôt wait for that journey. We‚Äôll see if I can do it and how difficult it will be. Then there‚Äôs the whole process of boxing up the old base and dealing with a FedEx pickup. Oh joy."
"Yet another LR4 disappointmentI have had nothing but trouble with my Litter Robot 4 since it arrived. I was super excited about this product, and after a little less than two months I have found myself thoroughly frustrated with it and will be returning it. The two main issues I am having:

\- It always gets stuck in the cleaning cycle, and manual intervention is needed daily. I have followed the troubleshooting guide and all advice I could find with no improvement in functionality.

\- Pee pools in the tray area as well as inside the base/under globe area.

I spend more time troubleshooting and cleaning the LR4 daily than I did cleaning a traditional litter box. What pushed me over the limit was it getting stuck while I had a catsitter recently - she followed all my advice and looked up troubleshooting techniques on her own, and still could not get it to complete a cycle. She had to go out and buy a traditional litter box instead. 

I'm honestly baffled that \~$700 product is sold with potential for such poor functionality. Yes, there are many people who have functioning units and I wish that I had the experience those people, however the amount of people who have faulty ones or have to spend their time cleaning or troubleshooting their LRs just so it performs its basic functions is ridiculous.

I have initiated the return process and have ordered a roll-over style litter-box instead."
Performed a reset and now the cycle light stays on always‚Ä¶. Any ideas what could cause this ?
"Want to love this so much, but totally frustrated and unsure how to proceed from here - Litter Robot 4We bought the litter robot 4 and waited a few months for its delivery (it arrived ~September 10 2022).  Initially we had a few hiccups with cycles completing, but all were solved with wiping the sensors and/or resetting by unplugging it. 

Now, we are at errors listed as a motor fault and/or torque error that are not solved by resetting nor solved by performing the maintenance recommended by the litter robot website. Our litter robot will not cycle at all anymore. 

We are at our wits end as the holidays approach and we don‚Äôt have a litter solution at all. I‚Äôm back to scooping litter daily with no end in sight. Does anybody have any suggestions? I can upload a video if needed."
"Release notes for LR4 new firmware that came in the last few days?Hi, I noticed today there is new firmware waiting for my LR4.  Here is a screenshot from my app showing my current versions of my equipment.

I always like to know first what the release notes show before I perform the firmware updates.

Thank you in advance!

"LR3 Connect Not Connecting To WiFiAnyone have a model beginning with LR3C0 & been able to connect to the Whiskers app? It was working as expected, but now it is stuck searching for the network connection for 15+ minutes. 

I‚Äôve performed the basic troubleshooting steps. Any advice on what to do? I‚Äôve read online and it seems the only option is to ask support team to send you a wifi upgrade kit. They retail for ~$100, I‚Äôm not eager to spend more money especially since there‚Äôs built in wifi."
"My LR4 review never got published at litter-robot.comTitle: Disappointed, we'll keep it? temporary 2 stars.

10/02/2022 I must state that the unit is not that it doesn't worth it... IT DOESN'T WORTH IT FOR ME, but I also understand that this is not only about the money you invest on it but the convenience of having a constant clean sand for your cats which is a lot more hygienic for them, but also for you as well, removing the burden of keeping it clean by yourself, so... said that, I think there is a lot of people that put all these in weight, and at the end, this unit, good or bad, FOR ME, the brand is actually the best available, and this comment comes from my ACTUAL, LONG and PRIOR researches on the ""best"" units available,... unfortunately, well impressed with LR3, I missed reviews on LR4.  
This is my story... After looking at the operation of LR3 at a friend's home and listening to what amazing it is after one year of use and the well-constructed, thaaaaaat modern, slick and fancy look, I decided to go for it!,.. I thought, they both, Tobbi and Diego (4 YO and 5 Wo) worth it!... and even better... there is a new iteration of it with a bunch of new features with a tag of plus dollars as well of course!... anyways, I got it!  
It just arrived today and I'm incredible exited for it!!!......... :) :) :) :) :)  
First impression!..... Very nice packaging!...  
Aaaaaaad..... THAAAAATS IT!!!....... :( :( :( :(  
Weak, cheap construction and the worst quality control on the process and final product, gaps and uneven surfaces all over the parts' joints/edges.... huuuuugues!!!!, the waste drawer doesn't seal at all with a big gap and uneven edge running all the way along the bottom of it.... (for all of these, video available), I should've gotten a little bit more into reviews before this purchase, which is my way,... I was that impressed with the performance of LR3 though, that I didn't even though it twice..., my bad! ...  
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!...  
S E V E N H U N D R E D D O L L A R S!!!! FOR THIS!!!!...  
It really hurts!... this is not about the money expensed but the sense of being ripped off... I still don't believe it happened to me! For a THAAAAAT well established and THAAAAAT good, reputed business... shame on you!!!!!!  
But there is more!...  
Hidden information!... for the time being since arrival of the unit (several hours now), I have researched on specs not DIRECT available at advertising... and compared to LR3, the internal size of the globe is 2 INCHES shorter in depth, which added to the 1 inch (advertised) in width, leads to a significantly smaller volume for your cat to move around for its businesses, for which you need to take that in consideration for larger cats.... as mine :( :( :(.  
I still have 3 months ahead of me to test the operation of LR4, most likely I'll return it at the end of the home trial... at least, one needs some kind of satisfaction after the ""fiasco"", so I'll use LR4 for the full home trial, then to decide the road to follow, and in the meanwhile, I'll continue closely following up on the operation of the LR3, for which apparently, everybody is very, very satisfied with and while convinced, I think I'll get LR3 latter.  
I'll post an update in some weeks on following the operation of ""my"" LR4 that hopefully will be useful for any person interested on...  
Stars may go lower.? I don't think so after my research on ""reputed"" brands availabe... going the stars up, neither think so. The 2 stars now, account for the 100% satisfaction on operation that I foresee as positive after use in the following weeks, and mostly based on the current operation of the reputed LR3, FOR WHICH I DONT REALLY BELIEVE, the brad is going to put at risk after that many years of building it.... except for ""feel"", as cheap constructed, and ""look"", about those BIG and UNEVEN gaps and joints, and not the operation of the unfortunate LR4, which I insist, anticipate as totally satisfactory... We'll see................... 

12/20/2022 UPDATE

Firstly, 5 stars to customer support, if there was option to add more I would. No questions asked, I just explained my situation in few, jut few words, and they promptly responded offering a replacement unit right away, the only downside was having to wait more than an hour for somebody to pick up the call. The free replacement unit arrived in one week including return of the faulty one at no charge. Up and running again!!!! Just amazing!!!

All explained about the arrival of the first unit above. 

For more than a moth it operated as expected with minor issues mostly related to dust and hair? at the sensors, which I consider totally normal for the type of product and use, this is, litter, hairy family pets and movement, so I focused on 2-3 time a week for a quick cleaning at the sensor with a brush and some dry air, and no big deal, ready to go..... for few more weeks ony... then it stared to get stuck upside down and red leds at control panel, in both manual and automatic operation, the waste way facing the waste drawer, always in the same position, no matter what you do to try to resolve it, which is not that much... cleaning, thorough cleaning, power down and power back up, review for loose screws, reset to factory setting, unboarding (is this an actual english word?), resetting network... then, the worst... unresponsive control panel at any command. Is at this point that I decided to contact customer service; having a $700 DOLLARS unit just sitting there with no use, well, I just gave up and grabbed the phone, which I try to avoid at all cost (no matter the supplier, all of them) because usually they just go by the book, have no practical experience in their products and most of the time, I end up resolving the issues by myself. Case resolved immediately and I'm very satisfied... so far!... 

CONLCUSIONS

I'm industrial Engineer and understand about production process and interactions of elements involved, bothn at technology development and actual production, and there is ALWAYS, always  room for error and faulty products, and that's why there are always WARRANTY linked to your acquisitions as well; no matter how expensive your Lamborghini is, IT MIGHT COME FAULTY... and it's expected that some of us will get it... well, this time it was me... not a Lamobirghini.... I wish!!!!.... just not there yet! . 

THE GOOD

\- One more star.... 3 now.... yeeeeeeeee!

\- Customer service. Thombs up!!!!!!!!!!!!

\- For BETTER or WORSE, and from many comments and reviews I've read for all those automatic litter boxes in the market, MY PERSONAL conclusion is that this is the best brand to stick with. This is an American company and you relay in their LOCAL support, repair and parts availability.... and no, this review is not sponsored, not looking for it, I'm just paying back to the community, that speaking out has led me to get the best products in the market, that's it.

\- Replacement unit a little bit better constructed, internal litter screen better fitted and tighter to the globe by the bottom edge, the faulty unit has it totally loose and never liked passing through some waste to the litter compartment while cycling, the globe lid better fitted as well with a tighter and easier locking/unlocking grasp.

\-  Looks like electronics still at pretty good level.

\- Wider opening to the globe, more comfortable for entering/exiting the globe.

\- Detection sensor for kittens and actual waste in the drawer.

\- Pets weight detection for health follow up.

\- More comprehensive app and app controls.

THE BAD

\- Cheap fabrication materials? Don't know, it could be the reason for contractions at cooling after casting, leading to all those big gaps at part's joints and external-bottom waste drawer unfitting/bad odor sealing, these are unacceptable for a company with this good reputation and expensive products.

\- Smaller internal globe than LR3, even LR3 is small in general, and I'd say, we family pet's owners want the best for our family, right? For the price, I think is possible to provide more comfort... and I also say we're willing to sacrifice some space in favor of them as well! which is not that much actually... when I see Tobi, our eldest at 4 YO, struggling to cover his ""gracias"" as we say in spanish, I just feel sad :( ... (there are several uses for the ""gracias"" word, not ""thank you"" only, it depends on what you're talking about).

THE UNKNOWN

\- Was the faulty one, just a random AND EXPECTED off in quality control? or it is actually a FLAW in the development of this iteration of the product that may lead to a total crash in the market?... I have read too many reviews and comments about LR4 and from that, I'm not conclusive yet.

\- For the good of my pets, I'll follow up with the operation of the unit and will attempt to continue posting updates."
"Litter Robot 4 Phantom CyclingHi, before I reached out to LR support I wanted to see if the community had a suggestion for my issue. I got a LR4 about a month ago. Worked perfectly for the first 2-3 weeks. More recently it has been detecting a cat and cycling even when nothing happened. Often it will cycle, detect a cat again, cycle again etc.

&#x200B;

I've double checked no objects are touching the litter robot on the outside. Cleaned the sensors at the top of the entrance. Removed and re-attached the bonnet. Power cycled the device and even performed firmware updates. Does anyone else have suggestions before I reach out to support? If it matters here's the firmware version:

&#x200B;

ESP Firmware 1.1.54

PIC Firmware: 10512.2560.2.66

TOF Firmware 4.0.65.4"
"LR4 issues with scale and nightlightI just received my new LR4 yesterday, and I'm mostly thrilled. My cat started using it almost immediately with no encouragement, and it performs its main function of cleaning the litter flawlessly. So far, so good! However, there are two annoying issues that I can't solve:

1. The SmartScale in the app always shows 0.0 lbs. I've tried updating the firmware, power-cycling the unit, and pressing the reset button multiple times. I've seen in another post that the scale doesn't work great on carpet, and yes, my unit is on carpet. I will buy an 18"" circle of wood from Home Depot as suggested. But if that's really the issue, shouldn't it show SOME weight rather than 0? It always shows ""Cat Detected"" in the app history when my cat enters, and it always initiates a cleaning cycle 5 minutes after he exits, so it's definitely detecting a weight change. So why does it consistently show 0.0 lbs? Seems like there's something other than the carpet issue here.

2. I can't get the nightlight to turn on, no matter what I do. I've tried both Auto and On settings in the app, and all three brightness settings (Low, Medium, High) ‚Äî no dice. Am I doing something wrong, or did I receive a bad unit?

Thanks for any insight!"
"Litter Robot 4 - Litter sticking and clumping to center silicone?Hello!

I've had the LR4 for about 3 weeks now and its fantastic. I have two cats, one normal and one with excessive drinking and urination problems due to early feline leukemia brain damage (both stray kittens I found in my cabbage patch).

Currently, I am using the base litter that comes from Whisker. I tried using the Arm and Hammer Glide litter that came highly recommended on the litter compatibility post, but in my experience it created excessive sticky clumps that adhered to the silicon litter mat in the globe. The 'Whisker' litter performs much better, but I still experience sticking clumps in the very center of the silicone portion. 

Does anyone else experience a similar problem? Any other solutions? Currently, I use 15 minutes as the cycle time and remove the globe for cleaning every two weeks - spot clean every other day roughly.

I should also mention this is my first time using clumping litter so not much experience with the products and their ingredient makeups."
"New LR4 stuck blinking between red and green on the light bar, not working at all.Hey folks, just recently got the LR4 delivered a couple days ago and it's unfortunately been nothing but issues. When powered on, it will perform the clean cycle per normal but I have already noticed plastic rubbing I'm assuming between the globe and bonnet. The big issue is that the LR4 will not actually work beyond that initial cleaning cycle.

The light bar just perpetually flashes between green and red and I don't even see anything on their support page about what this is supposed to mean. Troubleshooting it myself, I noticed that if I press down on the bonnet with force, it will eventually turn blue and seem to be working but as soon as it detects any movement and turns red, it will either stay red permanently or will eventually start flashing red and green again.

I'm guessing the CATS sensor is busted in mine but was wondering if there were any additional troubleshooting steps I can take while I wait for Whisker to respond. I've already taken the globe out and placed the bonnet back on without it and the red and green flashing persists even then. Seems like I may have gotten a lemon.

Any help would be appreciated.


EDIT: after spending time on the phone with support (who were very patient and cordial), I ended up just asking for a refund. They think it might've been a calibration issue with my carpet, but I wasn't really willing at that point to keep trying. For $650, I was expecting a much better user experience."
Why is my LR4 not respecting 25-minute delay? It seems to stop considering anything past the third weight detection.

"Panel Lockout Seems to Revert to Off.Hi,

We've got a 19 month old and he loves to press the buttons on both the FR and LR. Seems like the Feeder Robot respects the Lockout but, somehow, every few days, the LR reverts back to not being locked out.

The one thing I can think of is that my wife and I have the LR app on our Androids but one or the other will set the panel lockout. It'll work for a random amount of time, and then we'll see him pressing the buttons and it responding.

Is there something I can check as to why this might be happening? 

Thanks."
"Message to CEOMr.  Zuppke,

Thank you for the recent message to your customers. It helps to know that you recognize you have a problem. I think most of your customers like the concept of your product and want to see you succeed. I personally have been a loyal customer for five years. I'm sure, however, that you can sense the level of frustration on this forum.

What would best address that frustration is more frequent, candid communication. The LR4 is undeniably flawed--or, at a minimum, unreliable--and seems to have been released prematurely. You must be working on fixes, but please let us know that. You are advertising heavily and presumably increasing sales while cutting back on customer support. That's not a good optic. It may help you get over short-term hurdles but risks damaging your reputation long-term. Moreover, continuing to send out faulty units will only compound your problem. 

You might be able to reduce returns and even support tickets if you would frequently reassure us that you're working on a solution to specific problems, such as the red bar of death, the frequent loss of WiFi connectivity, the overly sensitive sensors, or the globe getting stuck in an unusable position, to name a few. If some problems are insurmountable, it would be a show of respect to let customers know so that they can make informed decisions. Just communicate. 

Please. I have loved your products, the creative ingenuity of your ideas, and the excellent customer service you had in the past. Please make it all work again."
"Am I 'Reset King' for Phantom Delay Cycles?Now that I own both the LR3 and LR4 -- and am kitty steward to two highly active Bengals -- I'm finding myself trying to head off more and more unwanted phantom LR globe cycles by pressing the respective ""Reset"" button.  For the LR3, it doesn't help that it's near a window and use it to boost themselves up to look out, and for the LR4, just sticking their noses a few inches inside starts a phantom delay cycle.  Of course, in either instance, I'm hoping to save the motor from unnecessary running or premature failure (if it is possible).  


I might do this perhaps a half-dozen times a day.  But in this tongue-in-cheek posting, I was wondering if I should hand my ""Reset King"" crown to another.  What is the extent of your curious or undecisive-at-the-doorstep-kitty experiences?"

The 10lb one seems to 25% of the time not set off the sensor. Is there anything I can do to ""clean"" something to make it more sensitive? I can press turn in center and set off the weight detection but for some reason my cats don't set it off very often."
"Night Light always glooming a little bit, even when disabledHello,

"Secret hiding spot for everything gross‚Ä¶While doing some deeeeep deep cleaning of my 1.5 year old LR3 I discovered a secret hiding spot in the globe where everything gross exists.

It‚Äôs on the top of the globe near the opening for the litter to come out and underneath the grate that stores the litter when cleaning. If you pull back the grate plastic (which is extremely hard to do) you will find some foam around the inside of the litter opening and in my case I found gobs of caked on litter goo. üò≥ No wonder people complain about the smell even after cleaning!

Any suggestions on how to clean this? The plastic grate doesn‚Äôt seem to be removable so I have no idea how I would get to it. Maybe removing the liner?

I audibly gasped when I found this hiding spot and don‚Äôt know how to proceed. Any suggestions?!

"LR4 liner holes after less than 2 monthsI‚Äôve seen a few comments in LR FB groups and on here regarding the LR4 liner developing holes, and I unfortunately am seeing the same thing after less than 2 months. 

 Some background: we have 3 cats, none of which are big ‚Äú diggers‚Äù and don‚Äôt excessively scratch at the robots. We have had a LR3 as the only litter box for the 3 cats , for 2 years and the liner is unscathed! 

Yesterday As I was dumping the kicked-out litter back into the LR4 ( a sometimes daily occurrence ‚Ä¶ highly recommend using a dog crate tray to catch that if mats aren‚Äôt sufficient for you ), I noticed a hole in the liner right where the litter sits and another one on the side! I will admit that I thought maybe others who were experiencing the liners deterioration maybe had cats that messed with it / excessively dig/ bite the liner ‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt seem to always be the case, because my 3 don‚Äôt do those things. . .Kick litter out of it for fun and to torment me ? Yes, absolutely‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs the extent. 

 I reached out to whisker and sent photos and they initially said they‚Äôd send me a new liner, but then said they don‚Äôt have installation videos yet, so they‚Äôd be sending me a whole new unit and I‚Äôll send this one back ‚Ä¶ to be fair , I would be fine with written direction for installation, but this may just be easier for them right now , having units boxed and ready to go and not a surplus of pieces. 
 I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre resolving my issue , but I‚Äôm concerned now that I‚Äôll be doing this again in a couple months. Not only that, but now I feel like I need to inspect this robot more often to make sure it‚Äôs intact, and that shouldn‚Äôt be the experience for something advertised to make being a cat owner ‚Äú easier‚Äù. 
 I sincerely hope they are working on a solution for the liners in the 4, it‚Äôs clear that this is a fairly common issue already and it‚Äôs disappointing that this wasn‚Äôt corrected while they were being beta tested. I can‚Äôt imagine it being cost effective to ship replacement units out to folks constantly."
"Poop Diaries: Struggles of Rick James The Ragdoll vs LR3**TL/DR** \- bigger cat poops outside LR3, never did with LR2, I tried buying the steps bc i thought it was joint related, i tried multiple different brands of clumping clay. No dice. I think the angular division of space inside the box creates a different slope on roof and bottom of globe which makes it easier for paws to get stuck in wet clay. Cats don't want to step in their pee and poo. Have purchased Fence accessory, will try to see if it helps and update this thread. Would love it if Litter Robot and Whiskas could really show up for loyal customers and offer to exchange these for the LR4. It's the right thing to do for some of us.

**UPDATE 2:** we've been giving it a shot for a while, and he still ends up pooping outside of the box every once in a while. At this point, I would simply say, if you have a bigger cat in terms of 20 lbs and up, and I mean big as in SIZE not a big belly lol, I CANNOT recommend LR3 for the exact reasons I've mentioned in this exhaustive look at the physics of the device. Your cat might be big and might use it, but there is a high probability that it wont be comfortable for them, and when you think what percentage of a cat's life the bathroom visit takes up, it's just not right. Hopefully the LR4 will deal with this issue. I can already tell they've improved the aspects that I think are failures in the design change of the LR3. Unfortunately I will not be able to grab one as the pricing becomes more prohibitive with every new release of this robot. But you don't have to be me. 

**UPDATE:** so I installed the fence, and so far for the past 2 days we have not had any fehicular mishaps outside of the LR3. I will continue to observe and will be back in about a months time to give another update. I'm only doing this to help ppl out. I just want to mention again that the design of the globe is the actual problem here.

I went from the litter robot 2 (and both of my cats using it fine for 11 years replaced some parts on it though) to the litter robot 3 last year. I have a black short hair, and a large Rag doll, the Ragdoll stopped pooping in the LR3 and poops right in front of it. So let me run you down what I did and my process real quick:

\- First, I thought maybe it was a joint issue. He's getting older and this litter is at a bit of a weird angle and the step is designed very differently, so I bought the steps. Seemed to kind of do the trick for a little while, but not really. Strike 1

\- Then, I started noticing that he'd have litter stuck on his back paws (he uses the litter box backwards and poops and pees near the entrance. The stuck litter issue, never ever occurred on the LR2. I thought, okay it's the litter I'm using maybe? Switched litter 3 or 4 different types of EXPENSIVE Boxit, and cheaper clumping clay. No difference really except he doesn't get it stuck in his paws as much anymore (I'm guessing this is due to him pooping outside the box though lol)

\- Finally, I'm where I am today, and I honestly have very little belief this will make a difference, but I've bought the ""fence"" accessory and will be applying it as soon as it comes in the mail.

My thought process through all of this is that he's a big boy. Like a 24 pound fuzzy big boy. There has to be something going on with the internal geometry of the Litter Robot 3 that wasn't going on in the Litter Robot 2. I can tell you that the way the top of the rotating ball is designed is different enough in combination with what feels like some sort of measured difference in the way the bottom of the ball is designed. Clumps stick more, and clumps track more across the top of the ball. That's just the truth of it. Hate it or love it. It was NOT a problem in the LR2. I think the angular difference in the roof and the bottom creates a situation where pee spreads out more (which would normally be a good thing) but makes it more difficult for bigger cats to maneuver in a way that keeps their paws out of the wet clay. Also if you were a previous owner of the LR2 you'll notice that the LR3 globe is mounted at an upward angle of like 35 degrees, more or less, where as the LR2 was parallel to the ground. ***It'd be nice if Whiskas could release some sort of contraption to adjust the angle of the globes if we want to so that they are, much like their previous design, parallel to the ground.***

Personally, as a really really long time lover and customer of this product, I'd be ecstatic to be on their team and try out the LR4. I'd be happy to do an exchange for it with them. I'd be over the moon to be honest because I think they know what mistakes they made and it looks like they've purposely improved on them. But I sincerely doubt they'd do anything like that for me or my kitts. They're just so expensive to buy, it's prohibitive to upgrade for me after I spent money on one just last year. Especially in Canadian rupee. It saddens me because my dudes are senior citizens now, and I want them to keep living their best lives. I can't get mad at my buddy when he poops outside the box, he's not doing it to piss me off he's really self-conscious about it and knows it's not good, but it's not his fault. *It's my fault, and to be honest, it's* ***Litter Robot*** *and now* ***Whiskas*** *fault* as well and that's exactly why they've made the mouth of their LR4 so much bigger, in order to give bigger cats the ability to navigate better in the ball/globe. **I will update this when I get to test out the fence**. My idea is that it will allow homie to feel where he's at because of the higher ridge, and allow him to be more precise about not stepping in the wet clay spot. It's a pipe dream, and these additions have defo cost me money. It is what it is. They're family. Ya'll know that.

PS: Just want to add that I NEVER do things like this. I NEVER write these kinds of epic (need 100 hours to read) reviews and I always blame myself for buying bunk products. I actually really do believe this could help a potential owner make a better decision about this product though, and I never see anything highlighted anywhere that mentions this in full detail for people to understand that it is not a one-off experience and will happen to your kitt if he/she is a similar build. This is a purpose built apparatus for cat defecation, and it costs around $800 with tax.

"Those of you who have a camera on your LR4: what kind?My LR4 has been in service about 6 weeks, and of my three cats, as far as I can tell: the 16-year-old took a month or so but now has taken to it fine, the 14-year-old has used it twice, and the 15-year-old is still eyeing it like it might eat her. (TBF, she eyes everything like it might eat her.) She's a mostly-rehabilitated semi-feral, very anxious, and I genuinely am not sure how much she currently weighs, since I can't pick her up long enough to weigh her and she's shorter but plumper than the others.

So, I thought if I put a camera on the LR, as I've seen others do, I could at least be certain who is and isn't using it, as opposed to just having a strong suspicion. But, I've read that some of the cameras can interfere with cycling because of IR. Those of you who have a camera working well to monitor use of your LR, could you let me know what brand and model? Did you have to do anything special with setup or placement or the like? Thank you!"
"Hands down the worst customer service I've ever seen2 weeks ago I started having issues with my litter robot 4. I bought it a few months ago and have been experiencing the globe getting stuck and showing a half green, half flashing red bar on it. I made a post and after trying nearly everything I continued having the issue. I made a support ticket as some people advised, however whiskers customer support is extremely disappointing for an almost $1000 product. Whisker not only never responded to my support ticket, but commented on my post telling me to DM them only for them to open the chat and never respond. I love the product but genuinely can't get over how much of a joke the customer support is."
"New litter robot owner with some questions/concernsI'm a new Litter Robot 4 owner with a few questions/concerns. To start, I know there's a reputation in the sub for negativity (which to me is fair for $800 litterboxes that come with defects and errors), but I want to mention that my partner and I love the benefits of these boxes enough that we're genuinely trying to work through the problems we've been experiencing in our first week to make these fixtures in our lives.

1. One of our units drops wifi. I've tried looking to see what people do for this issue, but have had mixed results. For the people that have had this issue and had it resolved, what did you do? Did Whisker help? My first conversation with Whisker was pretty annoying; the person kept explaining that it simply had to be my internet (everything else but the litter box, including the other Litter Robot, works perfectly on it) or that I ""should move the litter robot next to my router"". Bad answer for the expensive product that drops wifi constantly.

2. We just found today that the other Litter Robot we got had a piece of plastic underneath the bin hanging off. I'm very gentle with expensive electronics and we have had this for under a week (for reference we've emptied a 90% full bin once); I know I did not do anything to break an ostensibly sturdy piece of plastic off. I think it had a hairline fracture either from the factory or during shipment. Does anyone have experience with this happening? Would they ship a big piece of plastic for me to install or would they want the whole unit sent back?

Again, I want to make these work. As egregious as I think these issues in week 1 are, the cats love the boxes and we love the basic functionality. If I can get these resolved, I think they'd be A+ products. But based on the sounds of things, Whisker definitely has a quality control problem. Any help is appreciated!

"LR4 ‚Äì Cat is hanging his butt just outside and pooping on the fenceHe's a big boy, about 14lbs, and after two days of using it, he's started hanging his butt just over the fence and pooping on top of it. He did this with a tidy cat litter system too and the _only_ thing I could do was use cardboard to make a really tall border to force him to keep his butt inside the box, but that doesn't seem physically possible with the LR4. 

So it's just over right? he's clearly trying to say he hates it? Which really makes me think this cat is hopeless, he does this with virtually any litter system I get, it's like he genuinely _wants_ to poop right outside the box."

"Do not hesitate to contact customer support - they actually want to helpI've had my LR3 connect for 23 or 24 months now. I bought the extended warranty. 

I've had issues with it since the beginning. I was so terribly disappointed with the amount of money spent on this machine. It was extremely finicky. Every error code / app notification - I've had at some point. I called customer service maybe a year or so ago. They managed to walk me through the bonnet removed error (bend tabs, clean connections) and it helped for awhile but I was still clearing errors at least weekly. New errors happened every few weeks. I was either on here or youtube or google every few weeks trying to figure out the errors. 

However in the last month or so, the thing is basically useless to me. It was repeatedly getting stuck upside down daily with yellow flashing lights. I have to manually reset it daily. I sent an e-mail to customer service to complain about this machine a week or so ago after cleaning up cat mess for the umpteenth time because the machine got stuck. They asked for pictures, explanations, etc. I provided all of it.  My app also tracked my errors, so I could reference exactly what was repeatedly happening. I wonder if they checked my app history log or something.  

They also made specific recommendations about the types of litter to use. Globe lift problems. Unclean machines causing weight / balance issues. The detailed help and troubleshooting I received was thorough, but ultimately didn't fix my issues.

I thought since I'm outside of warranty, they would maybe send a new base or bonnet at my expense. Maybe new sensors so I could replace them. 

They're sending a whole new unit.    Ôºà‚óé0‚óéÔºâÍí≥·µíÍí≥·µé·µé·µé

"Pinch detect fault few weeks after replacing pinch connectorHi all - 

Wondering if anyone is getting constant ""pinch detect faults"" from LR 3 Connect? 

I replaced the connector a few weeks ago (with genuine parts from LR) after pinch detect fault-ing for weeks, and once I replaced it, it worked fine... until yesterday after emptying the bottom tray, I started getting this message again. I have tried: re-aligning the bag, opening the unit up and cleaning for any debris, opening the bottom to re-position the connectors... all to no solution.

Now I'm wondering if I need to replace the motherboard for the pinch connectors entirely, or if it's just  an issue with the pinch connectors.

I've had the LR 3 Connect for about 2.5 years now, and constantly live in fear that the pinch connector will malfunction (lol). Anyone have tips/tricks on how to avoid the pinch detect fault scaries?

LR is a life changer, but I also am getting a bit tired of the pinch detect faults, and wondering if there are any other alternatives out there :("
"Litter Robot 4 + Eufy CameraTitle explains it all.

Hooked up a Eufy Indoor camera to the USB port of the LR4 and it looks and works great. 

It's easily detachable and works with infrared at night, allows audio passthrough and it record locally to the SD card.

Some Eufy cameras have had a bit of a bad press recently, so I repurposed this one for the litter Robot seeing this isn't security sensitive stuff, and it works great!

Attached photos of it in action, I just wish the Eufy camera was black, or I had opted for the White litter box. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"Help with securing the fence on the LR4My boy cat loves to sit in the LR, and scratch at the fence for extended periods of time, from the outside in.  Twice now, he's managed to dislodge the fence so that it goes into the LR, to be deposited in the bin, both fouling the fence, as well as making the LR believe that the bin is full.  Any tips on making sure the fence is better secured so that it's harder for him to dislodge?    


Leaving it off is not an option, as both he and his sister are really good at making sure there's an equal amount of litter outside the bot as in, when there's no fence in place."
"Struggling to acclimateI‚Äôve had the LR4 for ~2 weeks now. The cats have used it once to urinate in the very beginning and have not touched it sense. I‚Äôve kept the old litter boxes (though not cleaned them) out of fear that if I remove them that they‚Äôll start toileting on the floor. 

Here‚Äôs a rough timeline: 
- day 1: set up LR4 in new area of the apt with fresh litter. 
- day 2-6: waste tray had one clump of urine 
- day 7: added litter from the old boxes (without excrement) to the LR4 
- day 8-14: will get notifications that the sensor is going off, though on video (we have a security cam) they put half their body in, sniff around, step out, and then sit and watch till it completes a cycle. 
- day 17 (today): added much more old litter and moved the LR4 to where the original boxes were. Moved the original boxes to where the LR4 was. Sprinkled some catnip around the general LR4 area. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm really wanting this to work. I‚Äôm thinking my next shot would be changing the timer from every 7min to every 15min to reduce the cycles and hopefully they associate the LR4 less as a toy and more like a litter box. 

Any other suggestions or tips?"
"Flashing Red and Green Light and Unable to Connect Device to AppI've had the Litter Robot 4 for less than a week. It was working perfectly until 2 days ago when I changed the waste tray. I'm not sure what happened exactly, but the unit is flashing green then red lights. I've researched what I can find on Reddit and the web, but non of the troubleshooting has resolved the issue. Thankfully, the unit still cycles after it's been used.

Details:

The unit has been on hardwood floor since I've had it. I've made sure the feet were clean and moved it to another part of my house. Green and Red lights are still there. 

Per the support center, I tried adding weight to the bottom tray and then reset it, but that also didn't clear the lights.

There are 2 connectors near tray, one for power, and the other for the weight sensors(I think) They're both firmly secured. 

&#x200B;

I also haven't been able to connect the device to the app. I follow the prompts and it says it's successful, but the device doesn't appear in the app. I made sure to connect the device to a 2.4 wifi signal.

Does anyone have any other troubleshooting tips? I'm probably going to just exchange the device, but I'm not excited to have another unit from this company."
"Continuous Issues with the LR4Hey all, hoping for some guidance. I had a LR3 for years, and while I did have sporadic issues, they were relatively easy for me to fix myself.

I‚Äôm very much in an ongoing struggle with my LR4 that I received in August. 

Frequently it gets stuck mid cycle, sometimes random glitches other times I realized early on that the fill line measurement for litter is deceiving.

Facts: it‚Äôs on a hard even surface, and I‚Äôm using regular clay litter. It‚Äôs not touching any walls, and the litter is now always a bit below the fill line to accommodate the design flaw.

The problem: over torque issue that I now can‚Äôt get it to work at all:

I‚Äôve tried the following:
-inspected the globe and base unit including seals, filter, and motor for any debris or obstructions. 

-cleaned every part of the base unit and globe 

-checked the ‚Äúwheels‚Äù, globe track, and unit base motor gear, and they‚Äôre all stable/not loose

-separated the liner from the globe and confirmed the counterweight is securely in place 

-made sure all bonnet connection points are aligned every time when trying to get it to cycle

-cleaned all sensors

-updated the firmware 

-obviously powered off/on and unplugged/replugged as well multiple time.

Literally nothing is helping.

I reached out to Whisker support and find they respond in like 3+ days per message/reply with one suggestion, which is irksome because I‚Äôm now using this as a glorified regular litter box for 3 cats that I spent $700 on until it can be fixed. 

Anyone have similar issues that tried something I haven‚Äôt outlined here that helped? 

Any advise is greatly appreciated!"
"I GIVE UP‚Ä¶I have been a multi cat customer since 2015.  Last unit I received in 2019 I believe. 

But as others have said, when working well , they are worth the cost and the 1/2 a room they take up in space.  I found them helpful for me with back issues, easier to change out bag than bend over for 5 minutes to dredge and scoop ‚Äú the old fashioned way‚Äù 

I‚Äôve also owned every other kind of box ever invented before these..

Owned a total of 4 litter robots open air 3‚Äôs with all the accessories and have maintained them meticulously, I still change the bag every day full or not. Use Elseys litter and deep clean every month or so. 

I agree they have all had their quirks and I‚Äôve had to replace, practically everything, and troubleshoot etc over the years. Spent thousands. 

Of course they are all out of Warrenty now. 

Recently one of the bases crapped out and I really needed support. 

, I tried calling and did not know the company changed hands. 

I emailed the ‚Äúsupport ‚Äú team. 
It‚Äôs been over a month. 

I threw out the fucking thing and replaced with the old fashioned scoop litter box. 

Now another is acting up. 

I just discovered this sub and see I have no shot in hell to get support. 

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LITTER ROBOT. 

Here is my assessment:
Biggest concern‚Ä¶ besides the CONSTANT trouble shooting, large Pees stuck to bottom, lights blinking , unit stuck half way around and blinking,to name a few.. 

This technology has actually ‚Äútraumatized ‚Äú my cats as they have gotten older. 

They are fine for young cats but when they become seniors and have mobility or health issues ( that they are trying to hide from other cats) I find the cats are hesitant to use box, circling around, making sure no other cats are watching until their waste spins out. 

1) If your cat has dilute urine from kidney, thyroid or other issues issues, the pee is large and usually sticks to the bottom no matter how much litter and how long you set the timer before spinning. 

This results in having to scrape and clean the rubber lining frequently.
10-15 minutes and replacing litter. 

2)  if your cat is large 15-20 lbs, they really don‚Äôt fit in there comfortably and again, my elderly cat started using the ‚Äúlip‚Äù to rest his butt on so pee or poo was left on the stairs, and the fence accessory only encourages this. 

3) the fence accessory is useless if you have a ‚Äúdigger‚Äù. Litter is still all over the outside of box.  Also litter somehow winds up outside the back of the box for no reason also and clogs the power supply inlet which fails at some point. 

4) If you don‚Äôt change the bag every day, your house stinks. Maybe this is improved with newer model, but when I saw the price went up $300, I say NO!

Since I went back to the old $30 scoop box, my cats use this box more than the robots that are left, and I suspect it won‚Äôt be long before the last 2 shit the bed. 

When they are ‚Äúdone‚Äù ‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôm going back to the $30 box. 

My cats are acting normal, not lingering around the box waiting for it to spin ‚Äú guarding ‚Äú against other cats, no more litter tracked all over than the LR, and I have a sense of ease not reacting to blinking light, or stuck and unusable entryway
Not coming home to a nasty surprise üí©, or having to unexpectedly trouble shoot when we are exhausted. 
( we fight less about this too)

Frankly my husband and I are too old for this shit, and so are our cats. 
I can‚Äôt imagine having a Wi-Fi and notification feature so that you can know that there are all these problems While you are not at home and cannot do anything about it.



This seems like a really stupid idea.



So, just my two cents, and frankly if I had had prompt customer service to resolve some of these recent issues I may not feel as strongly,

But all around this is a bad product and terrible way to treat loyal customers."
"Frequent Interruptions During CycleHello,

I've been reading posts here for a while, trying every solution people offer, and I'm at my wit's end. First of all, thank you to everyone in this community for helping each other out, it's great to see!

I got a LR4 about a month ago. I like it, but it keeps stopping partway through a cycle with the red light on. I'll stand and watch it to make sure my kitties aren't sticking their heads in, and it'll stop 2 or 3 or more times. I'll press the reset button and it'll continue the cycle, then stop again, and I'll have to press it again. If I leave it alone, it USUALLY eventually continues and completes the cycle, but the interruptions are annoying and shouldn't be happening.

I gave it a good cleaning yesterday and changed the litter (from Tidy Cats to Arm & Hammer Slide), and it went through a few cycles without interruptions, but eventually it started happening again.

\- It's on a flat surface

\- It's not against a wall

\- When I was vacuuming the inside, I went over the sensors lightly

\- I ran a microfiber cloth over the sensors

\- The weight in the liner feels secure, not loose

\- The firmware is updated to the latest version

\- I reset the weight sensor when I changed the litter, and I've also done it in between cycles

&#x200B;

A friend suggested I take a little bit of litter out, so I did (and reset the weight sensor) and it went through a whole cycle without error, but now it's back to stopping a few times.

Is it the sensors on the top of the bonnet? The weight sensor? Neither? I would greatly appreciate any help."
"Cat sensor fault just after we‚Äôve left for a 3-week vacation!We‚Äôve never had this problem before over the last 6 months. Cleaned out the drawer and hit ‚Äòreset‚Äô like usual this morning. 

I got the sensor fault notification right after we got through airport security. LR4 is still paused and won‚Äôt cycle an hour later. What luck!!

House + cat sitter will be there today but is not familiar with LR, and we aren‚Äôt familiar with this error. 

What should we ask them to do to troubleshoot? Should we hedge our bets and have an old fashioned litter box shipped to the house? This is so frustrating."
"Did I get scammed? My LR4 came loosely in a brown box with zero foam or protection, and there is no power chord or instruction Manual to be found. What the heck‚Ä¶"
"Constant cat sensor faults on LR4I want to love this thing so bad. For such an expensive item that came highly recommended, I'm more than just a little disappointed. 

I initially had these cat sensor faults the moment I took it out of the box and set it up. My assumption was that I had used too much litter, so I removed some and that solved the problem for several days. I was happy. Cats were happy. It was great! Everything was working normally until it started with these cat sensor faults again a few days later. Only now it's happening every single time it cycles. No matter what I do, it will not complete a full cycle, under any circumstances, without getting stopped. Some more information: 

\- I've been through all the self-troubleshooting steps. Numerous times.   
\- I've wiped off the top of the globe where the lasers are, also several times.   
\- I've reset the scale constantly (by pressing the ""X"" button and watching the lights flash white)   
\- The LR4 is on a flat tile floor. No carpet or anything. Machine is totally level.   
\- If I power cycle the machine, it will complete a cycle one single time. Any cycles after that trips the cat sensor.   
\- I've unplugged the machine for a while.   
\- I saw someone recommend tilting the machine while powering it on. That didn't work either.   
\- I've removed it from the app and re-added it (I'm not sure why I thought that might work, but saw it recommended elsewhere and tried it)   


I contacted Whisker support more than a week ago and have heard absolutely nothing. I'm trying my best to be patient because I understand how busy they are currently. But after spending $700 on a machine that doesn't work and receiving zero support, I'm more than just a little frustrated. I've seen numerous complaints about this exact issue, so I was really hoping this was something simple that could be easily fixed, maybe with a firmware update. I'm really hoping I can avoid having to figure out how to box the thing up and send it back or get it replaced or having to wait 6-8+ weeks on a replacement, but I fear that's what's going to happen. I'm not really sure what else to do at this point. I'm open to any and all suggestions for anything I haven't tried yet. I'm so close to just giving up on it and going back to a regular litter box.

"Red light of death after two weeks useRed light of death after only a couple of weeks of use. At first, I could just reset it and it would work. Then, I'd have to power on/off and it would work. Then, I'd power it on and off and it would only move a bit and then stop. Now, it just stays red and won't move.

I tried the following to no avail:
1. Put in/took out litter
2. Emptied waste drawer and cleaned globe
3. Cleaned sensors (vacuumed and gently wiped)
4. Removed and then replaced globe
5. Checked gears
6. Cleaned all debris in and around unit thoroughly 
7. Changed litters
8. Tried to run empty
9. Checked that all areas were secure and nothing impeding movement
10. Cleaned off all legs
11. Placed on hard level surface ensuring nothing was touching it on any sides

I think I've exhausted all the troubleshooting. Sent in a ticket. Anxiously awaiting a response.

Was loving this thing, but right now it is an unreliable and unusable piece of crap. I'm scooping poop again. Only improvement is I have a collection box built in to the thing to dump the poop.

Very disgruntled customer atm."
"Litter Robot BonnetWhen my litter robot rotates or it is in timer cycle phase, I get the notification ‚ÄúBonnet is removed‚Äù and the yellow light is flashing on the liter box. I check and the bonnet is secure. So I always have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the bonnet to get it to start rotating again. I even stand there watching to see if I notice anything coming loose - nothing does, but it stops rotating, the yellow light flashes, and I get the notification. So I am wondering should I get a new bonnet? Is the sensor or something going bad? Has any one else had this problem."
"What a Sham**Update\***   
I want to take a moment to address Whisker support. Once I found the online portal, the support rep was very quick to respond and diagnose my issue. My unit is being replaced. Fingers crossed the new unit is as amazing as most people say. I hope Whisker's leadership is paying a competitive salary to factory and customer support workers of the litter robot. This is a really niche product with a very high price compared to what I can only assume is a low cost to manufacture based off of the quality of components. At any rate, my overall support experience was fantastic with very quick reply's. Will update on the turn around time for a new unit. 

  
**Original Post**   
Ok I know bad reviews are normally reported the most but I would like to start out by saying the LR4 was great! For appx 2 weeks. Now the bad:

Day 1

Assembled unit, worked great. When robot cycled, it seemed like the top of the unit was not secured in place. The lid would shift and create a small gap that has since seemed to widen during the cycles. Attempted calling the support number and got a message saying they are not taking support calls due to the large influx of calls. Great. I dealt with it since it seemed to be functioning fine.

Week 1

Noticed the cat weight sensor was way off. Our 5lb Cat was showing as 1.2lbs. Again not a big deal but would expect it to work with the price tag.

At least cleaning the unit is super easy.

Week 2

Noticed my cat using the bathroom in our plant pots. Checked the litter robot and it was stuck upside down with the waste bucket exposed. Cats obviously dont want to climb in. I checked my app and it was in this mode for about 45 minutes before I noticed it. Manually recycled the robot, all seemed well.

Week 2.5

Again cat using bathroom in plant pot... Im super upset at this point as I then needed to clean the mess, change the soil, check the robot, and cycle again.

Week 3

Litter Robot stuck upside down again. I followed the support site recommendations. Nothing blocking the sensors but I wiped them anyways with a dry paper towel. I then did the manual reset holding the connect and empty buttons on the robot. Waited a full 2 minutes and powered it back on. It worked for 2 Cycles. Then stuck upside down again.

I have now fully lost confidence in the litter robot. Support site is useless. There is no one to talk to. I paid far too much for a robot that I need to leave powered off when I leave the home so my cats have a bathroom.

&#x200B;

Edit\* I should say my biggest complaint is the troubleshooting and lack of support. There is no way in hell I should have to spend more than an hour troubleshooting a litter box. Let alone trying to find the serial number, order number, support site, etc to get a ticket submitted. For the price we pay for the product, there should be the ability to just submit a ticket (if that is the route they want to go) directly from the app. At the very least, there should be an easy way to chat with a support rep if they are no longer doing phone support."
"Should I hold off on purchasing a Litter Robot 4?I always wanted a litter robot as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone when I say cleaning up cat poop is the worst part of owning a cat. With the release of the LR4, I was very interested in purchasing one but this is what gathered in less than 30 minutes of searching Reddit for an answer:

The liner is thin and tears easily. 
The charcoal filter needs to sit correctly or it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit not on a perfectly flat 180 degree surface, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the litter is too heavy or too light, it won‚Äôt work. 
If there is too much litter or too little litter, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit is facing a window, it won‚Äôt work. 
If you have indoor security cameras with night vision, it won‚Äôt work. 
The chances of getting a machine that actually works in the first place isn‚Äôt too high and a lot of you are on your second LR4 unit already. 

The list goes on, and I‚Äôm truly wondering: is this nearly $700 machine truly worth it? If I‚Äôm paying that much for anything, I expect it to work without much troubleshooting and be reliable for a reasonable amount of time. Or should I hold off to see if any of these issues are addressed?"
"My Advice: WaitSo I've been following the LR4 for awhile now and while the initial response to it seemed great, more and more people are encountering delivery issues and product quality control issues. Bottom line is this company is not ready to service it's intended consumer-base. If you've already ordered, settle in for a ride on how not to treat your consumer base (I seriously hope they learn from this and get better because we want products like this to succeed in the market - its a cool product and is helpful for pet owners). If you haven't ordered yet, my advice is to wait until you have a stable delivery process, and stable product without bugs/quality issues, and a better customer service experience.

Production Issues: 25% of American homes have a cat. That's over 31million households. If only 1% of those households ordered a Litter-robot, that would be over 300,000 LR4s that would need to be produced. There is no way they got 1% of cat-households to order, but they should've looked into the numbers and been prepared for a high-demand response and supplicated orders to reflect that. Create a sign up list/waiting list. Keep in mind that they charged everyone at the time of order, Whisker essentially held $800+ from me for a product I didn't even see for 3 months.

Delivery Issues: I have never seen a company charge so much for a product only to not care if it ends up at its destination. Not only does it **not** require a signature, but they went with the cheapest shipping option of no updated delivery windows. I've had expensive packages ranging from $500-$2000 and all of those required signatures/secure delivery and had updated delivery windows on the day of to make sure I was there for the package. For your delivery you will receive a ""before end of day"" tracking window, which means you better be prepared to camp your door for your super expensive obvious machine that comes in a box that says ""Robot"" on the outside.*Skip this part if you don't want to read about my experience:* Ordered LR4 BLACK. Delivery by  mid July promised. Scheduled Vacation for end of August. Got informed of delayed shipment for Aug 25-Aug 31st. No Big Deal - re-scheduled Vacation for mid August. Packing for Trip on August 12th that leaves on Monday Aug 15th. Receive Email from Whisker that my package has shipped and will arrive Monday Aug 15th??? No email from Whisker to ask if a new delivery date was ok, no email to let me know that they somehow produced more units ahead of schedule. Delayed trip 3x days ( lose $400+ in hotel fees/lost rentals). Package does not arrive Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday(18th now if you're keeping track) - contact Fedex who says package is lost - contact Whisker who says somehow the package was shipped to California. Email chain with Whisker begins - package is shipped back to Whisker who promises to ship it out for Aug 25th. Today is Sept 23rd. I had to email on Sept 20th when I had not received any update on the status of my order and low-behold - order immediately shipped out and I got it today. But guess what... they got the address wrong again - and luckily Fedex fixed it this time and I got my package on time. Opened my package but oops - free gift wasn't included in this one; guess I should've vacationed to Cali to pick up my original package dang it.

Product/Quality Control Issues: See reddit threads. Various issues regarding the quality of the liner for the LR4, various issues with wiring, various issues with integrated software/hardware, and some people have complained of jamming. The app is outdated and seems to be throwing errors/incorrect information at every opportunity. I've also seen threads of people not receiving the promised free gift for the Black LR4 delay - that for some reason was kept super super secret?? (edit: to save people from searching: it was some cat toys and a 2pack OdorTrap). The Customer service phone number was turned off because of all the complaints/tickets that they've been receiving but you can still continue to order product from them online that they will immediately charge you for even though your product won't ship for another 2-3 months.

"First blinking blue ready, and then violently yellow blinking cycleSiiiigh. 

Litter Robot 3. 

I‚Äôve taken then thing apart multiple times, cleaned the sensors, made sure those two metal pieces are touching. I‚Äôve made sure the waste receptacle bag is pushed down and not blocking the sensors. I‚Äôve unplugged at the base. I‚Äôve unplugged at the wall. I‚Äôve ‚Äúreset‚Äù the unit.

"LR4 - smol bugHello all! I have the LR4 and so far I have absolutely loved it. I went from running into constant issues on my LR3 with how it dumped poo in one spot and ""filled"" too quickly to it working almost seemlessly with the LR4. Having to interact with the robot went from every 2 days to once a week (2 cats). 

The only small issue I have found is that, every time I have to add litter, I get the red blinking light error. I don't overfill and I have noticed that if I unplug and replug the bot, it cycles and goes back to working flawlessly. This isn't a huge deal but since I have a large bookcase blocking the outlet, I would rather not have to do that. I would just use my smart plug but it is one from my security company and has the plugs on the side which won't allow me to plug it in. 

Any tips for me?"
"LR4 Review - Big Kitty & back sprayerMy furbaby name is Archer, he is a 13lbs Siberian mix, 8 yes old and neutered. I rescued him at like 3 weeks old and raised. He has always backed up his tush to pee and despite all attempts he always chose to pee this way, he is also on the large/longer side and most cat boxes were not big enough, which resulted in us creating this custom tile cat bathroom in an unused corner, long story shorter, we lined the back wall of this custom cat bathroom with puppy pads attached to clips so he wouldn't be peeing on the tile wall (it was much easier to change the puppy pads that scrub tile)..that became just as time consuming as having to deal with plastic liter box leaks..it got worse for my poor cat with my depression and I sadly neglected to clean his bathroom as often, yeah the smell inside my master bathroom was strong...anyway I decided to bite the bullet and order the liter robot 4 because it looked roomier enough for my Archer. Yeah the price concerned me especially if he ended up hating it/not using; I felt like I owed it to Archer to give this a try for both of us. I was quoted a 6-9 week arrival time and it arrived in like 2 weeks. I set up the day it arrived but since it did not fit near his existing bathroom we put in a place where his liter box used. Archer was very interested in the movement and sound was not scary at all, he observed it for one week and the following weekend I decided to remove his bathroom and  do lots of pep talks with Archer. I scooped a poo and placed inside the LR4 explaining Arch that's the new loo and it would be way better than mommy and her hard days. He immediately went in there and did his business. He doesn't completely squat down to pee but doesn't quite back spray high up. We use pretty liter with it since it helps monitor urine pH levels to make sure he's not stressed or getting to a blocked stage. With the new bot loo arrangement he has been peeing a lot more, healthy and you can tell he's happy about how clean it stays. I'm so glad the opening for the LR4 is much bigger than the previous version, that was a huge point for me since Archer is big and I care about his comfort. The bonnet does seem a bit flimsy and not totally secured in place, kinda feels cheappy. Other than that we absolutely love it and highly recommend."
"PSA LR4 owners: Ghost cats triggering the unit to cycle: A MUST READI have owned my LR4 about 6 weeks so far.  Thankfully I read this sub for a bit before my unit arrived so I saw was the unit should be on some type of flat surface.

For the most part it is has been ok experience for me (please note I never updated the firmware on it a couple weeks back and to do this day I haven‚Äôt either).

But in the beginning I had the ghost cat cycling sporadically (2-3x a day) and looking at my camera (which doesn‚Äôt point directly at the LR4) I wouldn‚Äôt see either of our 2 cats even in the area.  Even looking at the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô in the app, there would no cat weights recorded.  A lot of people have been putting indoor security cameras pointing at their LR4‚Äôs to see when the kitties use the LR.  But the IR sensors from the security cameras that look at the LR4 mess with the 3 cat sensor beams that come from the top of the hood and trigger the unit to cycle with no cats present üò¢.

Small background, my LR4 is in our finished basement but in a utility room on the original cement floor.  At first I was having ghost cycling problems and the unit stopping mid cycle and getting stuck as well.  Upon further troubleshooting I realized I had the LR4 directly on the cement floor, yes, but the floor was sloped a good deal because it was near the French drain sump pump pit .  So then I moved it a bit and put a very thick plastic kitchen cutting board (from Amazon / so I could more easily clean+sanitize it VS plywood) underneath it and the cutting board was fairly long so it spanned the top of my underground sump pump pit + cover.  It worked pretty well there for 4 weeks or so until we had 5 straight days of rain and then sump pump started running with frequency. Then the LR4 started the ghost cycling again.  It took 1-2 days for me realize but even though it was on a thick plastic cutting board spanning a solid cement floor,  just the slight vibrations from the sump pump running was causing the ghost cycling.  On Tuesday I moved it to another part of the utility room and put the cutting board underneath it directly onto the cement floor and have not had one ghost cycle since.

So in short, my PSA after using the LR4 for about 6 weeks is it is SUPER SENSITIVE, so possibly even if your LR4 is on a 1st, 2nd, 3rd floor etc, if the floor just moves slightly sometimes to people in the house, things being moved around, etc I will cause the LR4 to sense something which then triggers the unit to cycle.  In the 2 days I had the LR4 on plywood spanning the underground sump pump, it probably ghost cycled 40-50 times.

In all of those 40-50 times never once in the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô did it ever log anything I saw so from the ghost cycling perspective it doesn‚Äôt help with troubleshooting.

Additionally, they may need to put out a firmware update so it isn‚Äôt so sensitive?!?  Don‚Äôt really know what the fix will be but not everyone has a solid cement level floor to put it on.

So in short, it the LR4 isn‚Äôt perfectly level and near any type of vibration it‚Äôll contribute to the ghost cycling.

Just wanted to share this information to help everyone in this sub!

"LR4 ""expert mode"" troubleshooting, please?The programmer / robot hacker in me has been thinking about the problems I (and others) have been having with the LR4, and I hope Whisker can give us a firrmware or API to do more debugging. Based on my experience and other posts here, it seems a bunch of robots went out the door without precise calibration or sensors and with unpredictable software. These things can be fixed in software if we have visibility/access to do so. Here are some robot troubleshooter's notes:

The promo video shows cat detection using an upper ""laser"" (though my investigation of it shows wider beam IR LED behavior, not tight-beam IR laser) and weight sensors and what it calls a ""cat presence sensor"" in the bottom front of the box. but doesn't tell us which sensor triggered the Cat Sensor Fault. 

The promo video shows weight detection, but does not allow the user to see the ""raw weight"" of sensors as they are detected or an kind of data export. Notably, we cannot get a live view of how full the litter level is, or how much ""cat"" is being detected. 

We are unable to adjust the sensitivity of any of the sensors. If the front sensor is acting up but the weight and laser sensors are fine, we cannot see that.

Without access to raw sensor data, we cannot see if we can change anything to make it feel better. If the top laser sees IR or UV light in the box from security cameras and that causes a fault, we don't know. If the cat's digging creates a big mound in the middle of the box, we don't know that it's tripping the sensor. 

Last time my cat box notified me it was ""full"" it was actually a bit OVER full and I had  to fish out a couple clumps that fell into the tray drawer area as I removed the tray. It would be nice to be able to calibrate when we reset it as ""empty."" and get a raw data amount when we get notified it's ""full"" (then set it to notify us about 3-4 cleaning cycles sooner.) 

**PROPOSED SOLUTION**
An ""expert mode"" in the app or an API to the LR4 that allows us to poll the robot and get live results. That's' all. Users will opt-in, crowdsource the troubleshooting data, and post our experiences with it, then report back. Boxes won't go back unless they are mechanically broken. Users can solve their own problems by knowing where the fauls are. Whisker's tech support has more data on common problems. Whisker's engineers and assembly staff have more data on which components need more attention. Everyone benefits."
"Over-EngineeredI've had the Litter Robot 4 for \~6 months and am constantly having to tinker with it to get it running again. I've had issues with the pinch sensors, the infrared sensors, and now the weight sensors (I think anyways). Each time I've been able to get it running again by cleaning it, reseating the globe, wiggling the pinch sensors, etc.. This time I am having more trouble since we had a power outage the weight sensor is overly sensitive despite my attempts at using the reset to tare the scale.

All of that is annoying but what really makes me hate this product is why are there so many sensors? It's fairly obvious that either these are poorly made or that these sensors are very fragile. So why have so many of them? Why do I need an infrared sensor AND weight sensor to detect the cat? Why do I need a sensor preventing it from running when the bonnet is open? How am I supposed to investigate and diagnose problems when I can't even run the thing without it being closed up?

I would in a heartbeat take this product with the infrared, bonnet, and pinch sensors removed or even just disabled. It has fewer fault points and annoyances for when something inevitably breaks. Oh and the connect+reset hard reset doesn't do anything so I don't know if that's a firmware/model thing or if this thing is just bricked."
"Constant SMELL! Tell me what I‚Äôm missing here.I‚Äôve had a Leo‚Äôs Loo Too for a few weeks now and cannot for the life of me figure out the STANK situation. I know this is a LR community, but I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall might have a solution or pointers. Here‚Äôs the scoop:

We‚Äôre first time cat owners. I never in a million years would‚Äôve guessed we‚Äôd be a cat family (single mom w/2 teens). Or that we‚Äôd be so head over heels in love with our sweet boy! We adopted him, a 7 month old Russian Blue mix, 6 weeks ago.

The first 3 weeks we used a traditional hooded litter box with √ñkocat Original and it worked great. He had no issues and acclimated right away. There was zero (and I mean ZERO) smell other than when he dropped a log, which we would scoop fairly quickly. 

What led me to an auto litter machine was the idea that it‚Äôd be self scooping during the day when we‚Äôre all gone, and his solid waste wouldn‚Äôt be sitting there for hours while we are away. After spending hours and hours researching all different types of litter machines I decided to get the LLT.

As per the guidelines, you‚Äôre required to use clay clumping litter or it voids the warranty. I used Dr Elsey‚Äôs in this new setup and was happy to see our little guy hop right in and use it with no issues. I‚Äôve got to say the unit itself, the mechanism, the dumping, the app, the settings‚Ä¶all great!! 

BUT‚Ä¶by the end of day 2, the smell was getting real funky. He‚Äôs not an overly heavy urinator and his solids aren‚Äôt crazy putrid or anything, so I was confused as to why it would be so dang stinky so quick. I emptied the drawer, which has 2 charcoal filters in it and I added baking soda to the drawer, the bag, and a sprinkling in the litter itself. The next morning things smelled much better. 

But 2 more days of regularly sprinkling baking soda went by and we‚Äôre back to the stanky stank. The drawer wasn‚Äôt even full but it smelled like a diaper dumpster on a hot summer day. Now when I say it smells, I‚Äôm not talking the whole entire house. We have it in the bathroom where there‚Äôs a window and fan for airflow and ventilation. The smell is mostly isolated to the bathroom and then it starts to waft out in the hallway by day 2. I have to leave the window cracked and fan on 24/7 to keep the smell somewhat contained.

At that point I switched up his wet food because I‚Äôve read that that can greatly affect the smell of their waste. So it‚Äôs now a rotation of Sheba and Tiki Cat. I also bought Rocco & Roxie Litter Box Odor Eliminator to add along with the baking sofa, and I switched to BoxiePro litter since I‚Äôd seen so many great reviews about it on here. Alas, nothing changed. The new litter was great for a day and the additives would mask the smell for a few hours and then we were right back to Stankytown.

Last weekend, I completely disassembled the whole thing and thoroughly cleaned it top to bottom in every crevice of the drum, drawer, and underbelly with an enzyme cleaner from Nature‚Äôs Miracle. Keep in mind, that‚Äôs only after the first 2 weeks. I then bought 2 Fresh Wave Odor Eliminating jars and put them both underneath, one in the waste drawer and one next to the drawer pushed to the back of the unit. Well, same as before. Good for one day and we‚Äôre smelling absolutely rotten again, and the odor is seeping out further than the bathroom.

I just ordered an air purifier from Amazon as my one last attempt at figuring this out and I‚Äôve decided to empty the drawer every night as a way of mitigating the absolute stench from taking over everything.

But sheesh‚Ä¶for the amount of $ spent on this machine I‚Äôd think it‚Äôd do a much better job of keeping the smell contained. Perhaps someone out there has the magic answer!  If the air purifier doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm going back to the plain old litter box with √ñkocat."
"How to get cats to not cover their poo/pee in the roboI have three cats. They've acclimated to it fairly quickly, but I'm running into an issue where they are twirling around inside the robo trying to cover their poo/pee and end up stepping on older clumps/getting some poo on their fur that sometimes are on the sides of the inside of the dome.

One of my cats is pretty long, so when he poos it tends to end up on the walls of the robo.

Any advice??"
"Experiences with elderly cats & their active bladders? üêà‚Äç‚¨õRight now, I‚Äôve been using the Purina Breeze because it‚Äôs been fairly good even if it‚Äôs a bit pricier.

"Constant issues with LR4 Please helpUpdate- I contacted support through their website because the click here link in the app wasn't clickable... Anyways they replied pretty quick and are sending a replacement base.  

I got the Litter robot 4 about a month ago and at first loved it.  I was hesitant to buy it based on the price but kept reading story after story of how great it is and figured I'd give it a try.  we have 4 cats and the youngest 2 took to it fairly quickly and with the exception of them constantly sticking their heads in when it was cycling causing it pause repeatedly, it seemed to work flawlessly.  

about a week later, all 4 cats have adjusted to it but now we start to have the same issues over and over.  One problem is that it constantly reports full after ever cleaning cycle.  with a fresh liner in place(and they are the LR4 liners) we might get one cleaning cycle where it doesn't report being full but by the second cleaning cycle it's flashing full.  during the day it's not as big a deal to be hitting the cancel button after each cycle, but overnight is always a problem and when we get up in the morning and cycle it, when the litter falls(usually heavy clumps) the unit stops and the light goes solid red.  this has been the second issue that is making me regret this purchase.  you can't cancel the red light like you can when it detects a cat.  the unit becomes frozen and nothing fixes it.  I tried unplugging it for a minute and then plugging back in and it goes through it's initial light sequences and then stops with a half green half red light bar.  ultimately the only way I can get it working again is by removing the bonnet and manually returning the globe to the start position.  I've been doing that multiple times a day and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't paid $700.  

I have researched all the tips and solutions and nothing works more than a day most.  we have it on a hardwood floor, level, not on a rug, not touching any walls.  I have removed the globe and cleaned out any stray litter. I have cleaned the sensors with a dry rag.  I have made sure the liners are on tight and not sticking out where they can get caught.  I also installed the newest firmware this week without any improvement.  I want to love this thing but all I'm feeling is buyer's remorse."
"New litter robot owner with some questions/concernsI'm a new Litter Robot 4 owner with a few questions/concerns. To start, I know there's a reputation in the sub for negativity (which to me is fair for $800 litterboxes that come with defects and errors), but I want to mention that my partner and I love the benefits of these boxes enough that we're genuinely trying to work through the problems we've been experiencing in our first week to make these fixtures in our lives.

1. One of our units drops wifi. I've tried looking to see what people do for this issue, but have had mixed results. For the people that have had this issue and had it resolved, what did you do? Did Whisker help? My first conversation with Whisker was pretty annoying; the person kept explaining that it simply had to be my internet (everything else but the litter box, including the other Litter Robot, works perfectly on it) or that I ""should move the litter robot next to my router"". Bad answer for the expensive product that drops wifi constantly.

2. We just found today that the other Litter Robot we got had a piece of plastic underneath the bin hanging off. I'm very gentle with expensive electronics and we have had this for under a week (for reference we've emptied a 90% full bin once); I know I did not do anything to break an ostensibly sturdy piece of plastic off. I think it had a hairline fracture either from the factory or during shipment. Does anyone have experience with this happening? Would they ship a big piece of plastic for me to install or would they want the whole unit sent back?

Again, I want to make these work. As egregious as I think these issues in week 1 are, the cats love the boxes and we love the basic functionality. If I can get these resolved, I think they'd be A+ products. But based on the sounds of things, Whisker definitely has a quality control problem. Any help is appreciated!

"One of my kittens is far too interested in the cleaning cycle.Now, we‚Äôve only had the Litter-Robot 4 for just over a week. Both cats took to it fairly quick. The cat in question took to it instantly. They are both about 4.5months old. One is more adventurous than the other but as soon as a cycle starts no matter where they are in the house they run for the robot. 

My app history is full of cycle interruptions I‚Äôve watched it in person to see it too. I‚Äôve even picked up the kitten or moved her away just to see how much she needs to watch this. 

Each time she interrupts it she goes in, trills and pads around inside, paws at the bits here and there, jumps out, and jumps back in, rinse and repeat. Often she will jump out and wait for the cycle to resume, then jump back in. Once she got in while the waste bin portion was open to air. I don‚Äôt know if it concerns her that there is (I presume) so much odour. She seems to try covering it by pawing on the plastic walls but also steps down into the waste bucket üò≥üôÑ

As for things I‚Äôve tried:

- Leaving sleep mode on  24/7 - trigger manual cycles through the day. What‚Äôs the point? It changes nothing but frequency of the cycle but not the behaviour.

- Set maximum delay before a cycle starts. This has probably been the best thing, plus sleep mode through the night. The idea is that it becomes more about using the litter than the cycle. But not to the point it becomes a manual cycling affair. 

Not sure if the kitty is just curious, I assume so, or disturbed by the fact that her scent keeps getting removed. I once watched her (not ‚Äúwatch watch‚Äù), go pee, get out, wait and interrupt the cycle (short delay at that point), then poop at the point just before the litter vanishes behind the grate, then get out and keep interrupting the cycle‚Ä¶when it finally completed after about 20min she went back in, and as if by magic pooped again as soon as it was done. She seemed ‚Äúquite concerned‚Äù when sniffing around when it was clean, so who knows‚Ä¶maybe she wanted to scent it up. I don‚Äôt mean to humanize her motives but I‚Äôm trying for some sort of rationale. Maybe she was actually doing me a favour and being patient before pooping? I have no idea what goes through a cat brain. 

Finally, when trying to keep her out during a cycle using my foot or picking her up, it‚Äôs almost like trying to keep an adult cat from catnip. It borders on a bit crazy trying again and again to get back in. I won‚Äôt be doing that again, I was just trying to see how much this was curiosity or need vs something else. She was pretty worked up trying everything to sneak back in. I don‚Äôt want to do anything to dissuade her from using it and trying to stop her from interrupting it is obviously pointless, she couldn‚Äôt separate the two concepts I‚Äôm sure, so I‚Äôll let her do her thing.

So I give up. She is using it right, at least initially, I have the longest delay set in hopes they might be too occupied to bother with it. My concern is she will start to trigger cycles and do her business mid cycle or get her paws into the waste bin consistently, I don‚Äôt want it to be come part of her routine. 

Anyone have a cat who was like this but settled down? Her sister is sane, on this issue at least üòÇ

So should I stay with the king delay cycle? Or set it as short as possible so it keeps triggering a cycle in hopes she bores of it?"
"Extremely Disappointed with the Recent Lack of SupportI know this has been talked about before but it‚Äôs a bit out of hand at this point. I have an LR3 and wanted to order the LR4 before I saw all the issues it was having shortly after launch. In the mean time my second LR3 which was replaced about 6 months ago started to have issues with the cat sensor. I reached out to support several times and never heard back, before posting this i messaged u/litterrobot directly via Reddit and was told my issue would be escalated, haven‚Äôt heard a thing since. 

This is beyond frustrating, there is no support via email, no access to chat, and no way to call. I understand growing pains and I think all of us here come from a place of understanding and willingness to ride out the storm because we believe in the company. However there is a fine line between being understanding and also having a fair expectation for support on a very pricey product. At this point I don‚Äôt think is too much to ask for at least a response in 24/48hrs. It‚Äôs been a week since I reached out and my issue was escalated. 

I believe this is a product that we come to rely on very much. This issue came up a week before me going on a trip and I did everything I could to find a resolution before leaving. I am now having to figure out how manage my litter situation while I am away. My plans to purchase a new LR4 are out of the picture and my expectation and ideas that the company will do what‚Äôs right are gone."
"Crystal litter is the best for litter robot 4I tried boxiepro clay, micro crystal clumping and normal crystal litter. 2 cats.

- Boxiepro clumped great, even too well. My cats had clay stuck to their back paws every time and one always had a wet butt after peeing. This was way messier than any crystal litter both around the box and wherever the cats paws landed. Too much mopping. Smell was average.

- Exsquisitcat Micro clumping crystal was just ok. It was much cleaner outside of the litter box and it didn't stick to my cat's paws or give them wet butts, but whatever makes this crystal litter (weakly) clump made the litter stick to and harden to the litter robot. I mean you had to SCRAPE it off and sometimes soak it for it to come off. Waste of time. It also stunk compared to the other litters because of this, since the hardened stuff had the piss in it and wasn't being mixed with more crystal or falling into the box.

- Exsquisicat regular crystal litter has been great! The pee doesn't clump which is a GOOD thing because it doesn't stick to the LR. You're supposed to MIX crystal litter daily so the crystals soak up the pee (and smell) and the litter robot does exactly that when it spins. The poop goes down like normal. The smell is AMAZING. I can only smell something if I stand right next to the robot (I have a strong sense of smell) whereas the others I could smell around the corner to varying degrees. There was one time the crystals clumped a little by a corner and a quick knock let it fall down.

To be fair, I haven't tried any clay litters besides boxiepro but I don't intend on trying not that I've found crystal litter to work so well."
"Best litter for scatterHi everyone,
Does anyone have recommendations for a type of litter that helps to minimize scatter? I recently got my LR. I have the large LR mat which helps trap a lot, but I‚Äôm still getting litter scatter all around the house; having to vacuum multiple times a week. Im currently using tidy cats free and clean. Thanks.

Edit: forgot to mention that my cat has asthma so I need it to be fairly dust-free and preferably unscented."

"Any luck with Support?I‚Äôm on my 2nd LR (a LR3 replacing a LR2 that stopped working), and now this one is stuck on the Pinch Sensor issue and needs a new sensor.

I emailed Support over a week ago and haven‚Äôt received any response. Is there a better way to contact them directly? I‚Äôm fairly frustrated

UPDATE: After emailing and calling, a Support Representative asked me what my serial number and address was. They sent me another LR3 base without telling me. I'm very grateful, but I wish they'd told me it was coming!"
"Drawer Sensor constantly triggeringheya! i bought a new LR4 unit and it was delivered about 6 weeks ago. It‚Äôs been mostly functional since then. The dome light wasn‚Äôt working, but that felt fairly minor. however, today the dome light suddenly started working and the robot constantly detects movement in the drawer. there‚Äôs no movement. i‚Äôve sat and watched, with the drawer out, and there‚Äôs definitely no mice sneaking in there üòÖ

i‚Äôve tried an abundance of solutions here, from a deep clean of the unit, including removing the globe, to putting paper towers under the feet to hope it may stabilize it. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs having an electrical issue since the light started working at the same time that the sensor issue started occurring. 

has anyone else experienced this situation or have any other ideas i could try? thanks!"
"Selling a LR?Has anyone had luck selling a used LR3? I was thinking either on here or FB marketplace. We actually love it, but my three cats definitely prefer the other two ‚Äúdumb‚Äù boxes we have, and it seems like such a waste for such minimal use."
"Solution for the most common LR3 failureThis is for those that are out of warranty or want to quickly fix their LR3's infamous blue flashing light, (Drawer full message), yellow fast flashing light (pinch detect) or are experiencing a labored motor sound when in cycle that eventually results in a Over torque fault, (Alternating yellow to red lights). These conditions are a direct result of the DFI failing.

The issue with the LR3's DFI is the fact the emitter board's I/O expander chip pins are being subjected to excessive moisture causing corrosion on the bank of pins that are exposed by the DFI shield's opening located at it's center is breaching the inadequate clearcoat that's suppose to render the circuit boards moisture resistant. (I've also noticed some of the solder joints to be less than adequate as well contributing to the issue). As a result 1 or more of the chips pins are experiencing tarnishing and corrosion creating bad solder joints. (the solder used has a high silver content and little to no lead, when silver is exposed to moisture it tarnishes, it turns, you guessed it?!, BLACK!)I have 3 LR3's and they all have suffered the same issue. When they were in warranty I had the DFI kits sent out and I kept the old DFI's. When the third one went I noticed the tarnishing on the chip pins, so I took a look a look at the old replaced DFI's and sure enough the same tarnished corrosion on the same spot!

The good news is its salvageable without replacement!!! The fix is to remove the DFI from the base unit, carefully clean as much of the corrosion off the pins as possible and re-solder all 10 pins on that side of the chip. Verify the work, clean all the flux off, and use a clear coat to seal the chip pins up so the problem doesn't return!!!

I've done this to many DFI boards and they work perfectly! I've only had one I/O chip failure and the replacement part literally is $1.50!!, It's a no-brainer financially!!! To me re-soldering SMT (Surface Mount Technology) components is fairly easy and if you have the solder skills, Awesome!.  Unfortunately to most its rocket science. But!, if you know someone that can do it or have an electronics repair shop in your area its literally a 5 to 10 minute job!!! And it will in 99.999% of the time get you back up and running once again!."
"LR4 liner holes after less than 2 monthsI‚Äôve seen a few comments in LR FB groups and on here regarding the LR4 liner developing holes, and I unfortunately am seeing the same thing after less than 2 months. 

 Some background: we have 3 cats, none of which are big ‚Äú diggers‚Äù and don‚Äôt excessively scratch at the robots. We have had a LR3 as the only litter box for the 3 cats , for 2 years and the liner is unscathed! 

Yesterday As I was dumping the kicked-out litter back into the LR4 ( a sometimes daily occurrence ‚Ä¶ highly recommend using a dog crate tray to catch that if mats aren‚Äôt sufficient for you ), I noticed a hole in the liner right where the litter sits and another one on the side! I will admit that I thought maybe others who were experiencing the liners deterioration maybe had cats that messed with it / excessively dig/ bite the liner ‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt seem to always be the case, because my 3 don‚Äôt do those things. . .Kick litter out of it for fun and to torment me ? Yes, absolutely‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs the extent. 

 I reached out to whisker and sent photos and they initially said they‚Äôd send me a new liner, but then said they don‚Äôt have installation videos yet, so they‚Äôd be sending me a whole new unit and I‚Äôll send this one back ‚Ä¶ to be fair , I would be fine with written direction for installation, but this may just be easier for them right now , having units boxed and ready to go and not a surplus of pieces. 
 I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre resolving my issue , but I‚Äôm concerned now that I‚Äôll be doing this again in a couple months. Not only that, but now I feel like I need to inspect this robot more often to make sure it‚Äôs intact, and that shouldn‚Äôt be the experience for something advertised to make being a cat owner ‚Äú easier‚Äù. 
 I sincerely hope they are working on a solution for the liners in the 4, it‚Äôs clear that this is a fairly common issue already and it‚Äôs disappointing that this wasn‚Äôt corrected while they were being beta tested. I can‚Äôt imagine it being cost effective to ship replacement units out to folks constantly."
"LR3 issues getting ""stuck"" upside down for no reasonHi, LR3 Connected. Have had for a little over 2 years and love it. Works great w/two cats.

Getting the dreaded ""lets get stuck upside down with no litter"", which we at least get reliable ""clean cycle interrupted"" messages.

It's obviously after one of our two cats does their thing, but no cat or anything goes into the LR. I just observed. Cleaned it a month ago, so everything is fairly tidy and no sensor blocked.

Is there a way to debug this besides coming upstairs to a treat from our male cat? Our female usually acts funny and howls, I assume because she holds it in.

To reset? We have to un-plug and then hope when you re-plug, the bin goes into ""reset"" mode and can find the 0 datum on the rotating part. Sometimes, it requires multiple unplug<->plug, reset, cycles to get this to happen though."
"PSA LR4 owners: Ghost cats triggering the unit to cycle: A MUST READI have owned my LR4 about 6 weeks so far.  Thankfully I read this sub for a bit before my unit arrived so I saw was the unit should be on some type of flat surface.

For the most part it is has been ok experience for me (please note I never updated the firmware on it a couple weeks back and to do this day I haven‚Äôt either).

But in the beginning I had the ghost cat cycling sporadically (2-3x a day) and looking at my camera (which doesn‚Äôt point directly at the LR4) I wouldn‚Äôt see either of our 2 cats even in the area.  Even looking at the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô in the app, there would no cat weights recorded.  A lot of people have been putting indoor security cameras pointing at their LR4‚Äôs to see when the kitties use the LR.  But the IR sensors from the security cameras that look at the LR4 mess with the 3 cat sensor beams that come from the top of the hood and trigger the unit to cycle with no cats present üò¢.

Small background, my LR4 is in our finished basement but in a utility room on the original cement floor.  At first I was having ghost cycling problems and the unit stopping mid cycle and getting stuck as well.  Upon further troubleshooting I realized I had the LR4 directly on the cement floor, yes, but the floor was sloped a good deal because it was near the French drain sump pump pit .  So then I moved it a bit and put a very thick plastic kitchen cutting board (from Amazon / so I could more easily clean+sanitize it VS plywood) underneath it and the cutting board was fairly long so it spanned the top of my underground sump pump pit + cover.  It worked pretty well there for 4 weeks or so until we had 5 straight days of rain and then sump pump started running with frequency. Then the LR4 started the ghost cycling again.  It took 1-2 days for me realize but even though it was on a thick plastic cutting board spanning a solid cement floor,  just the slight vibrations from the sump pump running was causing the ghost cycling.  On Tuesday I moved it to another part of the utility room and put the cutting board underneath it directly onto the cement floor and have not had one ghost cycle since.

So in short, my PSA after using the LR4 for about 6 weeks is it is SUPER SENSITIVE, so possibly even if your LR4 is on a 1st, 2nd, 3rd floor etc, if the floor just moves slightly sometimes to people in the house, things being moved around, etc I will cause the LR4 to sense something which then triggers the unit to cycle.  In the 2 days I had the LR4 on plywood spanning the underground sump pump, it probably ghost cycled 40-50 times.

In all of those 40-50 times never once in the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô did it ever log anything I saw so from the ghost cycling perspective it doesn‚Äôt help with troubleshooting.

Additionally, they may need to put out a firmware update so it isn‚Äôt so sensitive?!?  Don‚Äôt really know what the fix will be but not everyone has a solid cement level floor to put it on.

So in short, it the LR4 isn‚Äôt perfectly level and near any type of vibration it‚Äôll contribute to the ghost cycling.

Just wanted to share this information to help everyone in this sub!

"LR4 won't weigh cat and other issuesI've put in a support ticket, but fairly certain I won't get a response anytime soon, so figured it's worth asking here. 

After setting up the LR everything in terms of the machine itself seems to work fine. However, the app control basically doesn't work at all. I can't change any of the settings (cycle delay and light) from the app. It says it has a firmware update, and I've pressed it many times and nothing happens. I've unplugged the unit multiple times. I've re-boarded multiple times, nothing works. 

The most annoying thing is it doesn't weigh my cat. Paid $700 for this product, it's pretty annoying that this isn't working. Any ideas what I might be missing to get it to grab a weight?"
"6 plant based litters that work with the litter robot, and which works the bestDISCLAIMER: Litter Robot does not advise the use of plant based litters in they LR3 due to the potential for moisture build up on electronic components. In their FAQs they recommend cleaning more frequently to avoid this condensation, but do be aware you do this at your own risk. 



So I've gone through an ordeal trying to find the best plant based litters that work with my litter robot 3. I formerly used okocat in my traditional litter box and while it was a perfect litter in that setting, it doesn't work with the litter robot. I personally hate clay litter so that was immediately out for me, I don't like that they strip mine for cat poop sand and I dislike how it's dusty and I've never found it does well with odor. Just my opinion, but this is why I'm offering my experience, in case anyone feels the same as I do. 

1. Sustainably yours multicat (red label) 

This stuff clumps like a dream and doesn't stick at all. Unfortunately it doesn't do great with odor and I did have a fair amount of tracking (I don't mind a little tracking, it's kind of to be expected in my opinion) as the LR is in my bedroom I couldn't deal with the smell. 

2. Sustainably yours multicat plus (purple label) 

Pretty much the same issue as the red label, the odor was not well managed and I decided to try something else

3. Grass seed (so phresh brand)

Clumps well, but sticks to the liner and smells about the same, not even like ammonia, just weird. Not a favorite

4. Naturally fresh ultra odor control (yellow label)

Works wonders for smell, unfortunately it's dusty and sticks. Also, due to my main LR using cat being all white, he'd frequently have dark brown dust on his feet and his eye corners. 

5. Naturally fresh quick clumping (green label)

Same pros and cons as the other walnut litter, it sticks and is dusty. Even with Litter Care, both walnut litters stick.

6. World's best cat litter multicat (blue label, lotus blossom scent. It was on sale and my cat isn't picky)

I've used worlds best before, and I never really had too many gripes with it. It clumps well, doesn't stick, though it can mold if you're not careful. Truly I can't even tell that this litter is scented either, so it's not super overly perfumey which I dislike. It is a bit dusty but the dust doesn't seem to stick to my cat nearly as much.

All in all, world's best is my current top pick for a natural litter. Do keep in mind your mileage may vary, and since my cat has decided that he no longer has to squat to pee, that could definitely contribute to the sticking issues I experience. If anyone has any other recommendations that I could try, I'd definitely be down, especially if they're available at a petco. I should add that my boy is not a picky pee-er, so changing litter like this truly doesn't bother him."
"Message to CEOMr.  Zuppke,

Thank you for the recent message to your customers. It helps to know that you recognize you have a problem. I think most of your customers like the concept of your product and want to see you succeed. I personally have been a loyal customer for five years. I'm sure, however, that you can sense the level of frustration on this forum.

What would best address that frustration is more frequent, candid communication. The LR4 is undeniably flawed--or, at a minimum, unreliable--and seems to have been released prematurely. You must be working on fixes, but please let us know that. You are advertising heavily and presumably increasing sales while cutting back on customer support. That's not a good optic. It may help you get over short-term hurdles but risks damaging your reputation long-term. Moreover, continuing to send out faulty units will only compound your problem. 

You might be able to reduce returns and even support tickets if you would frequently reassure us that you're working on a solution to specific problems, such as the red bar of death, the frequent loss of WiFi connectivity, the overly sensitive sensors, or the globe getting stuck in an unusable position, to name a few. If some problems are insurmountable, it would be a show of respect to let customers know so that they can make informed decisions. Just communicate. 

Please. I have loved your products, the creative ingenuity of your ideas, and the excellent customer service you had in the past. Please make it all work again."
"My cats hate my investment. Help!So we have 3 cats. Obviously we're good candidates for the litter robot, right?
I bought one back in May. We had 3 foster cat at the time so I knew LR couldn't handle all that. We got rid of 1 giant box and replaced it with LR. So we had LR right next to our other giant litter box.
Things were so so. I avoided scooping the old box until absolutely necessary. I set up our ring camera and only 2 of the 6 cats would use it. I figured I'd have a long acclimation time until our fosters were adopted. Kept the old box nice and dirty to encourage things in the meanwhile.
Well the fosters are gone. We now just have LR. Now I have cats peeing in sinks and dog crates. Just this morning a cat shit next to the LR. Why

"Cat pooping on floor instead of Litter Robot - plz helpI‚Äôm needing some advice for our cat Poppy who is pooping on the floor instead of in our Litter Robot. We‚Äôve had the robot for 3+ years and our 3 cats have loved it, until recently Poppy will pee in the box but won‚Äôt poop in it. I think it‚Äôs because her butt hangs out of the box, and her poops fall out of the box and down the steps, which stresses her out. Our other two cats are smart and face their butts to the back of the robot, Poppy isn‚Äôt the brightest kitty and doesn‚Äôt know to turn around. 

I moved the robot to a different room to see if it would reset her brain, it did work and she tried to poop in the box but the poops went down the steps and now she is pooping on the floor again. I blocked all the spots she tried to poop and closed the doors to all rooms except the litter robot room, now she is just walking around holding all her poops in.

Hi i have two little babies, brother and sister, almost 1 year old! i was considering getting an automatic litter because cleaning litter is the bane of my existence (given my adhd and other health problems i often forget to clean it and when i do it is somewhat physically demanding for me). 

however this is also a very very expensive investment so i wanted to ask what differences between LR3 ($499), LR3-connect($549), and LR4 ($699) need to be considered beyond just the price? also are there any other robots that are cheaper but still good? 

also given that it is a machine what are concerns with mechanical or software failures or improvements? is it harder to fix LR3 bc it is older/less common? does it make more sense to invest in LR4 because it is the current focus of the company?

idk if this matters but if it does: a little about my kitties, they are very chill and friendly with each other, they tend to make a mess outside the litter bc they dig and swat at the litter after and it gets out of the entrance (i think it‚Äôs just one of them but i never catch her in the act). i don‚Äôt think them getting acclimated will be an issue, they are pretty chill and are actually amused/intrigued by my vacuum(?). they are approx 10 and 14lbs per my best guess."
Just received my first LR3 and need some help that I can‚Äôt find an answer to online.I have 2 8 month olds and they have used Feline Pine CLUMPING litter ( not the pellets ) since I got them. Will it work in my LR3? I bought a thing of Tidy Cats Clumping Litter just in case it didn‚Äôt.  If the feline pine doesn‚Äôt work is the tidy cats a good choice or should I get something else? Thanks
"Help - Pinch sensor / rapid blinking yellowI came home from a trip, fired up my Litter-Robot 3 (no wifi, off warranty) for my little guy, and I got a slow blinking blue light.  I hit reset, and it changes to rapidly blinking yellow.  Reset flips between the two kinds of blink; and hard resets like power on/off or unplugging the unit don‚Äôt change anything.

Fast forward, google says that this is a pinch sensor malfunction.  I‚Äôve disassembled the unit and cleaned the metal pinch sensor arms; I‚Äôve bent the
arms back into contact,and I‚Äôve tried taping/zap strapping the arms together to bypass the sensor.


No luck so far.  I‚Äôm incredibly frustrated.  The only next move I can think of is to trying to connect the sensors together at the wire, prior to the arms (skipping them completely), or order whole new arms.  Unless the board is damaged and I need a whole new DFI assembly?

I‚Äôm at a total loss for ideas on what I can try to troubleshoot wether it‚Äôs the arms, or something else in the wire, or something else completely in the unit and how deep I have to ordering replacements.

Help liner on litter robot 4 is rippedThis freaking sucks man. I deep clean it twice a month and I find this. I have only had this since November. Duct tape and glue will not work:/
"Has anyone added any more weight to the preinstalled metal weight on the underside of the LR3 rubber liner to help the bottom ""flop down"" when it cycles?I've noticed that over the last few months, the rubber bottom of my LR3 has stopped flopping down to help knock off any clumped urine.  I did a deep clean of the whole thing today, but it still isn't flopping.  I got underneath the rubber skin to look at what the weight looked like.  There's nothing causing it to stick, and it wasn't dirty at all.  

I was tossing the idea around of taping a few lead weights to the existing weight to help the bottom flop down.  Anyone else ever try this?"
"Onboarding Help!Hi!!

I just recently purchased a new LR3 for my cats, this being our second unit. The whisker website recommends that for smooth onboarding of a second unit to unplug the first unit, reboot your modem/router, plug in the second unit, and begin onboarding. 

Well‚Ä¶ I did that and now my first LR3 is not in the app and I cannot onboard it because the serial is already in use (by me). I‚Äôve tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app, logging in and out of the app, crying, and contacting whisker support. However, whisker support is closed right now so I‚Äôm waiting on an email back.

"""Movement detected in the bin"" - stupid LR4 is freezing in the dump orientation! Help!All of a sudden today my LR4 has decided to spam that error and freeze flipped over where the waste bin is exposed, meaning I have no usable litter box if I keep it plugged in. I tried re-seating the orb, pulling out the waste bin and putting it back in, there is nothing visibly wrong! Even if I spam the buttons until it finally cycles through to ""finish a cycle"", it instantly starts another cycle and freezes again!

Has anyone run into this? Any tips on how to fix? Thanks!"
"help with naughty catso to preface, i actually just got a leo‚Äôs loo too but there isn‚Äôt a subreddit for it and was hoping y‚Äôall could still help since the way they work is pretty similar ü•≤

i just got my box like three days ago, one of my cats took right to it. used it, jumped out, ignored it while it did it‚Äôs cycle. perfect little man. 

my other cat however is a menace. he jumps in it a thousand times while it‚Äôs cycling, i got a notification at work every 2 minutes that kitty was using it. i know it stops and starts back when he gets out and it‚Äôs usually fine‚Ä¶but the other day i woke up to it frozen with the chute down and all the litter hidden away and a notification of an ‚Äúobstruction‚Äù i knew right away that the obstruction had to have been pumpkin. turns out while it was in this position he noticed that there was a fun plastic bag through the chute and literally stuck his head in it and shredded it up. he also ripped one of the fuzzy things that help the globe rotate smoothly off the wall and it ended up in the litter drawer as well.

since then i have forgone the bags, figure i‚Äôll let him think they don‚Äôt exist anymore and then eventually start using them again once he quits messing with it. i also have switched it to manual mode so i can just run it when i‚Äôm home and keep an eye on him, but how can i train/encourage him to leave it alone? do i just have to wait for him to get bored of it? i really want to be able to switch it to auto mode so it can run on its own if we ever take a weekend trip but i‚Äôm scared of him causing it to freeze up without any available litter to use.

"Help I did everything wrongThis is going to be a bit long. This is a confession of me getting flustered and doing poor litter box transitions. I absolutely recognize my cat‚Äôs behaviors is because of me

Last Saturday I setup my 1st Litter Robot. At first it started ok. Neither of the 2 cats were interested in it and would only use the old box. I got a bit disappointed and decided to change locations when my one cat started peeing on the machine, not in it but on it. I cleaned it up and closed off the old room and put the LR in a new location where I could see if they used it. 

One started to use it and one refused and literally went anywhere else. I got mad when he peed on my boardgame collection and once again moved the box. Now I‚Äôm back to square one again with neither cat wanting to use the LR. 

Is there anyway to salvage this or should I just send it back and forget about it?

TLDR:   I screwed up getting my cats use to Litter Robot and now neither wants to use it. Any advice on how to get them to use it"

My dog was helping me scoop the litter. I have it set to 30 minutes to let the waste dry but maybe I need to set it to 15 minutes...
"Positive result with customer serviceBack when the LR4 was in preorder, I bought it. And since then it‚Äôs been riddled with issues. Most of them just kinda ‚Äòresolved themselves‚Äô.

Did all the prescribed troubleshooting before contacting customer service. 

First they sent a free bonnet. It was definitely a new design. The press tabs on the side had ribs to aid with grip. But that didn‚Äôt solve the problem. So I let them know and they sent me a brand new base for free. No inner globe but all I had to do was transfer that over and set up a new LR4 on the app. ‚ÄúMarvin 2.0‚Äù. So far zero problems.

"I think I beansed the Pinch Detector reset... I need help. I'm tapping out.First off: **I have submitted a ticket with the official support team. Seeing as it's after work-hours, I'm hoping I might get a temporary/immediate fix while I wait for a response-- even if it is a band-aid.**

Here's the backstory:

I started getting Drawer-full notifs after *just* changing the litter last week. That lead up into the Pinch Detected at startup error. Did all the troubleshooting, factory-reset, filed the pinch pins, nothing. The unit *will not move*.

Symptoms:

* On BOOT: Yellow Flashing Light (QUICK)
* App Notice: Pinch Detected at Startup (Power Cycle & Factory Reset)
* Regular Reset: Reverts to ""Drawer Full"" when bin inserted. When NO bin inserted, stays on Pinch Detected.

What I've already done:

* Completely removed litter bin/bag. Didn't think it was the problem but worth a try.
* Complete disassembly/clean.
* Specifically targeted clean of DFI sensor covers. Did notice residue, has been removed.
* Complete *full replacement* with new Pinch Sensor metal pins. The new ones **Are Touching.**
* Factory Resets/Power Cycles/Soft Resets, you name it.

What do I do from here... what am I missing? Please.. I need help. I'm disabled and I don't even have a damn scoop anymore. I'm struggling. It's already in pieces. Name it and I'll *do it*. I don't know what else to do at this point and I've always been quick to panic when something goes wrong. Considering I've been using toilet paper to scoop a litter box since Thursday, I'd say I'm handling this okay.

EDIT 10/28/21: They never responded via chat after 4x 5h waiting periods in chat. The verdict is: **Full DFI + Pinch Detector Replacement**."
"Litter Robot 3 EnclosureAll,

My wife and I need to move the cat box due to an incoming little person who is sadly taking over our furry friends litter box room/office. We wanted to get a Litter Robot 3 to aid us in how many times we need to clean the small creatures in the house, but we have a small house and would prefer it not in the open. We are saving up and like the idea of the LitterRobot as a friend of ours like her's a lot. 

Has anyone found a litter box enclosure other the the ones sold by litter robot that fits the litter robot 3? We want one in white or black and it will likely live near the front door as a key stand type thing or in the living room corner as an ""end table"" or ""cabinet"". My wife isn't a fan of the look or cost of the ones sold by litter robot and so I wanted to reach out to the cat/reddit community for ideas!

[Example of one we liked but too small for Litter Robot 3](https://www.wayfair.com/pet/pdp/archie-oscar-huckabee-litter-box-enclosure-w001753299.html?piid=296800661)

"The secret to a smell-free litter robotEverything I did didn‚Äôt do anything to help the smell until I replaced the rubber liner in the box. I can now be sitting directly next to the box and not smell anything. This is such a game changer and I‚Äôm wondering why this isn‚Äôt talked about more! Figured I‚Äôd share to help out others!

Edit: This is for owners with older robots. My LR is over 3 years old so this won‚Äôt apply to everyone. I had fully taken it apart and soaked it in various enzyme Natures Miracle products for days, spraying every other hour, then a full Lysol disinfectant soak for a day; unfortunately after all that work the smell still was there."
"Cleaning cycle constantly interrupted by furI had my LR4 for a little more than 2 weeks now and my cat is using it just fine. Lately I have noticed that the LR4 will stop mid cleaning cycle with red lights, wihout anyone near it. It seems it reacts to fur from my cat being stuck either at the sensors or at the fence. Really disappointed that it's this sensitive and that I can't rely on it doing what it's supposed to do. I have been trying to wipe the sensors and fence with a microfiber-cloth, but it only works for a little while. Am I the only one with this problem?"
"What to do about my cats ripping up their LR4 rubber globe linerI've had a LR4 for about 3-4 months, and after using it one+ of them just scratches at the sides which has now created holes in the rubber where the rubber meets the plastic (3 and 9 o'clock)...no matter the box they're using they always scratch the sides from 3 and 9 o clock downwards. 

I did send pictures to Whisker and they sent me a replacement glove, which I haven't installed yet. I am trying to plan my next steps concerning:

1) Prevention 
-Trim my cats nails
-Put something on top of rubber to protect it

2) Repair 
-I tried to cover the damage with gorilla tape but it doesn't stick to the rubber

I do have the warranty and I did extend it during purchase but I don't want to have to rely on the manufacturer to keep sending me new globes for my cats to tear through.

Thank for any feedback/guidance!!!"
"Constant cat sensor faults - LR4I‚Äôm not sure what do to do about the constant cat sensor faults I‚Äôm experiencing. I feel like I can‚Äôt rely on my cats having access to the robot while I‚Äôm out. I did take some litter out and reset and it seemed to help a bit but I‚Äôm getting several to a bunch of cat sensor faults every day and I have observed that they aren‚Äôt caused by my cats. Help?!

Update: I vacuumed the sensors and haven‚Äôt had an issue for the last few days."
"Extremely Disappointed with the Recent Lack of SupportI know this has been talked about before but it‚Äôs a bit out of hand at this point. I have an LR3 and wanted to order the LR4 before I saw all the issues it was having shortly after launch. In the mean time my second LR3 which was replaced about 6 months ago started to have issues with the cat sensor. I reached out to support several times and never heard back, before posting this i messaged u/litterrobot directly via Reddit and was told my issue would be escalated, haven‚Äôt heard a thing since. 

This is beyond frustrating, there is no support via email, no access to chat, and no way to call. I understand growing pains and I think all of us here come from a place of understanding and willingness to ride out the storm because we believe in the company. However there is a fine line between being understanding and also having a fair expectation for support on a very pricey product. At this point I don‚Äôt think is too much to ask for at least a response in 24/48hrs. It‚Äôs been a week since I reached out and my issue was escalated. 

I believe this is a product that we come to rely on very much. This issue came up a week before me going on a trip and I did everything I could to find a resolution before leaving. I am now having to figure out how manage my litter situation while I am away. My plans to purchase a new LR4 are out of the picture and my expectation and ideas that the company will do what‚Äôs right are gone."
"Does the LR4 still use metal sensors? Our LR3 is driving me nutsLong story short our LR3 keeps setting off pinch detector and cat sensor faults.

We've had it for years, and I've done all the hacks online for the pinch detector but at this point it happens daily and I'm just over it.

So those familiar with both, does the LR4 have that stupid pinch detector still (always seemed useless since the robot stops anyway when weight is applied), and does it rely on metal for it's detectors or is it all infrared lasers now?

TIA"
"When to remove old litterbox?Hello, my kitten has used the litterbot in front of me and when I'm not looking but also still uses the dirty litterbox (which I stopped cleaning to get her to use the new litterbot). When is a good time to reliably take the old litterbox away and solely rely on the litterbot? I was thinking of just doing it now since she uses it but sometimes I catch her sitting in it and doing nothing."
"anyone have an old internal shield I can buy?If this isn't allowed, mods, please let me know....I dont have FB so I have to rely on reddit haha
An internal shield is nothing that whiskers offers anymore and their recommendation was either to try to buy one off another person that wasn't using it, or try a pheromone spray and see if it helps

I will definitely try the spray but if anyone has an internal shield they aren't using, I would love to purchase it from you."
"LR3 waste drawer wasted ( space)Has anyone else noticed that when the Litter Robot 3 drops the waste into the drawer it primarily lands in the upper left quarter of the box?  

On my unit ( one adult cat) this can trigger the full sensor in as little as two days since the waste piles up right at the chute instead of using more of the drawer space. Been like this since I bought it two years ago. This forces me to either change the bag before it should be necessary or I can pull the drawer and 'shimmy' the waste to the far side. 

Can this be right? Any solutions? 

With frequent bag changing it feels like I'm adding more plastic than necessary to our environment. And it's concerning if I want to rely on it to work while out of town for a long weekend."
"Feeder Robot battery lifeHas anyone tested the practical battery life of the Feeder Robot?  It says 24 hours, which seems woefully low.  If power went out on a multi-day trip, I'd have to make sure someone is able to come feed them manually, several times a day.  I love the design of the robot otherwise, with features like food level monitoring, wifi control in the same app as my LitterRobots, front panel overrides, etc.  My current SafePets units work off 4 D batteries + wall power.  And the D batteries will last 6+ months if you relied on them.  I was hoping the backup unit the FeederRobot could at least handle a week.  I wonder if the battery could be upgraded somehow (warranty voided of course).  Thoughts and experience are appreciated.  With wifi alerts, I guess I would know if the power went out.  Maybe I'm overthinking it."
"No outlet for Litter RobotI'm moving to a new place and considering getting a litter robot for the 2nd floor. Unfortunately there aren't any outlets in the area where I'd like to place the Robot so I'm considering maybe getting an indoor generator to power the device. 

Has anyone had success with this? Or does anyone have any alternative ideas? I'd rather not have to rely on an old school litter box but it does seem like that may be my only option."
"Altering the Litter Robot?My single kitty is older, so she probably uses the box twice as often as a younger cat. So the volume is the same, but the frequency is higher. If I have to go away on business or vacation, I wanted this to last her about a week, as advertised. But my problem is that the receptacle fills up after 2-3 days. So I have some questions:

1. Firstly, does this box measure fullness by the number of times it cycles, or does it rely solely on the height of the pile? I'm tempted to clear the full alert and see how long it goes before it becomes a problem.

2. Secondly, (and it hurts to ask this), could you conceivably cut out the bottom of the tray, put the LR on a slightly elevated platform so that the bag would hang lower, thus collecting more waste before tripping the sensor?"
"App not turning LR3 back onSo we have the LR3 Connect and the app. Everything has been going great, except for the last 4 days.

We went on vacation 5 days ago and wont be back for another 3. We have someone coming by to feed our cats, but they arent around enough to make sure the LR is operating as it should.

The LR has suddenly been giving us multiple cat sensor interrupted faults, and will get stuck for hours. I am guessing once it was stuck upside down for too long and one of my cats pooped outside the box (according to cat sitter).

I thought I had a smart idea by turning on and off the LR remotely with my app... so that we limit the cycles to twice a say. But it wont turn back on via the app!

Obviously something is wrong with the LR that will need us to troubleshoot and clean when we get home, but I'm hoping theres a quick fix to this power on issue in the meantime!

It will also be really annoying if I cant ever rely on the app in the future to turn the LR on and off when I need to."

"Give me your honest truth!My husband and I are in disagreement about whether or not to get a litter robot because he claims it has horrible reviews. Now, I‚Äôve read the bad reviews, but they seem to be the minority. From what I can tell, the majority of people who have a litter robot love it. 

I am most likely going to buy one regardless since he‚Äôs never scooped litter in his life and it‚Äôs my realm of management anyway. 

BUT I would like to know allllll the pros and cons before I buy since it is prettyyyyy expensive lol.

I've found that the inside construction has a lot of crevices where no matter how many times I cycle or empty, litter still gets trapped. From the photos, it looks like this may be resolved in the LR4, but I can't really tell."
"Honest Litter Robot 3 long-term reviewWith the Litter Robot 4 on the horizon, I thought I'd share my honest long-term review of the previous version after having used it for the last 3 years.

# What's Great

* ***Your litter cleaning chores are drastically reduced***  
I went from having to clean my litter box every day to cleaning the box once a week. This is a huge time saver and it makes taking care of cats much easier.  
This is especially if you have pet sitters while you're on vacation - if you're gone for a week, they won't have to clean any litter at all, and if longer, they'll have to do it maybe once or twice.  

* ***Being able to check your cat's usage metrics is great***  
I've learned that my cat uses the bathroom a lot less when I'm on vacation (probably sleeping all day), and have been able to track if she's had irregular bathroom use. The historical data is useful to get a good sense for how much you expect your cat is using the bathroom and whether they're going more or less often than normal.  

* ***Cleaning mechanism still works great***  
Despite the abuse from my cats (i.e. trying to use the litter box while it's rotating, attacking falling poop), the mechanisms for cleaning out the litter still work great. I'm pleasantly surprised by how well it's still functioning after all these years.

# What's Not

* ***It will SMELL***  
It was great at first: hardly any litter smells, recommended deep clean once a month.  
But after 3 years of use, the litter robot smells very quickly/easily no matter how hard I try to deep clean the thing. As with certain types of plastic products, bacteria builds up over time and seems to more easily hold on to that bacteria the more you use it, and this is true for the litter robot.  

* ***TRULY deep cleaning this thing is a pain in the ass***  
It looks easy from all the marketing videos that you're shown, but if you really want to clean this thing well, it's going to take you a over an hour (and you'll want to do this more frequently as your Litter Robot ages).
   * The base can't be sprayed down with water and does not dismantle easily, so you'll be sticking your hands into corners to try to get at the weird angles, while smelling cat piss all around you.
   * The globe seems easy to clean but there are several spots that are a significant hassle to get to which aren't advertised as areas you need to clean - under the rubber bottom of the globe, and under the sifting area (where the litter slides into during a cycle).
   * There's also gasket foam that's used to prevent the sifted litter from falling out of the edges of the hole. I had to take apart the sifter piece and I accidentally damaged the foam, so I had to use my own rubber sealing (same ones used for insulating doors) to get a solid gasket in place.
   * You HAVE to clean these areas because they build up smell over time.  
(There are zero instructional videos on how to do any of this by the way)  

* ***Cats can stop the cleaning cycle***  
If you have a really playful cat (especially younger ones), expect them to attempt to crawl into the LR while it's running. This will cause it to stall and sometimes not resume without user intervention (needs a full power cycle).  

* ***The WiFi controls do not work the way you want when you need it***  
If your litter robot gets stuck and needs the power to be cycled to resume it, you can't use the remote controls to turn off (it just completely turns off the unit and you have to physically turn it on again). That's a pretty glaring issue with the hardware/software design.  
I've solved this by installing a separate wi-fi controlled power plug that I can cycle power on, but then what's the point of even giving me the power option in the app if I can't turn it back on??  

* ***Being limited to using clay litter sucks***  
I used to use wood litter for my cats. They're lighter, produce less dust, naturally eliminate odors much better, and are much more environmentally friendly.  
I've absolutely hated having to switch back to clay litter with the LR and wish I had a way to continue using my wood pellet litter. It would be nice if the sifting piece had alternative, adjustable sizes for different kinds of litter.

# TLDR; Summary

I've really liked using the LR, but I really expected more longevity with the amount of money I spent on this thing. My 3 main issues with the LR are: build of smell over time, hassle with ***true*** deep cleaning, and limited litter choice.

If you're sensitive to smells like me, you'll end up spending more time cleaning your LR as it ages. I'm at the point where I'm making a plan to switch back to a regular litter boxes - at least I can properly and easily deep clean those, AND I'm not spending over $500 if I need to replace it because of odor issues.

I don't own the LR4, but from what I've seen in the marketing videos, these issues don't look like they've been fixed (i.e. still can't easily remove the rubber bottom, still can't easily remove the sifting area, still looks like cheap plastic that will eventually hold onto smells, still can't use different non-clay litters).

I would have highly recommended this when I first got it, but unless you want to either be a) spending over an hour deep cleaning your litter box every month, or b) spending another over half a grand on a new LR, I don't recommended getting one."
"mundane positive LR4 review\- had a lot of trouble getting my cat to use the LR4 at first 

\- the switch back to clay based litter was a little rough (was on Okocat before) 

\- two sensor fault scares that... just went away. still a little worried about what happened there 

but other than that, I haven't had any issues with the LR4. it sits in my spare bathroom and I will forget about it until I get the drawer full alert, which is about once per week. I still like getting the notifications so I can check frequency and make sure all is going well in cat-bowels-land, but honestly this thing has been very pleasant and useful. with this and a simple auto feeder, I've been able to leave my cat alone for up to 4-5 day long weekends with no issues. her poops are absolutely demonic on the dry food required by the feeder, but that's a) my fault and b) resolved with the LR4 itself. 

just thought I'd leave some thoughts for other prospective buyers as I know usually we only post here with questions or problems."
"How to get your litter robot set up for success.This is my third litter robot, brand new, model 3 without Wi-Fi. One is working just fine, and the other needs some parts.

To be honest, I've taken my robots for granted for a while now. With too many cats using one, it can get pretty messy. So here's my question: how can I set up a new litter robot for success? Specifically, is there a way to disable some of the sensors without losing any of the functionality?

As you may have guessed, it's that weird sensor that always seems to get covered in cat litter during the cleaning cycle. Any ideas or advice?""

Edit+  just a quick reminder to myself: don't go overboard with the cleaning liquids on the metal part of the litter robot. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!"""
"One of my cats won't use the box and I'm afraid of a UTII have 2 Siberians- an 8 year old and a 1 year old. My 8 year old has taken to the box just fine (other than interrupting the cycle out of curiosity). My 1 year old was apprehensive, but when we removed the old litterbox, he seemed to be better. He went 3 times with me luring him in with treats and toys, and even one time all by himself. But in the last 3 days he refused to go in at all. He pooped on the floor and did not pee for over a day. My husband and I were scared he would get a UTI so we put his old box back out (which is a jump-in style privacy box), and he's used that 3 times in just 12 hours. 

I'm thinking that the problem is he's a pretty big boy (15 lbs) and very furry. Two of the times he used the robot, he ended up with peepee fur around his butt, which never happened in his old box. I think this may have deterred him from using the robot. He's honestly a big dummy and just might not understand how to use it without getting dirty. Any tips to get him back in without risking a UTI?"
"Fence that's being send out for backwards peeing cats is an absolute failI just received the ""new"" fence in the mail that is supposed to help with pee leaking down into the unit in between the seal and the outside case. It's just a piece of clear plastic taped to the original fence, but it seemed to not cover the area properly when I installed it. Tested it with water and a syringe to see what happens and it's an absolute fail, the water leaked right down inside the unit again. 

I reached out to the support and the response they gave me was that they are working on a solution and that the unit essentially wasn't designed for cats who face any other way as butt in and face out. Honestly ridiculous given that we pay a hella lot of money for this thing. You can't just assume that a cat is gonna behave in xy way and always pees in a certain position, thats not how cats work. Given how long people complain about this issue you would think they have it resolved by now, but nope. 

If anyone knows a 3rd party seller that offers a solution please let me know, I'm unfortunately not 3D printer savvy, but I would assume the original fence design with just an angled extra piece in the back that hangs over the gap would do. Heck, if you're someone who can design something like that I'm ready to throw my money at you, I just really want a solution for this problem."
"Honest opinions for LR3 + smell preventionI‚Äôve been debating getting a LR for years. I have two cats. Old fashioned boxes and scooping are the bane of my existence, especially because I always feel like I can smell it regardless of how often the boxes get deep cleaned. I hate having gatherings because I‚Äôm paranoid of being nose blind to the smell. 

I‚Äôve been wanting to wait for the LR4, but it‚Äôs taking forever so I might just get the LR3. My plan is to keep the LR in our 2nd floor laundry room. 

What are your honest thoughts on smell? What tips do you have and what litter have you had best results with?"
"Poop Sticking to DrumPlease help. We are at our wit‚Äôs end. We adopted an 8 month old Bengal, our second,  and his poop is all constantly all over the drum. He poops in the litter, but during the clean cycle it streaks everywhere. I think the problem is he is a big cat (12 pounds) and eats like a tank while he is still growing. We are having to scrub down the side of the box several times a day to stop the smell. Our whole office reeks. 

We‚Äôve tried changing the delay time to 30 minutes to allow more clumping time, and we‚Äôre using Arm and Hammer Clump & Seal which seems well-liked in this sub. Honestly, when we only had one cat using it the box still had a musty odor. We can empty out the tray and within a couple uses, the room smells like stale cat pee. 

We are using the LR4, bought in October and I feel like we wasted our money. Between the smell and poop-covered drum, we‚Äôre doing more work than before. Help. üò≠ I read all the threads with similar questions and none of the suggestions for odor or streaking have helped."
"Which litter robot to purchase?I‚Äôm currently looking into buying a litter robot and I know some people having issues. I just wanted to know, right now, which litter robot has the least problems? I see a lot of people comment that have the LR 3 and 4. I have two cats and this is a big investment so I‚Äôd like some honest opinions. 

I already know that I‚Äôll have to deep clean it once a month and that I might have to trouble shoot every so often, but I‚Äôm OCD about the litter boxes and have to scoop all of them several times a day and I think it‚Äôll still be worth it for me in the end.

Any insight would be super great, and if any of you have promo or referral codes I‚Äôll gladly use those too."
"My house smells worse with LR4Unfortunately you get used to the smell of your own house but my mom came over and I asked her honestly what my house smelled like. 
I was mortified by the answer. It smells like a dirty little box‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had nothing but issues lately."
"Mold in waste basket... Switch litter?Hi everyone, I have a different automatic litter box (Petkit Pura X), but this sub is much larger so I thought I'd ask the LR community as well. Recently, I've seen white fuzzy mold grow in the waste basket (looks like cotton filling). I've been using Arm & Hammer Slide multicat purple box. Clumps well, great odor control, low tracking. I honestly loved it until mold started to grow in the waste basket of the automated box. (No issue in the regular boxes). 

Obviously the basket is an enclosed environment prone to fungi and bacteria. But has anyone found that switching litter solved it? I found old posts asking for help, but I'm not sure what if anything fixed their issue. AH has baking soda in it, so I would think it should prevent mold better than other litters, but maybe not? I'm looking into Boxiecat extra strength red and Dr Elsey. Has anyone fixed the mold problem? Is Boxiecat red better than pro for an automatic box because the clumps are supposedly harder? Which Dr Elsey works best in an automatic box as far as clumping, odor, and low tracking? Thank you!"
"Litter Robot Success Stories !I've been reading quite a few poor reviews about Litter Robots lately, and I agree with the thinking that people who are unhappy about an issue are overwhelmingly more inclined to write about it online than satisfied buyers who will simply enjoy their purchase and say nothing.

So to balance this out, lets post some success stories!

Ill go first.  My Litter Robot 3 went into service 3 years ago and I have had NO problems with it at all.  It's still working perfectly today. What's amazing is that I do about ZERO maintenance. I empty the drawer when the app reports it's full, and walk away for another week. I'm using Fresh Step clumping liter with Febreze.

In 3 years I have taken the LR3 apart and cleaned it outside twice. And honestly, it really didn't need it.

Lastly, NO I don't work for Whisker and this is not a paid endorsement. I'm just a guy who stopped scooping poop 3 years ago and couldn't be happier.

What's your success story ?"
"LR4 - smart scale is just wrong and can't resetGot the LR4, and to be honest the setup and first day has just been a series of frustrations.

Seems to be mostly functional now but the [smart scale](https://i.imgur.com/9WWEHo3.png) is just plainly incorrect. I have one big boy but he's not even a 5th of that weight!

The LR4 is on a hard floor not touching any walls. I've tried switching it off for 30 seconds in the hope it would reset. Tried that DFI recalibration as well all with no luck.

Is there some documentation on how to properly zero the scales?"
"Mold in LR4I've read a few threads on this but I'm still having issues.

I have a LR4 and am using boxiecat pro deep clean.  I have 1 cat. The entire robot sits on the [https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-mat.html](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-mat.html). I noticed that since the robot is entirely on the mat, it might be blocking the vents on the floor of the robot (the tiniest bit).

By 1 week there is white, cotton candy like mold in the drawer (using a plastic bag as liner).

The boxiecat pro deep clean litter doesn't really do a great job with smell which makes it seem like a great mold environment. Pre-robot I used smart cat grass litter and it didn't smell at all. I'm surprised w/ all the stellar reviews but honestly not loving this litter (besides it's great clumping/non sticking to the globe features). 

I sprinkle baking soda at the start of the week generously in the drawer. The robot is not near a humid environment.

Maybe I need a litter w/ baking soda pre-mixed? Or maybe move it off the mat entirely? I looked up reusable mini dehumidifiers but it won't fit in the drawer (Height dimension is limiting, only 5.5"".

Ideally I'd like to change the liner once a week w/o seeing the mold. Has anyone cracked this?

Thank you!!"
