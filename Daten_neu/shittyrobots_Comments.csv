"['That’s actually fairly clever', 'It’s a true story, but it’s not the “gotcha” people think.\n\nSure, pencils work in zero gravity. But they also become dull rather quickly and sometimes just snap, so for any longer missions you’d need either a sharpener (bad idea, I’ll get to that), or lots of spare pencils. Either way, it’s extra weight. Graphite is also electrically conductive. Writing with a pencil in zero gravity could throw all kinds of microscopic graphic dust into the air, which is a serious short risk (as well as a breathing hazard). This is why the sharpener is also a bad idea, because even an enclosed sharpener with space for storage will have *tons* of dust float out the hole when you pull the pencil out. Little wood shavings are also a huge fire hazard.\n\nA pen works fully until it starts running out of ink, it doesn’t break as easily, and it has none of those risks. You just have to solve the zero g problem.\n\nThe Russians did use a pencil, not because it was a better solution, but because they were cutting corners, which they did *a lot* in their space program. NASA’s first space capsule (Mercury Redstone) included heavy-duty two-stage parachutes that brought the entire capsule down safely. It was designed to make a water landing, with a deployable landing skirt for extra safety, and a smoke generator and dye pack to make the astronaut easy to locate for helicopter pickup.\n\nThe first Vostok capsule that carried Yuri Gagarin to orbit and back had no such provisions. The capsule had insufficient thrust to control its descent trajectory. Rather than making a controlled landing, Gagarin would eject from his capsule at 7km and manually parachute down on his own. He was miles off-target, and came down near a random farm and had to convince them he wasn’t a spy, and that he needed to find a phone to call Moscow.\n\nNASA would continue to refine and improve their re-entry capsules throughout the space program. By the Apollo program, re-entry trajectories were predictable enough that astronauts would be picked up within minutes of splashdown, by helicopters deployed from an aircraft carrier that was often in visual range of the landing point.\n\nIn that same timeframe, Soviet capsules continued to use the “eject at 7km” system, but the cosmonauts were given a gun, in case they landed in the tundra and encountered a bear.']"

In simple terms, there is a physics engine which knows the mass of each limb, and is being told to control the overall body\'s center of mass within a stable region of support (position and velocity and acceleration relative to the amount of support its feet have on the ground). So if it\'s tilting backwards, windmilling arms is an effective way of generating torque to counteract that lean, but if it\'s leaning too fast for the arms to counteract then it will need to take a step in order to change the base of support. \n\nIn math terms it gets insanely complex, but the overall concept of whole-body locomotion is pretty straightforward. It\'s akin more to a first-person video game in that moving the sticks changes the direction the body goes or stands tall or crouches, but you\'re not controlling each individual joint. \n\nBottom line: while the goal to jump or flip is programmed, the *exact* ~~step locations and~~ joint movements are not preprogrammed and fall out of the whole body controller.\n\nEdit: crossed out that foot positions aren\'t preprogrammed, since they very likely are goal inputs into the whole body controller.\n\nSecond edit: it\'s worth mentioning that whole-body controllers use a ""cost function"" to help guide certain behaviors. For instance, if a robot were to carry a cup of water in its hand, you can place a high cost constraint that the cup stays in an upright orientation and that rotational and translational acceleration (technically the derivative of acceleration, jerk) should be minimized. Depending on the relative costs of \'dont fall down\' to \'don\'t spill the water\', you could see a robot trip over a stick and either windmill both arms (spilling the water) or performing some ridiculous gymnastics to try not to \'spill your beer\' as it topples to the ground.', 'what are you talking about dude? the spot is just as capable as the atlas. it just doesn’t swing it’s arms around since, ya know, it doesn’t have arms.', ""Atlas isn't for sale. That helps."", 'I honestly feel like this kind of thing will eventually be programmed in.\n\nIt\'s completely unnecessary for the robot to function, but I think acting ""human"" like this would be a huge selling point.

It was given instructions how where to move to and what to do in general, but how it achieves those goals was entirely decided by the robot's 'brain'. So it might be told to move to X location and then do a backflip, but it will have to figure out itself what steps to take, how to balance, stay stable, and how to do the flip while also landing it properly."", ""But.. but the Tesla people said they're all preprogrammed movements and not real AI, unlike their robot!\n\n/s"", ""Evolution doesn't perfect things, it can only find local maxima, the best option that can be reached by small incremental changes that never harm the reproductive success of the animal.\n\nFor a very simple example, consider the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the giraffe. The vagus nerve starts in the brain stem, runs all the way down the entire neck, which then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve, goes under the aorta, and runs all the way back up the neck to the larynx. Why? Because it started in fish, where the equivalent structures were pretty close together, so it was a fairly direct route. But then our ancestors grew necks, the aorta got pulled down into the chest area, while the larynx ended up higher.\n\n(afaik, feel free to show me counter examples) It's been this way for every reptile, mammal, and dinosaur, always with a nerve taking the long way from the brain, through the entire neck and back, to get to the larynx. It's a ridiculously stupid design, unimaginable to any engineer, and we have it because there was no way for evolution to do anything about it without making things worse temporarily, and that's something it just can never do.\n\nEvolution is incredibly powerful, but it has one fundamental and inescapable flaw, it can only ***improve***, and only in small tiny changes.\n\nWhen we're designing a robot, we can decide to simply disconnect a wire, run it a different way, and reconnect it. It's an incredibly simple change that could easily improve things, but it's a guarantee that evolution will never make that improvement.\n\nThat's why evolution leaves gaping holes of imperfections on everything it touches, because it's a ball that can only roll uphill, and you can't get from the top of a hill to the top of Mount Everest without going downhill first."", 'Thanks for the details.

They didn\'t hardcode the position of every lane on every road, and they surely didn\'t hardcode the position of random obstacles that may appear on the road, right? The software is reacting in real time to novel situations constantly -> that is AI.\n\nYou must think AI means like sentience or consciousness - it does not, and were far, far away from that, if it even will be possible one day.\n\nSo in short, yes, your lane guidance software falls under the AI realm.']"

So while my direct boss does not expect me to be sitting at my desk and working for exactly 8 hours every day IT security says that the screen needs to lock after 5 minutes of inactivity, and if the screen locks then I get logged out of the VPN which logs me out of all of the tools that I use.

Especially since it can play any audio, it could narrate stories with different voices during storytime, play a song in diff pitches perfectly in music class. Augment lectures in biology with different sounds of big cats while discussing the differences between mating calls. \n\nGeneral language compression has gotten a lot better over the last decade. However until it reached a threshold of acceptable understanding, I would expect the teacher to handle q&a. But it would eventually get there. Think about when you click to chat on a website. More often than not you are speaking to a robot for a while until you stump it, and the human discreetly slides in. Many companies phone it in ands it\'s obvious, but some you\'d be surprised how well it can operate \n\n\nJust to discuss the computer vision/surveillance point. I think we need to look how many cameras are already present in schools, between phones to CCTV. I think we are leaving the ""should we"" have it and are already in the ""it\'s here how to deal with it."" I for one think that if there is that tech in the classroom we should utilize it to the benefit of everyone.  Currently the most optimal way of training the computer to recognize faces and expressions is through computer vision feeding a neural network. This is already vastly explored and implemented (see Snapchat filters). Even the technical challenges of determining race are being eroded with research and refinement. For the time being, especially while there is a human teacher in the room the computer would decide which student to help. It would report to the teacher a list of students that need aid. Whom to help first would still be a human decision and that ethical dilemma already exists.\n\nLastly I agree smaller classes are better. But in reality that isn\'t always an option. Look at 3rd world countries or overpopulated areas, or even colleges with lecture halls. Many times they shove as many bodies in as possible. \n\n--\n\nAlso another point I didn\'t bring up is that robots don\'t need to be paid a salary. Their licensing, maintenance, and other associated fees pale in comparison to even the least compensated employees. And so even if it stops as just a teacher\'s aid, that still means it\'s saving the school a lot of money because it doesn\'t need to higher someone else to help with the work.\n\n--\n\nTo be clear, I wouldn\'t want myself, or my kids to be taught by a robot. As the technology currently stands it\'s not ready. But this experimentation is writing on the wall for somebody\'s future. By the time the technology is more sophisticated, we as a society might have reevaluated the moral and ethical stance on these issues.\n\nIma go watch iRobot again', 'I appreciate your willingness to play devils advocate, not many people understand that standpoint trying to argue for a side that is clearly maladaptive.\n\n I have seen children enthralled with watching shows/cartoons, but again, this != learning. As per my points above, learning happens when we experience the world, enact our will upon it, and discover that what we expected to happen has changed. A lecture won\'t create this knowledge (or at least solidify it, a lecture can indeed teach you a concept, but it is ingrained/learned in practice). \n\nThe one thing you miss in your points, or rather don\'t play to the true importance of teaching, is  the teacher/student relationship being a key factor in students willingness/ability to learn. Similar to counselors with their patients, if a student doesn\'t have a positive relationship with their teacher, they won\'t learn as effectively (if at all). A robot cannot (I would argue ever) replace this human connection required for a learning relationship. \n\nOn your point on surveillance in the classroom, I believe you\'re misguided. To put this point further, ""we\'ve already lost 50K on our investment, might as well keep going"". Going down an dark path further simply because we are on it is a poor argument. I agree, facial recognition to catch emotions may help teachers, but at what cost to student privacy? (and further, to race?) How long will it take for these race based training algorithms to solve the problem that is present? It\'s already well known that AI recognizes white faces better than black, or asian, so will white students begin to perform better in school because the AI told the teacher to help a white student first, because it is faster at catching this confusion? This would further lead to inequalities that already exist in many classrooms. I\'m personally not comfortable implementing such a technology until it can be deemed to be more equitable, and even still, surveillance in the classroom is not the road general education should be going down. People deserve a fundamental right to privacy, and this is a huge erosion of this. \n\nOn the point of robots, (and in lower-economically developed countries) the robots are certainly not cheaper than employees, similarly, in a more developed country, they may be cheaper than a salary, but the quality of education produced is also far inferior. You get what you pay for. \n\nI disagree with your conclusion as well, similar to my point above with the teacher/student learning/mentoring relationship.']"

Or there are no violation of said laws nu Israel?\n\n\n...\n\n\n**UN Resolutions**\n\n\n\nIsrael is currently in breach of, or has been the subject of, over 30 UN Security Council resolutions directed at it alone for violations which it has never taken action to remedy.\n\n\n**Collective punishment**\n\n\n\nIsrael operates a military policy of collective punishment called the ‘Dahiya doctrine’, after the area in Lebanon where it was first used by Israeli forces in 2006. Simply put, the doctrine sees massive force being used upon the civilian population in order to exert political pressure on enemy forces. Aside from being a classic definition of the word “terrorism”, Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention defines collective punishment as a war crime, stipulating that “No persons may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited … Reprisals against persons and their property are prohibited.”\n\n\n\n**Settlements and Annexations**\n\n\n\nThe first Israeli settlements were built in late 1967, immediately following the military occupation of the Palestinian territories.  Today over half a million Jewish-Israelis live in such settlements. As Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that it is illegal for an occupying power to “deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”, all such settlements are thus war crimes. UN Security Council Resolution 446 declares settlements have “no legal validity”.\n\n\n\nIn 1980 Israel formally annexed East Jerusalem as Israel’s “complete and united” capital. UNSC Resolution 478 declares the annexation “a violation of international law” which is “null and void and must be rescinded.” UNSC Resolution 497 similarly states that Israel’s annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights in also illegal.  \n\n\n\n**The Wall**\n\n\n\nIn 2002 Israel began building 710km a barrier consisting of 8m high concrete walls, military watchtowers and barbed-wire fences on Palestinian land. Israel claims its purpose it to prevent Palestinians from crossing into Israel, but its route winds deep within the West Bank –only 15% of its route follows the Green Line border– leading  it to be dubbed the ‘land grab’ or ‘Apartheid’ wall. In 2004, the International Court of Justice (The World Court) issued an Advisory Opinion regarding the legality of the wall, stating that the wall “and its associated régime, are contrary to international law” and called for reparations for those affected by its construction.\n\n\n\n**Right of Refugees’ Return**\n\n\n\nBetween 1947 and 1949 Jewish-Israeli military forces ethnically cleansed at least 750,000 Palestinians from what became the state of Israel, representing some 85% of the indigenous Palestinian population. 1967, Israel forced around 300,000 people (around half of them already refugees from 1948) from their homeland. Today, refugees and their descendants number, at a conservative estimate, around five million people. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that “forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.”  Under Article 147 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV, “unlawful deportation or transfer … of a protected person” constitutes a grave breach of the Convention.\n\n\n\nFor six decades Israel has refused Palestinian refugees their Right of Return; UN General Assembly Resolution 194 states that Palestinian “refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.” This resolution has been reaffirmed many times over by UNGA. Opponents of Palestinian rights claim 194 is irrelevant as UNGA resolutions are non-binding, however Israel’s accession to the UN was predicated upon its acceptance. Furthermore, the resolution is merely an acknowledgement of the specific applicability of the right of return to Palestinian refugees which, according to the Cambridge Journal of International & Comparative Law can be found in eight branches of international law: inter-State nationality law, law of State succession, human rights law, humanitarian law, law of State responsibility, refugee law, UN law, and natural/customary law.\n\n\n\n**The Siege of Gaza**\n\n\n\nSince 2007, the 1.8 million people in the Gaza Strip have existed under a regime of land, sea and air closure, known as the Siege, or Blockade, of Gaza. This siege has kept Gaza on the brink of a humanitarian disaster for the past seven years, a policy described by an Israeli official as being to “put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.” There is broad consensus amongst human rights organisations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Committee of the Red Cross as well as UN offices such as the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that this siege is illegal. UNOCHA called it “collective punishment, a violation of international humanitarian law,” while outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, has stated that it “is illegal and should be lifted.”"", 'No, I\'m replying to you.

They would rather whip out their phones and record instead of helping out that poor robot.', ""I've heard of a couple cases where an autonomous vehicle has hit the side of a semi truck's white box trailer without noticing it, in broad daylight, because there wasn't enough contrast against the sky. The first was when the truck was driving across the road and the car hit it at full speed, and the occupant was killed because the trailer was just above hood height. The second was when the semi truck was laying across the road on its side, and the car braked hard within a very short distance of it but hardly slowed, and nobody was seriously injured. \n\nThe odd part is that, even when the second crash was a year or two after the first, they still weren't able to properly correct it. It seems to indicate that either these problems are going to take a really long time to solve, or we might just end up with autonomous systems that occasionally make catastrophic errors that get people killed. Autonomous vehicles also don't have as much experience to show how they'll react to the poor weather conditions that make it hard for humans to see, like night driving in the rain/fog, because the driver would likely just take over. There might be extra aids for automous vehicles in the future, like radar reflectors or higher contrast markings on other vehicles and road features to give more reliable feedback to autonomous vehicles."", 'Autonomous Driving advocates are making the exact same argument as you do. You just refuse to see humans as failing systems incapable of making valid decisions. We see it time and time again in traffic. In fact, there was probably at least one person who died from a crash caused by a human driver while I wrote this comment. In the US alone the death rate from human-driven cars is about 4 per hour.\n\n> But that 1% of \'edge case\' which can\'t be solved by the machine is equivalent to letting human drivers in cars/situations where they are impossible to correctly react.\n\nExactly. So is that better or worse than the proven track-record of human drivers?\n\nI personally don\'t have any skin is this game because I\'d rather see the car system substantially reduced and replaced by public transit. I just think that ""all else being equal"", there are a lot of things that the self-driving software does better than humans. I think that in the future there will be a middle ground where cars have to use computer-aided driving systems to be allowed on the roads. If these systems are automatic or just act as emergency controls will be interesting to see.', 'If that 1% is is a better crash rate than human drivers then it becomes unethical to not switch', '> autonomous vehicle has hit the side of a semi truck\'s white box trailer\n\nI don\'t recall hearing it being a box truck ... I thought they were flatbed trailer\'s with the sun glare or road curvature something ... which made it hard to partition out, but, regardless.  This is a mechanical detection issue, in this case it was Tesla, not an algorithmic/probability decision making issue so personally I don\'t worry about these in the long term. \n\nIt was notorious at the time because I believe they were the first  ""self-driving"" mode related fatalities ... Tesla has dis-informational naming schemes for their (semi)autonomous modes I don\'t keep track of.\n\nIt\'s hard for engineers to separate what is a detection issue vs what is a decision issue.  As a result it takes a long time to build a convincingly competent detection hardware platform, to combine with an demonstrably reliable decision making process.\n\nDifferent vendor\'s have different success rates.  Tesla is not the top three, but, definitely top five.  Which is why they keep delaying on offering their ""true autonomous mode"" feature.\n\n\nSmartEye is probably the leader currently.', 'The problem in most of these cases isn\'t that the vehicle isn\'t ""seeing"" the object but rather the object is seen and classified incorrectly.\n\nFor instance... you have a front facing radar that sends and received signals, calculating distance based on the time those signals return and you can then string those together to determine distance changes while moving down the road. This is well understood technology that\'s been refined and in use for nearly 100 years now.\n\nNow, to get a clear picture in front of a car, you need to see just above the road surface in front of the vehicle, but also extend a bit upwards as well so you aren\'t just sending radar signals under vehicles in front of you. This radar is likely housed in the front bumper area since that\'s the only place with enough room. Now your sensor is angled upwards slightly to cover the road surface and up in front of the vehicle. You can now detect not only the road, but vehicles in front of the car. However, you also have overhead signage, bridges, etc. above the vehicle. And as you\'re driving down the road, the angle to those signs and bridges at various points are also going to be similar to large vehicles in front of the car.\n\nSo you now have false positive radar returns you need to filter out. So for example let\'s take that semi across the road, you are driving down a highway at 70mph, and the radar signal has been all clear but gets a sudden return at a high angle and the distance is closing, do you accept the signal or ignore it as a false positive? This is very likely to be an overhead sign you safely pass well under, or an overpass/bridge you\'re going to drive under. Or is it an object in the path you need to stop/brake for?\n\nIt could be a semi truck parked across the road where radar signals at car level are traveling through the trailer gap underneath and the radar return is from the side of the trailer itself. But which is more likely? How often is a semi stopped across a highway versus overhead signs or driving under bridges.\n\nThis is then where you get emphasis on alternate options like LIDAR, which effectively can paint a 3d image of points instead of simpler returns like radar. Effectively being more precise, but still unable to understand what it\'s actually seeing.\n\nOr we get into the realm of vision-based identification instead. This isn\'t particularly new technology either, but it requires a lot of processing power to run in real time and the algorithms for optimizing this are making massive improvements every year currently.\n\nYou might assume combining the two is the best option, sensor fusion helps you fill in gaps that individual sensors have. But now you have a dilemma of what to do if the results from the sensors and vision disagree with each other. Which do you trust more? The radar return may be less data overall, but is a better understood technology. The cameras however can literally see what the object is, or not, because it\'s still a technology in it\'s infancy that is changing daily.\n\nSo which result do you trust if they\'re giving you opposite signals? Whichever results in the safest reaction obviously right? Slamming on the brakes to avoid a semi trailer is good. Slamming on the brakes in the middle of a highway because you\'re driving under a bridge is extremely bad and can result in vehicles behind you hitting you, causing accidents, etc.\n\nThink about all those CAPTCHA responses you provide on a near daily basis using websites, signing up for accounts, etc. Those are all helping to train a neural net how to distinguish between different types of objects from a still video frame.\n\nFunctionally your brain only has the camera input (or rather two, but both facing forwards with just slightly different angles). There are no other radar or lidar sensors to help you drive. Theoretically a well trained neural network can drive just as good as a human as long as it\'s processing can be run in real time while moving. The advantage of vision-based driving like this is also that once it is trained to identify and make decisions based on that data, it can react similarly to a human would, without needing specialized infrastructure. It should work similarly in both a dense urban area and rural regions as long as it is trained on various objects it needs to identify.\n\nThis got kind of long, but I hope I explained the difficulty of coding something that seems simple to us on the surface. But only because we as humans do it every day and have already been taught and trained for how to respond day in and day out.', 'Not sure what I wrote to cause you to leap to the conclusion I ""refuse to see humans as failing systems"" ... I thought I was rather clear that humans are fallible and incredibly often.\n\nI was trying to comment on the notion that we don\'t value the human decision making system because it is fallible, nor even because we try to pretend it is better than it is which we do to no end.  We value it is because it is human.\n\nThe machine system will have ""unexpected circumstances"" resulting in the wrong decision.  Always.  Mostly by accident, but occasionally through malice.\n\nHumans, I was trying to say, don\'t come pre-configured with a built in inability to make a correct decision.  In the cases of car-crash, humans get distracted/etc and make the wrong decision - in this respect machines are much preferred; they don\'t get distracted.  But not from a lack of expectation they would make the correct decision (yes, some still do; human\'s are not uniformly competent, another advantage of mechanical reproduction [for any arbitrary level of competence]).\n\nAs long that is, that the circumstances of the situation are ""within known parameters"".\n\nIf a machine encounters that ""not designed for"" context, it will fail 99% of the time.  However humans have a much higher success rate.  This is proven by the nature of us living in ""the real world"" and thriving.\n\nThe comment I was criticizing conflates all of human behavior into the single domain in which the machine is near-perfect and ignores the context in which the human is better.\n\nI totally agree those situations are rare.  Almost one could say ""by design"" ... unusual circumstances are just that.  For instance in how heavily engineered roadways are.\n\nI look forward to not driving my car, perhaps more than most ... but I also don\'t feel I need to ignore the reasons why humans are still a superior sentience just for the sake of having it sooner - and less reliable.\n\nIn the long run my argument isn\'t to stop automation ... my argument is to try and realize that ""autonomous"" is not nearly ""intelligence"", and that only intelligence can make appropriate decisions in (some?few?many?) cases.\n\n\nThis isn\'t a new concept -- it\'s exactly why the notion of ""human level AI"" arises.  It\'s the current machine learning based systems which are exalted above their ability.\n\nTesla itself, for instance as one example, understands this ... their CEO twittering that ""fully autonomous will probably require human level AI"".', ""The thing you wrote was that we expect humans to make valid decisions, which I disagree with. Since human drivers fail to decide on such simple tasks as the correct speed and using the turn signals. Human drivers also drive off cliffs and into wet concrete. I don't expect humans to make valid decisions. \n\nI see know what you are trying to say and I agree that intelligent AI that can handle previously unseen situations has a long way to go. I think it would be possible for car AI to learn to detect more kinds of situations and  either have strategies for them or ask a human how to solve it. At the moment the main problem for a robot AI is that the systems that we have developed to aid drivers are all targeted at human drivers, and even for a human a lot of it must be trained or we actually expect the humans to make invalid and even dangerous decisions so we add more safety features. It's an established system based om human behavior (yet still fails pretty often). Maybe we will find ways to aid robot AIs as well (and hopefully it won't mean beacons on every pedestrian)?"", ""> and into wet concrete\n\nunintentional irony?  lol.\n\nSorry to keep going back to this ... I don't expect humans to make valid decisions *all the time*, which it sounds like you are implying I am saying.\n\nI am saying that a Human intelligence *has the expectation* of making a valid decision.  Just as a machine has an expectation of making invalid decisions in situations.\n\nWhether we shouldn't trust a machine incapable of making reliable choices in 100% of situations is a personal choice.  We do this with humans, and depending on what the unknowns are, I probably would also.\n\nI just don't think we really understand the unknowns well enough.""]"

I honestly hate this argument, let people work on what they find fulfilling instead of getting angry that they're not working on solving the problems you find meaningful. \n\nHell you could even make the argument that this is life saving work, getting self driving cars on the road even a day sooner will absolutely save lives when 3,700 people die every single day from road accidents. Getting sdc on the road needs to be economical before we are going to see it go widespread and figuring out how to get them recharged without having to station tens of thousands of people across the nation just sitting there waiting to plug something in is a pretty big deal in that equation.  You have no idea what these engineers would be paid to do if Tesla wasn't paying them for this, could be working on some automated box opener for their assembly line or some new trunk latch on their next model, maybe just maybe they wanted to work on this and thought it was a fulfilling and interesting way to spend their time."", 'Yes… it says:\n\n“Home can be verb, referring to ""finding one\'s way to a destination""\n\n“Hone in is also acceptable but far less common, and comes from the meaning of ""hone"" referring to sharpening or making more acute.”\n\nIn this case we are litearally talking about something finding its way to a destination. “Hone in” also being acceptable is referring to when they’re used metaphorically. IE home/hone in on the correct answer. In that case you could be “finding your way to the correct answer” (home in) or “sharpening and making your answer more acute/correct” (hone in.)\n\nBut that is not what the phrasing does here and hone in would not be appropriate. We are speaking literally. For example if we were discussing a homing missile we would say it homes in on its target, it does not hone in on its target.\n\nWords have meaning. I am not a prescriptivist by any means. However it is important to understand the distinction between using an idiom literally and figuratively. These idioms are only interchangeable when being used figuratively.\n\nFurther: if we were discussing sharpening a blade we would talk about honing not homing. Using homing would be incorrect.\n\n“Par for the course” and “predictable” have more or less the same meaning but if I were asking you literally about a golf course I wouldn’t say “how predictable is this course?”\n\nA huge part of language is understanding CONTEXT and that it is indeed not a passive collection of rules. You’re the one treating it like it is. “Article says both are fine” is passively applying a “rule.”  Read the article and understand the context and the context of the conversation being had and one of the phrases is clearly more applicable than the other (I’d go so far as to say “hone in” doesn’t make any sense in this context.”', "">We should probably work out who gets in trouble when one of those self driving cars kills someone first.

Or do you just work a typical job while being angry at others for not working on saving the world and consider that your contribution? Who are you to tell people working on something they may enjoy that they are wasting their time and need to go with on what you feel is most impactful. Everyone could be doing more to help humanity regardless of background, go build houses for habitat for humanity, go hand out food at a food bank, volunteer at a soup kitchen.

From this if you assume you are not accelerating you can estimate your pitch and roll, or if you have gyros (or more accelerometers displaced by some distance) to measure your pitch and roll rates you could pull out the acceleration. To get velocity you have to integrate the acceleration, which is very noisy except over the short term. In practice this is not done much over the long term (seconds) because it rapidly drifts without bound. They do it to arm munitions and rockets etc but those are big pronounced accelerations. In short, this could work, but it’s just not a very good or reliable approach here IMO. Lots of the baros on the market can register pressure altitude changes on the order of a foot (0.3m) or so, there is noise when the AC kicks on or exterior doors open or close, etc, but overall it would work well here.\n\nEdit to add: once the initial acceleration has stopped and the device is climbing with the escalator (perhaps 100ms or so?) there is no more acceleration to measure, so you can’t tell how fast you are moving, or if you’re moving at all.

It broke a lot of grippers fingers. It nearly pulled the conveyor legs out of the concrete.

Is it not something controlled by software and it's just called smart for some other reason?"", 'It\'s a paranoid question perhaps, but I\'m a paranoid guy so I understand lol.\n\nSo it is indeed a smart plug controlled by software. You\'re thinking of your typical smart plug that requires a third party app, that could of course grab whatever data and send back to the homeland or HQ. That being said, I\'m genuinely not sure what information a smart plug would send back to the company other than ""okay he turns the smart plug on sometimes. now he turns it off sometimes. okay it\'s back on"" and so on.\n\n[Apple HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/) is similar to Alexa and Google smart homes, except Apple HomeKit is strictly privacy focused first and foremost (at the cost of features compared to the other two).\n\nAdditionally, there are HomeKit-only devices (cameras, smart plugs, sensors, etc) meaning that they can be added straight in the Apple Home app without any third party app necessary (though it\'s still an option if you don\'t use Apple Home) so you can bypass the third party app altogether. These are the devices I now buy, those that can be set up and ran without a third party app. However, despite being able to snoop much much less, they can still allow connections to manufacturer-approved services in order to run if need be. Nothing nefarious, but I get it, what are ""manufacturer-approved services."" Which means to my next point.\n\nI also have some eero routers which are HomeKit-compatible. This means that any HomeKit devices, I can set to ""restrict to home"" which means that devices can ***only*** connect to my home hub, which can only be accessed via my iOS devices logged in my iCloud account. Anything that does not connect to this hub (so anything outside of my HomeKit devices and iOS devices) ***cannot*** access any information at all whatsoever, not even Apple themselves.\n\nThough despite what I was talking about allowing connections to manufacturer-approved services if you don\'t have a HomeKit-compatible router, that doesn\'t change the fact that ***no company*** including Apple and the camera company can see your video camera footage at all whatsoever. However, if you use a company with shit practices like Eufy that requires you to use setup through their app in order to use HomeKit (which is very contradictory), then they still have your footage go through their servers not because of your HomeKit footage, but because of the footage through their specific app. Essentially you\'d have footage going to both HomeKit (which Apple and Eufy wouldn\'t see) and Eufy (which Eufy can see).\n\nThis is truly scum practices, and to make it worse, if I try to restrict the connection to the home hub only (meaning I could only access the footage via HomeKit, but you can\'t see footage in the Eufy app unless on my wifi network meaning THEY can\'t see anything outside of your network), they essentially wreck the connection on purpose and render your camera useless. That\'s why it\'s important to look into cameras that are ***HomeKit-only*** so they can work without a third party app, and of course double up on smart plugs for extra safety. I relocated my Eufy camera to the garage for that reason lol, any footage they wanna see they can get of my car or empty garage.\n\nBut at the end of the day, all smart plugs do is turn on and turn off, remotely. Putting the privacy of Apple HomeKit aside, smart plugs don\'t know what they\'re plugged into, and any information that they could even gather would be so unimportant that I don\'t really think it\'s that big a deal for smart plugs specifically as opposed to cameras (but if you have the option, restrict them regardless). If you had a camera and a smart plug made both by the same company then sure I guess it would make sense in a paranoid mindset ""what if they know I\'m using it to connect my camera to, what if they purposely turn on the smart plug to spy on me,"" which is still ***extremely*** unlikely but not impossible. But Eufy for example, isn\'t going to have some collaboration with Wemo, Vocolinc or Meross smart plugs to somehow detect that said cameras are plugged into said smart plugs. And again this isn\'t even including Apple HomeKit, so this is just where even my own paranoia goes ""this is too paranoid"" lol.', ""I have a roborock which doesn't have that option, and it doesn't loudly bump into things, it slows right down and then gently taps obstacles to see if they're there and to calibrate it's position.\n\nThese robots use a SLAM/VSLAM system like on a self driving car, but because they're running off of relatively weak computer the algorithms used are fairly basic.\n\nThey rely on sensor fusion to calibrate and occasionally check their current position, their current position is probabilistic and over time the  uncertainty increases as small errors from the LIDAR sensor build up, when the uncertainty is above some threshold they bump into something to get a new anchor point to base their location off of.\n\nI'm 100% all LIDAR based ones do this, and pretty sure that even newer ones with both LIDAR and cameras do the same.\n\nNext time your run yours watch it closely and you'll see that it occasionally taps walls (and specifically corners/sharp edges), especially when moving into a new room or if you recently shifted furniture around."", ""I haven't ever looked into smart devices, so that was super informative, thank you! However, my comment wasn't related to the smart plug knowing what was plugged into it, it was related to this:\n\n> When I am home, the smart plug is off. When I am not home, the smart plug is on. This is automatic. No worries about wondering if the camera is really off via software, because nope the camera is literally physically disconnected from power!\n\nIt isn't physically disconnected from power is it? You aren't flipping a switch, there's just a software decision in the smart plug for on or off, right? So if the smart plug was bugged or defective or compromised, your camera could be powered when you think it isn't. Whether anyone knows what the smart plug is attached to or not was unrelated. Purely related to still relying on software to determine whether there's power, not a physical switch.\n\neta: really do appreciate all the information though. it's a tech space I haven't investigated at all, but it's interesting."", ""This, exactly this.\n\nThere are a lot of people who trust that nothing bad could ever come from following the instructions and they don't realize how easy it is to set up a bot to scan the internet for things that will find all the webcams.""]"

Turns certain lights off (wirelessly via radio waves to the other arduino) \n\n2. Turns certain lights on \n\n3. Tases the user \n\n4.
