"[""How are we to know that they are sentient? If they are not, this is clearly voter fraud. If they are sentient, however, we could argue that they shouldn't be allowed to vote because they aren't people and only people are allowed to vote. I doubt that humans would be particularly accepting of robots allowed to vote and the fact that their opinion is judged to be superior to that of anybody else's.\n\nTo the point of morality, I believe in Moral Nihilism - nothing is inherently good or bad.""]"
