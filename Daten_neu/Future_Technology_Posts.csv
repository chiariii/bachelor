"The Technology RevolutionMake no mistake, we are at the beginning of a technology revolution. It is happening in the background  and happening quicker than the population realise.

The way we live our lives will change unimaginably in the near future. How we interact with devices, how we consume information, how we are entertained. Brick and mortar retail stores will disappear to be replaced by showrooms. Online orders will arrive nearly instantaneously. Our relationship with technology will become even more personal and integrated  than we can possibly imagine at this point in time. The world will become smaller as it will be even more connected. We will live to see emerging technologies that are unfathomable at this moment.

There will be challenges. Soon, the words ""job"" and ""security"" will very rarely be mentioned in the same sentence. Huge proportions of the workforce are standing by, oblivious to the fact that there are forces moving in the background which will in the near future render their jobs obsolete. At the time it will seem to these unfortunate individuals like this has happened overnight. That is not the case. This is happening now. Most people just don't know.

With organisations needing less people to drive higher revenues than ever before, we will see them grow more powerful than entire economies.

In this revolution there will be huge opportunities for those brave enough to acknowledge the challenge, invest in themselves and adapt.

Businesses and entire industries will become redundant. Retail stores of the present will become a thing of the past. New billion and thrillion dollar enterprises will pop up in record time. There will be thrillionaires. New jobs will emerge. 

Of course this all seems very dramatic but if we delve into the core facts, it will seem more like science than science fiction.

Exponential Growth

Linear growth is +1 progression, where 1 becomes 2 which becomes 3 which becomes 4 and so on. 

In understanding exponential growth, let's look no further than Moore's law. As far back as 1965, George Moore, the founder of Intel noticed that over the previous decade, the number of integrated circuits on a transistor had been doubling every 12 months. This trend has been going on for a decade and Moore predicted it would continue for another 1 to 2 years at that rate. The reality is that rate of growth has continued to this day.

Let's put this exponential growth into perspective. If i take 30 linear steps I will make it from my apartment door entrance to the convenience store across the road. If i take 30 exponential steps, where will i be? The answer to that is on the moon!

Have a think about the shear scale of that fact. Now relate that thinking to the fact that this is the rate that technology has grown and is continuing to grow. This progression is why the smartphone in your pocket is a thousand times faster and a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970's.

The Disruptor

Once a product or service transitions from the physical to the digital, it becomes exponentially empowered. The digitalisation effectively creates a new market which disrupts the existing status quo. In an exponential era, there are two options for businesses, either disrupt or be disrupted.

You can think of established industries as the highest layer of tree's in a forest. They have the monopoly so move with incremental linear improvements which are driven by a desire to make gains over it's competitors. Ultimately they are happy to maintain their current status in the forest.

If you look far below this top layer, you will find smaller tree's who are insignificant in the context of the forest. These are the guys who have a vision and driven by passion will work their asses off to pursue that moment, that goal, that mission which will define their lives.

The vast majority of the smaller tree's will be starved of sunlight and wither away. However once in a while, one of these smaller tree's will burst through and out into the open sky. The tree's which were on top are now suddenly being starved of the sun. 

The previous kings of the forest have been disrupted. They go into survival mode. In this new world created by the disruptor, they need to innovate and innovate quickly to ensure their survival. Some will have the leadership and power to get themselves back on top. Other big tree's will fall. 

Up to 2007 Nokia were the dominant force in the smartphone market. The introduction of the iPhone seen Apple burst through the canopy forcing all other companies to make a smart phone or fall. To their credit Samsung got back on top. Nokia never did.

In the 70's the first digital camera was created inside Kodak. The image itself was underwhelming at 0.01 megapixels and the executives just couldn't see any potential in the technology with the following rationale:

1. Why would anyone want their images to be stored on a digital device? People wanted something to hold physically was the underlying assumption.
2. They calculated the technology for quality images was still 20 - 30 years away. That was linear thinking.

In the time since that decision, Kodak were disrupted by the digital camera industry. Gone are the days when a person would bring their photographic film into a Kodak shop to get all of their photo's processed.

Years after that the digital camera industry was in turn disrupted by  the smartphone.

There are so many examples happening all around us.

The taxi industry is being disrupted by Uber. 

The hotel industry by AirBnb. 

Tesla, the first successful car start up since Chrysler 90 years ago, is bringing electrical cars mainstream. 

Google, Telsa and Uber through self driving technology will forever change the way we interact with cars. One day we won't own or drive cars. Lives on the road will be spared. Self driving cars will pick us up and drive us to our destination. Think of Uber without the driver.

Commerce

eCommerce is growing 5 times faster than retail as a whole but the scary thing is that this is only the beginning. As our lives become ever more integrated with technology, it will continue to grow and grow exponentially faster than it's current rate.

We can order just about anything we want online but have you ever asked yourself why most of us don't order everything online? Why not groceries? Other household goods?

The fundamental problem is that for certain products, we need or want them instantaneously. A 3 day or more delivery process just doesn't cut it. It isn't much use if you need a key ingredient for that home cooked dish you are making for your partner tonight. Therein i believe that when deliveries are revolutionised, retail stores as we know them will begin to become a memory of the past.

In December 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced that in the next 5 years, drones will be delivering packages for Amazon. This will enable his goal of half hour deliveries and in doing so put Amazon in a position to unseat Walmart at the top of the food market. It will effectively turn Amazon into an everything store and the most successful store in history.

Drone deliveries, i believe, are the key. The technology is not mature enough yet but if Amazon nail this first, they will move to becoming bigger and more powerful than is conceivable.
 
The overnight successes

We have mentioned some of the biggest companies out there in Apple and Amazon but the fact is that in the new emerging economy, vast capital will not always be necessary.

Historically an ambitious business start up meant massive commitments financially. Revenues would grow in proportion to the cost of running the business. More revenue equals more infrastructure, more employee's, more office space, more overhead. Growth at scale.

That era is a thing of the past. Entrepreneurs no longer need huge capital to pursue game changing idea's. Snapchat is the biggest example of this new era with a market valuation of $15 billion, yet it only has 330 employees. 

Just a few years ago, a startup IT based business had some significant challenges in setting up a robust network infrastructure. As upgrading network infrastructure is grossly expensive, the start up needed to second guess the scale of infrastructure they required over a period of a few years. They then bought it all at a significant cost and spent weeks installing. All this before they really knew what they needed.

Cloud computing services like Amazons Web Services and Windows Azure now allows a would be entrepreneur to set up their network infrastructure in a matter of minutes and charges in proportion to usage. Need more storage, more RAM, more band-with? No problem. Your cost will be proportionate to what your system uses. 

Through our smartphones, the average individual now has access to the same of information as the president of the united states 18 years ago. If there is something we need to know, the only challenge is know how to find it. There is an infinite amount of information at our finger tips.

The startup entrepreneur needs design, copyright, programming skills to get their project going. Look no further than freelancer.com. A disruptor in the design space is 99 designs. You post your project and budget. Designers from around the world will be pitted against each other to win your business at a fraction of the traditional costs.  

The fact is that advances in technology have put a mammoth amount of power in the hands of any would be entrepreneur empowering more people than at any  time in human history. The power is with normal people, more so than at any point is history, to innovate and build on emerging technologies to disrupt and invent the next billion dollar industry.

Technologies that will disrupt

Artificial Intelligence will change our expectations of interactions with machines. They will understand what we need and want. If they are not pre-programmed to get you what you want, they will have the capacity to figure it out.

The interfaces of the future will not be through PC, laptop's, smartphones or smart TV's. You will see these technologies start to die in as soon as 5 years and have all but disappeared in 15 years, 20 years at the most. We will interact through voice with hardware and Augmented Reality for everything else.

3D printing is advancing at a pace that few understand. That technology will soon have the ability to print anything, from cars to furniture to anything else you want. Made to order and personalised as you want.

Robotics is the fastest growing industry in the world and poised to become the largest in the next decade according to a report by the Littler Workplace Policy. Manual labor is already being replaced by artificially intelligent robotics. These robots work 24/7 and don't require holidays, salaries or any of the other complications that come with humans. The only investments is up front and maintenance. The car industry has seen it's manufacturing lines becoming ever more dominated by machines. Sit back and watch this space grow.

The ""Internet of Things"" will mean that every item we could possibly imagine will be connected. My fridge notices I'm running low on beer so sends so orders a refill. My oven will know when my roast chicken is done so automatically switch off.  We will be connected through everything we own, not just our smartphones.

Biology and technology will merge. There are mood altering devices coming into the market which will either calm you down like meditation or give you a shot of energy like an espresso. Controlled on your smart phone, these devices use neurosignalling to stimulate pathways in your brain.  The execution will improve but the concept alone is mind boggling!

The rapid growth in each of these technologies is going to drive the lives and economies to the future.

Scratching the surface

The future is uncertain but the future is most definitely exciting. We are about to witness an era of change unheralded in human history.

It is scary and it is exciting. Tree's will burst through canopies. Billion dollar industries will crumble. Trillion dollar industries will burst through the forest and reach for the sky. The relationship between people and machines will change forever.

The future will belong to those who thing big, think at scale and are bold enough to pursue their ambitions. Opportunity's are there so get on board and enjoy the ride.

Huge proportions of the workforce are standing by, oblivious to the fact that there are forces moving in the background which will in the near future render their jobs obsolete. At the time it will seem to these unfortunate individuals like this has happened overnight. That is not the case. This is happening now. Most people just don't know.

With organisations needing less people to drive higher revenues than ever before, we will see them grow more powerful than entire economies.

In this revolution there will be huge opportunities for those brave enough to acknowledge the challenge, invest in themselves and adapt.

Businesses and entire industries will become redundant. Retail stores of the present will become a thing of the past. New billion and thrillion dollar enterprises will pop up in record time. There will be thrillionaires. New jobs will emerge. 

Of course this all seems very dramatic but if we delve into the core facts, it will seem more like science than science fiction.

Exponential Growth

Linear growth is +1 progression, where 1 becomes 2 which becomes 3 which becomes 4 and so on. 

In understanding exponential growth, let's look no further than Moore's law. As far back as 1965, George Moore, the founder of Intel noticed that over the previous decade, the number of integrated circuits on a transistor had been doubling every 12 months. This trend has been going on for a decade and Moore predicted it would continue for another 1 to 2 years at that rate. The reality is that rate of growth has continued to this day.

Let's put this exponential growth into perspective. If i take 30 linear steps I will make it from my apartment door entrance to the convenience store across the road. If i take 30 exponential steps, where will i be? The answer to that is on the moon!

Have a think about the shear scale of that fact. Now relate that thinking to the fact that this is the rate that technology has grown and is continuing to grow. This progression is why the smartphone in your pocket is a thousand times faster and a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970's.

The Disruptor

Once a product or service transitions from the physical to the digital, it becomes exponentially empowered. The digitalisation effectively creates a new market which disrupts the existing status quo. In an exponential era, there are two options for businesses, either disrupt or be disrupted.

You can think of established industries as the highest layer of tree's in a forest. They have the monopoly so move with incremental linear improvements which are driven by a desire to make gains over it's competitors. Ultimately they are happy to maintain their current status in the forest.

If you look far below this top layer, you will find smaller tree's who are insignificant in the context of the forest. These are the guys who have a vision and driven by passion will work their asses off to pursue that moment, that goal, that mission which will define their lives.

The vast majority of the smaller tree's will be starved of sunlight and wither away. However once in a while, one of these smaller tree's will burst through and out into the open sky. The tree's which were on top are now suddenly being starved of the sun. 

The previous kings of the forest have been disrupted. They go into survival mode. In this new world created by the disruptor, they need to innovate and innovate quickly to ensure their survival. Some will have the leadership and power to get themselves back on top. Other big tree's will fall. 

Up to 2007 Nokia were the dominant force in the smartphone market. The introduction of the iPhone seen Apple burst through the canopy forcing all other companies to make a smart phone or fall. To their credit Samsung got back on top. Nokia never did.

In the 70's the first digital camera was created inside Kodak. The image itself was underwhelming at 0.01 megapixels and the executives just couldn't see any potential in the technology with the following rationale:

1. Why would anyone want their images to be stored on a digital device? People wanted something to hold physically was the underlying assumption.
2. They calculated the technology for quality images was still 20 - 30 years away. That was linear thinking.

In the time since that decision, Kodak were disrupted by the digital camera industry. Gone are the days when a person would bring their photographic film into a Kodak shop to get all of their photo's processed.

Years after that the digital camera industry was in turn disrupted by  the smartphone.

There are so many examples happening all around us.

The taxi industry is being disrupted by Uber. 

The hotel industry by AirBnb. 

Tesla, the first successful car start up since Chrysler 90 years ago, is bringing electrical cars mainstream. 

Google, Telsa and Uber through self driving technology will forever change the way we interact with cars. One day we won't own or drive cars. Lives on the road will be spared. Self driving cars will pick us up and drive us to our destination. Think of Uber without the driver.

Commerce

eCommerce is growing 5 times faster than retail as a whole but the scary thing is that this is only the beginning. As our lives become ever more integrated with technology, it will continue to grow and grow exponentially faster than it's current rate.

We can order just about anything we want online but have you ever asked yourself why most of us don't order everything online? Why not groceries? Other household goods?

The fundamental problem is that for certain products, we need or want them instantaneously. A 3 day or more delivery process just doesn't cut it. It isn't much use if you need a key ingredient for that home cooked dish you are making for your partner tonight. Therein i believe that when deliveries are revolutionised, retail stores as we know them will begin to become a memory of the past.

In December 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced that in the next 5 years, drones will be delivering packages for Amazon. This will enable his goal of half hour deliveries and in doing so put Amazon in a position to unseat Walmart at the top of the food market. It will effectively turn Amazon into an everything store and the most successful store in history.

Drone deliveries, i believe, are the key. The technology is not mature enough yet but if Amazon nail this first, they will move to becoming bigger and more powerful than is conceivable.
 
The overnight successes

We have mentioned some of the biggest companies out there in Apple and Amazon but the fact is that in the new emerging economy, vast capital will not always be necessary.

Historically an ambitious business start up meant massive commitments financially. Revenues would grow in proportion to the cost of running the business. More revenue equals more infrastructure, more employee's, more office space, more overhead. Growth at scale.

That era is a thing of the past. Entrepreneurs no longer need huge capital to pursue game changing idea's. Snapchat is the biggest example of this new era with a market valuation of $15 billion, yet it only has 330 employees. 

Just a few years ago, a startup IT based business had some significant challenges in setting up a robust network infrastructure. As upgrading network infrastructure is grossly expensive, the start up needed to second guess the scale of infrastructure they required over a period of a few years. They then bought it all at a significant cost and spent weeks installing. All this before they really knew what they needed.

Cloud computing services like Amazons Web Services and Windows Azure now allows a would be entrepreneur to set up their network infrastructure in a matter of minutes and charges in proportion to usage. Need more storage, more RAM, more band-with? No problem. Your cost will be proportionate to what your system uses. 

Through our smartphones, the average individual now has access to the same of information as the president of the united states 18 years ago. If there is something we need to know, the only challenge is know how to find it. There is an infinite amount of information at our finger tips.

The startup entrepreneur needs design, copyright, programming skills to get their project going. Look no further than freelancer.com. A disruptor in the design space is 99 designs. You post your project and budget. Designers from around the world will be pitted against each other to win your business at a fraction of the traditional costs.  

The fact is that advances in technology have put a mammoth amount of power in the hands of any would be entrepreneur empowering more people than at any  time in human history. The power is with normal people, more so than at any point is history, to innovate and build on emerging technologies to disrupt and invent the next billion dollar industry.

Technologies that will disrupt

Artificial Intelligence will change our expectations of interactions with machines. They will understand what we need and want. If they are not pre-programmed to get you what you want, they will have the capacity to figure it out.

The interfaces of the future will not be through PC, laptop's, smartphones or smart TV's. You will see these technologies start to die in as soon as 5 years and have all but disappeared in 15 years, 20 years at the most. We will interact through voice with hardware and Augmented Reality for everything else.

3D printing is advancing at a pace that few understand. That technology will soon have the ability to print anything, from cars to furniture to anything else you want. Made to order and personalised as you want.

Robotics is the fastest growing industry in the world and poised to become the largest in the next decade according to a report by the Littler Workplace Policy. Manual labor is already being replaced by artificially intelligent robotics. These robots work 24/7 and don't require holidays, salaries or any of the other complications that come with humans. The only investments is up front and maintenance. The car industry has seen it's manufacturing lines becoming ever more dominated by machines. Sit back and watch this space grow.

The ""Internet of Things"" will mean that every item we could possibly imagine will be connected. My fridge notices I'm running low on beer so sends so orders a refill. My oven will know when my roast chicken is done so automatically switch off.  We will be connected through everything we own, not just our smartphones.

Biology and technology will merge. There are mood altering devices coming into the market which will either calm you down like meditation or give you a shot of energy like an espresso. Controlled on your smart phone, these devices use neurosignalling to stimulate pathways in your brain.  The execution will improve but the concept alone is mind boggling!

The rapid growth in each of these technologies is going to drive the lives and economies to the future.

Scratching the surface

The future is uncertain but the future is most definitely exciting. We are about to witness an era of change unheralded in human history.

It is scary and it is exciting. Tree's will burst through canopies. Billion dollar industries will crumble. Trillion dollar industries will burst through the forest and reach for the sky. The relationship between people and machines will change forever.

The future will belong to those who thing big, think at scale and are bold enough to pursue their ambitions. Opportunity's are there so get on board and enjoy the ride.
