"['True, although there are alternative brands that perform with similar or slightly inferior results at the moment. Is double the cost for a 10 percent increase in performance deemed acceptable? Only the individual user can determine this. Note that this post is only true right now in time. As the industry is moving at an incredible pace at the moment, what I say right now may not be true in 12 months. \nStay tuned.']"
"[""Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:\nI learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,\nand 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at\nsomeone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics)\n\nI do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.\n\nHave a nice day!""]"
"[""Only the 9xx models offer 100% coverage.  If you have a 650 like I do you must embrace the chaos theory and be okay with it skipping rooms.  If you run it often enough it will cover everything.\n\nWhat you really want is the competitors product.  The Neato Botvac has a lidar scanner, a more powerful vac, and a D shape to fit into corners.  I bought one to cover the main floor and have found it to be the more competent robot.  Oh and it's so much cheaper than a 900 model.""]"
"[""Hello. \nIt all comes to Your budget. \nAt the same price scale you've got Irobot roomba 890. Which is quite good, judging by reviews.\nCurrently, I have roomba 980. My third one. Cost about $100 more but it totally worth it. Good cleaning performance, long charge, impressive mobility.\nActually, full list with the comparison you can find here http://tenrows.com/robot-vacuum/""]"
"[""I don't have either, but I am in the market for a robot vacuum. That said, I have read a LOT about them recently. The side brush seems to be a significant update for the Neato on carpeted floors but the side brush also seems to be worse than the Roomba side brush.\n\nSo take it how you will.\n\nI'm personally trying to order a Xaiomi.""]"
