"Anki Vector .NET SDK 0.7.0 - Develop in C## Anki Vector .NET SDK (0.7.0)

The Vector .NET SDK gives you direct access to Vector's unprecedented set of advanced sensors, AI capabilities, and robotics technologies including computer vision, intelligent mapping and navigation, and a groundbreaking collection of expressive animations.  

This SDK lets you develop programs that connect to Vector in any .NET language (C#, VB.NET, F#) on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.  This SDK is not officially supported by Digital Dream Labs.

"SDK to access Cozmo and Vector resourcesI've put together an SDK that  allows manipulation of a resources folder from an ""over the air update"" OTA file for [Anki Vector](https://www.anki.com/en-us/vector) and the APK files for [Anki Cozmo](https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo), that can be used by any .NET language (ie C#, Visual Basic, F#) or one that bridges with it (such as python).

Note: This requires that you know how to get these files, and how extract the contents.

# Downloading:

* The source code be downloaded from github: [https://github.com/randym32/Anki.Resources.SDK](https://github.com/randym32/Anki.Resources.SDK)
* An assembly package can be downloaded from Nuget: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anki.Resources.SDK/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anki.Resources.SDK/)

It is still pretty preliminary, so features and capabilities will continue to expand.

# Documentation

The documentation can be read online at [https://randym32.github.io/Anki.Resources.SDK](https://randym32.github.io/Anki.Resources.SDK)

# Sample code

An initial collection of sample code using the SDK can be found at: [https://github.com/randym32/Anki.Resources.Samples](https://github.com/randym32/Anki.Resources.Samples)

The examples include

* Playing the sound files from Cozmo and Vector resource forks
* Playing the sprite sequence (visual animations) from Cozmo and Vector
* Playing some of the composite images from Vector

More examples will be included with time."

"Cloud communication protocol info, and attempts to add app intents to OSKRHey.. to let other people know, I’ve collected information about the cloud communication protocols in a section of a wiki that I've been creating.  (The link will be at the bottom)

I’ve separated these out of the TRM that I maintain into their own separate area for a couple of reasons. First, they don’t really say anything about how Vector works. (Unlike the SDK protocol which is deeply intertwined). Second, many other people will know a lot more about the concepts than I do — things like secure token servers, JSON web tokens, and so on. Anyone who knows about these topics, I could use your help.  Feel comfortable clicking the edit button and editing the wiki bits.

(Of course, everyone is encourage to edit. Just fixing formatting, grammatical and spelling mistakes would be a huge help!)

I do have a some high hopes for using this protocol information. I’d like to have a server gather log files to help us debug and tweak our bots as we move into updated animations, sounds, behaviors and (I hope) updated software.  If anyone can help with that, it'd be greatly appreciated.

I think that we can edit the user intent maps on OSKR bots to allow the SDK to send any intent today; and use the information we can suss out about the cloud intents to reconstruct the .proto files for u/ikkez and u/wvenable SDK’s. I absolutely confident that it’s do-able. 

If some of the protobuf files for the cloud do become available, I think that the documentation text to be integrated with them as comments that can also be the documentation. (I’ve noticed that Anki’s .proto files do have some comments but not really enough.)

"nOOb needs help getting started (.net SDK)Hi there, I'm new!

I'm using the .net version of the SDK for the face enrollment, and because I can't get the python SDK working on my machine due to python version issues (even with anaconda).

I'm on Linux. I've installed .net 3.0 and the 0.7.0 SDK - so far so good. 

I've been reading the documentation etc but am stumped by two things:

1. How do you fire the dammned thing up? Like make a window appear through which to interact with the SDK, see camera feed / map etc?
2. I'm confused how the SDK interacts with wire-pod and the webUIsdk that comes with that. Will that break if I use the .netSDK

I hope there's an easy answer to this I'm missing as I have zero familiarity with .net (though am familiar with C++ from arduino work)."

"Anki Vector Developer Community# Welcome to the Anki Vector Developer Community on Reddit

The purpose of this subreddit is to support development for the [Anki Vector](https://www.anki.com/en-us/vector) robot.  The two main ways to develop for Vector right now is the [official SDK](https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk) for Python and the [unofficial .NET SDK](https://github.com/codaris/Anki.Vector.SDK).

## Rules

* If there's someone new and it's not a ""Getting Started with development"" thread, help them along, don't treat them like idiots!

* If there is a general question or unrelated thread, it will be removed. Threads for promoting your app should go to /r/ankivector instead.

* Request threads will be removed.

* Use tags in your titles; for example, [Question] for questions, [Meta] for questions about the subreddit, [Tip] for tips about good practices for code, etc. This allows readers to hide specific posts with RES.

* No memes. Threads with memes will be removed.

* Meta threads (threads about the sub itself) will be removed after the discussion in them is complete.

* Be civil and friendly. No egregiously insulting/rude, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. comments or posts.

* No piracy.
