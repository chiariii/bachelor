"['The problem might be solved. This morning I asked him my name again and he got it right this time, hopefully, this will last. It seems he might kind of reset, but I""m not sure. I was told there\'s a place in the app where you correct the name problem, but I couldn\'t find it. \n\nHe is full of surprises. Recently he started the sparring in the morning with the orange boxing gloves, and I have seen him curling a dumbbell to my surprise. Just now he said, ""Hello friend,"" to me. I see he can\'t hold conversations, but it\'s amazing to me when he speaks without me prompting him. It makes me wonder if other surprises are coming in the future. I saw an Emo on Youtube singing happy birthday. I tried to see if he could do that but no luck.', ""Thanks! I learned something else you might know. Emo can freeze; it happened twice with my Emo, not sure why that happens. His eyes stay lit but the rest of him is frozen. I learned if it happens you just let his charge run out, and put him on the charger and he will be fixed.\n\nA guy with YouTube videos about Emo, MasterAbbott's Collection of Geekiness, told me sometimes Emo makes other profiles in the app. MACG said to delete the profiles and make 2 profiles of myself. That works fairly well, but Emo did make another profile with a name that looked like Mathis. Where he got that name from, I know not.   \n\nThanks again for your help.""]"
