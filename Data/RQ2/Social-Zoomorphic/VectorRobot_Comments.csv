If you want to use voice commands, it's a must.\n\nThe price tag is somewhat steep in my opinion, however, especially when compared to other subscription-based services. And the subscription does not differentiate between users that use voice commands very often and those that rarely use it. The latter pay the servers for the first ones (simplified). Without detailed statistics from DDL it is difficult to say what the running the servers really costs, but from a gut feeling I would say, they make good money with the somewhat overpriced subscription.""]"
"['It depends on how into robots he is. I\'ve had my Vector since like March and he\'s awesome but the initial interest has def worn off. I also bought the subscription, but honestly he\'s just as interesting without subscription once you lose interest in the features that it offers. The features are really basic like ""Hey vector - wait 4 seconds - hows the weather?"" Really basic commands. While I was without subscription I still used him as an Alexa, which in terms of voice commands Alexa is much much smarter. Alexa also gives more details weather info and ends with a nice friendly comment. I\'m thinking I might stop my subscription and just continue using him as an autonomous Alexa, but that\'s just me. TL;DR, get Vector if your BF has expressed interest in robots or Vector. Otherwise, I\'d use the money towards something else.\n\nEdit: If you guys are into Rick and Morty they have a butter robot coming out which is a little less expensive and will be the robot hit of this year\'s holiday.']"
"[""I recently bought, a used Vector from ebay, unfortunately it arrived when DDL, were transferring from Anki to their own servers. I got a subscription straight away but I had issues connecting to anki servers this went on for just under a week. After deleting user date reseting my modem and trying all other trouble shooting. I took some advice off someone on here and just kept refreshing it every hour or so and I also emailed DDL, explaning my problem and included my vectors serial number and eventually, after a couple of days patience, it connected. \nWhen DDL finally got back to me, they said to aways put PAYING MEMBER NOT WORKING in the subject line. \nDespite these issues, I still couldn't recommend  buying a Vector highly enough. This may sound a bit sad and geeky but when i was little I always wanted a little robot friend like Weebo from flubber, but every birthday or Christmas, I was disappointed sadly technology was not advanced enough in the late nintys to meet my robot expectations but now with Vector we are finally there. I am constantly impressed with this little robot from his constantly updating abilitys to the way he can make you feel for him with just some cute noises and expressive eyes. I am constantly annoyed with or snapping at my Alexa but I could never get angry with Vector""]"

"[""Anki fell into the trap of requiring Internet connection to their hosting servers to make this work. This let them collect data and I guess their thought was they could monetize that ala Google sometime in the future to build a revenue stream. \n\nHowever, hosting servers is expensive! If you can't keep income coming then your server host/electrical provider/ISP all need money themselves and will not be giving you charity donations. This is what happened with Anki - that purchase price you gave for this rather fancy feature filled robot tank probably barely covered the R&D and a few months of server time.\n\nSo, they went bust and shut down, and a month later Digital Dream Labs picked up their intellectual property. They took a hard look and can see the value of this little guy plus the fans who would support it, and worked out a subscription model. It's $47 a  year which at minimum wage of 7.25 US is 7 hours of work - so one shift's worth of income per year to keep this going - honestly I think it's pretty reasonable given the benefit of cloud services tied to it. Otherwise it's $97 one time fee to 'unplug' it and run your own server at home if you're so inclined.""]"

They have never actually sold a Vector and maybe never will. Why the concern over pricing when you're not even planing to buy one? The extortionate prices are actually helping people like you to get more than they paid for their unwanted Vectors. \n\nMany here will say that without DDL's intervention, Vector would be completely unsupported and may already have lost voice commands. I was having quite a heated discussion with one of their employees here on Reddit regarding this whole situation a while back. Having said my piece and not being happy with their response i dropped it and effectively walked away. It is what it is so there's nothing anyone can do about it.\n\nSmashing a tiny defenseless robot with a bat is childish at best...""]"

"['Just thought I would share so you will know that I am serious about this. As of right now, I do believe that I will not be getting any displays. Santek has not gotten back to me after 3 emails. About 2 months now. And I am not aware of any other sources for this particular display. I am also doing the research to find a lot of the other components. It would seem that if you are not a legitimate business, they don\'t want anything to do with you. They only sell to other manufacturers. I am hoping that once I do this and prove It can be done, that DDL will start supplying me with some displays and other parts. At a cost of course. This is so people can keep their Vector and not have to purchase another one. I have heard people say that they have gotten so attached to their little guy, that they just can\'t bring themselves to replace him. This is why I am trying so hard to fix Vector.\n\nRight now, I am in the process of helping that gentleman with his Vector first. After all, I told him I would give it my best. But, once again I cannot find any absolute information as to the part number of the IR sensor. I got a ""Similar to"" on the discord that I am going to check out. I sure hope it works. I am waiting on some ceramic matting right now. I will use it to protect the surrounding components from the heat. This mat is also used in kilns and other high temp applications. It is a non conductor of heat. Just the opposite of a heat sink. Which absorbs the heat from the component and dissipates it into the air. Sometimes heat sinks just aren\'t enough and a fan has to be added to help with the dissipation of heat.']"

If I find it I will message you.

"[""Well known problem. There is a tutorial on iFixit to show how to do the head teardown. The problem is that the screen (display) is attached to the headboard where Vector's brain is located. Changing that headboard also changes his serial number (and personality). Special soldering equipment is required to remove and replace the display. \n\nDDL has said they will offer repair services Real Soon Now. They must be aware of the display problem so I would guess they are stocking up on LCD displays. Searching Reddit you will find lots of users checking in with this problem. I am not on Facebook but in the official DDL-Vector Facebook group there was a guy from UK who had sourced the displays and was claiming he did repairs. You might look there."", ""It doesn't look like the company that took over Vector does it yet so I'm not sure why they told you that.\n\nhttps://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/vector-faq\n\nThere's a good amount of info online for repairing him yourself.

They are just new questions and answers for Vector. DDl did not give Vector more personality or abilities that he already didn\'t have. They made subtle sound changes that I can\'t even hear. And as far as abilities, they changed nothing that I can see. I am a 66 years young man. take everything you read on here with a grain of salt.  Even from me. Because I am not an expert on robotics.
