"A drink after the fanfic[2069]

Setting: A dimly-lit bar or pub, the air filled with low-THC cannabis smoke to add a *noir* ambiance without the problem of cancer. The fading daylight is visible through the bar's French doors and intricate wrought-iron security gates. On the back wall is the famed Victorian-era painting of dogs playing poker; a few chinoiserie pots sit on a shelf beyond human reach. Faintly visible on the street is a wheeled mechanoid robot, amusing himself with a ball while waiting for his master to return. An older man, a harmonica and some Native American feathers around his neck and a fedora on his head, is reminiscing to the other patrons at the counter.

""Ah, the 2020s. Remember them? They were the Transformers fanfic of decades. UFOs, generational conflict, robots, drones, climate destruction, disease, famine, disease-fighting robots, ethnic tension, war, shapeshifting robots, an energy crisis, and an almost complete collapse of trust in the world's governments. Beer, please.""

The bartender looked at the old men.

""Okay. That'll be 500 cents.""

The harmonica man handed him a few bills and coins and began rambling on to no-one in particular. ""What we realized, when we staggered out the other side, was that we as a species needed to look backward to go forward. To embrace a more traditional way of life, smaller-scale. Small homes, small markets, tight-knit neighborhoods. To embrace the weird, the fantastic - to schedule around carnivals and celebration and make things less serious and less focused on squeezing every cent of profit out of each other. To embrace, or at least tolerate, old-age and natural death as necessary for human society to turn over and for old prejudices to gradually pass into the books of history - and what better way to do that than with a tragicomic jazz funeral? And to embrace both cultural diversity and integration, opening up the toy chest of thousands of years and hundreds of cultures' worth of human experience in order to play with and re-combine them in new ways."" 

He put the old French harp to his mouth and blew out a couple of notes, then moseying older to an upright piano. He pulled out a dead-tree book, its pages worn from years of abuse, and set it on the stand where sheet music should go. 

""To put it poetically, we had to go way back to old New Orleans. It was written in the 1870s by the great Lafcadio Hearn -- 'For a hundred years and more has New Orleans been drawing hither wandering souls from all the ends of the earth. The natives of India and of Japan have walked upon her pavements; Chinese and swarthy natives of Manila; children of the Antilles and of South America; subjects of the Sultan and sailors of the Ionian Sea have sought homes here. All civilized nations have sent wandering children hither. All cities of the North, East, and West have yielded up some restless souls to the far-off Southern city, whose spell is so mystic, so sweet, so universal.' Here we saw a place that, for its time, was relatively tolerant; where black voodoo kings and queens could live alongside immigrants from all over Europe and Asia, all bringing ancient traditions together from the Graeco-Roman aesthetic of Carnival to primitive African religion, and many of its racial and economic problems could be attributed to interference from 'the Americans.'""

""Do y'all want to hear some authentic New Orleans music tonight, or are you just feeling a bit grey and boring?"""

"Training Rooms*With the new year well underway; many of the new first years testing their collective might against others of their kin, battling it out in the combat classes of recent, there grew a need for the gymnasium to be re-opened. Some of those who lost in their fights may want to train for their returning bout; or the more pacifist in the nature may just want to sharpen their skills for their first true crack at the Grimm.*

*Still there was all of the weights, running machines, climbing walls and the training dummies scattered across the floors of the gymnasium. The fighting ring, definitely used and worn in in many a spar come to pass, had recently had a refurbishment to replace some broken parts, the various unexplained fist-shaped holes and elemental effects of dust cleared away from years past, ready for a new layer of general wear-and-tear from the new wave of students.*

*New this year, asides from the replaced equipment, was a new-and-improved dummy program, sequestered off into another room. Though expensive to manage, this dummy program uses some of the Atlesian's old mechanoid robot soldiers, armed with non-lethal blunt weapons and concussive ammo in their rifles. Programmed to seek out the user that initiated the machines with a manipulable difficulty range, they were able to simulate battle without the user having to cause harm to other humans.*

*Still, for many, this was a gym first and a place to settle with combat second. All could come and use the facilities, barebones as the majority of it might be.*"
"[Stories] Sacking of Breinigsville: A Rimworld Short Story[EDIT]: I don't want to self-advertise, but I can't figure out how to make this look nicer. If you want a (slightly) better format, you can read it here: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~benjamse/writings/rimworld_storytelling.txt

I


Once, I had two pawns named Kasumi and Gil. They lived in a colony called
Breinigsville. Breinigsville was the rare kind of colony where two people could
get away from the constant struggle for survival for awhile, and relax. It was a
large village, for a rimworld -- 15 people lived there altogether -- and most
things there were provided for them. There was never a shortage of food or nice
clothing for anyone, and any issues were rectified by paying one of the nearby
friendly tribes to send a caravan of goods to trade for the fine art that made
the colony famous.


Kasumi and Gil were soulmates. While they hadn't settled down and actually
gotten married yet, (after all, there are other things to worry about on the
Rim!) they were clearly and undoubtedly in love. They did everything together:
they went on walks, hewed art out of rocks in the same workshop, and they even
hunted together. Their schedules were synchronized, from the moment they woke up
in the morning to the moment they went to bed in their modest cabin. It was
separated by some distance from the block of houses that everyone else lived in;
they liked their privacy.


Kasumi was abrasive, and had ice water running through her veins instead of
blood. She was a crack shot with a sniper rifle, once downing a charging Thrumbo
with a headshot after it had injured or killed everyone else that tried to hunt
it. She was always the first one out to try to stop a bandit siege, picking off
the gunners of the giant mortar guns before they could even finish constructing
them. When not throwing herself headlong into situations that could only be
survived by a sniper of her caliber, she remained detached from most of the
others in the colony, except for Gil. She spent most of her days outside the
walls of the compound, hunting.

Gil, on the other hand, was a socialite. He was Breinigsville's main warden and
trader, which made him one of the more valuable members of the town. He was
friends with everyone, and spent much of his time training the others in how to
snatch a good deal or undercut the opposition without them noticing. Once, he
was able to save the colony after a brutal winter by selling one statuette for
an entire spring's worth of food; he then later bought back the same statuette
for half the cost. When in combat, he abhorred guns, preferring to get right up
close to the enemy with an enormous steel longsword.

They were perfect for each other, and despite Kasumi's reclusiveness, they were
both well-respected in the community. Most of the people who lived through the
tougher parts of the colony's history can recall tales of these two
singlehandedly saving it.

Breinigsville was the kind of place that could've probably survived without
their intervention, most of the time. There was a central compound where the
kitchens, storehouses, and artists worked, a set of individual houses where
everyone lived, a huge tract of farmland growing everything from rice to
healroot, and a massive geothermal generator and redundant power system
supporting it all. Surrounding all of this was a thick outer wall that had
repelled many bandit attacks before, and the only way to get to the town was
through a large bunker filled with auto-turrets.

These defenses had held out against many attacks in the 6 years since
Breinigsville had been founded. Even the massively powerful mechanoid robots
were repeatedly unable to breach its defenses. The only thing that had worried
the guard of the place had been the bandit sieges with their large, powerful
mortar guns.

Still, Breinigsville had always held against even the most determined assaults,
which is why when a 25-person bandit siege dropped in across the river, they
weren't really worried. Kasumi, as usual with her, immediately turned on the
matrix of auto-turrets and went out with her sniper rifle. Gil stayed behind
with the squad of defenders in the bunker.


II

Kasumi got within range of the bandits. They were haughtily building a perimeter
of sandbags and mortar guns, laughing and scheming about what they were going to
do with the riches looted from the famed vaults of Breinigsville, deep in the
mountain.

""Fuckers,"" she muttered to herself, laying down prone inside a nook in the
mountain wall. She extended the bipod on her sniper rifle and settled down to
wait. You always had to take out the mortar gunners, or else they'd shell the
defenses to the town as they attacked it.

She felt a tinge of uneasiness. There were a lot more bandits in this group than
usual. Breinigsville usually had about 7 or 8 competent troops to defend it, and
bandits usually attacked with about double that. With the thick defensive
perimeter the colonists fought behind, battles like this were usually a breeze.
They hadn't lost anyone for a year.

Yet, she was uncertain that she'd be able to kill them all this time. She
counted 6 gunners, and this time they also had snipers of their own. With the
right timing, and her silencer, she thought she might be able to take out 2 or 3
of them before they spotted her and returned fire.

Still, she wasn't about to withdraw. She was across the river from the colony,
which straddled one side of the steep banks. A huge mountain range stretched for
miles on either side of her, and she looked down across a vast plain towards the
valley where the bandits were set up. It was spring, so everything shined with a
scintillating green color. They'd have very little cover if they charged her, so
she'd probably be able to clap a few more of them before she needed to flee
across the bridge again. She had a long sprint to it, but she was confident that
she'd be able to make it if she timed it right.

She could see the colony engineers placing and activating more auto-turrets
outside of the bunker. It seemed like they'd realized how many of the bandits
there were, too.

She radioed in. ""Bre, do you copy?""

A staticky voice came through, which she recognized immediately as Gil's.

""Yeah, Kas, we're here. There's a lot of those shitheads out there, huh?""

""Yeah,"" Kas replied, ""and they have long-range, too.""

""Fuck."" He sounded worried. ""They're in the valley, so they won't be able to
fire on you if you run back now.""

""I can't do that, Gil. They have six mortars.""

He swore at that, again.

""Pull back. We can hide in the mountain, and fight them indoors where the
mortars can't hit us.""

""Gil,"" she said, snapping at him, ""we're outnumbered. The only way we can beat
these guys is with the auto-turrets, and you can't move them from the bunker in
time. Plus, I don't want the town to go up in flames while we cower in a cave. I
have to stay here.""

He sighed. ""Just... just be careful, alright? I can't go out there and help you
-- not with those snipers around.""

""I promise. This isn't any different than last year's siege.""

""I hope so,"" he replied. ""Out, for now."" The radio crackled, and then went
silent.

Her soulmate assuaged, for now, she turned her attention back to the bandit
camp. They wandered lazily around like they had all the time in the world,
building up sandbags around their big mortar guns. She looked for an opportunity
to clap one without anyone noticing, but they were all grouped in clumps of 3 or
4 as they constructed. There was one that looked like she was the leader,
ordering people around, but it was a pretty loose operation, overall; typical of
the pirate raids in this area of the rimworld. Some of them were run like
efficient militias, complete with actual army training and everything, but many
of them were just rabble with guns, under loose leadership.

She turned her scope up, slightly, and saw a streak of fire in the sky. She
lifted her head and saw a couple of drop pods barreling down, landing amongst
the mortars. The doors on each of them, primed with a small explosive, popped
off. Smoke from the landing obscured her view, and she went back to her scope to
try to see what the bandit home base had just dropped on them.

She saw a shadow of a figure through the thick smoke, and what looked like a
crate. As it began clearing, she saw that the crates held the shells for the
mortars. It looked like 200, maybe 300 shells, enough to bring a large chunk of
the mountain down on their heads if they let them fire them all.

She radioed in. One of the lead empaths -- diplomats who were not allowed to
harm anyone -- answered. When she told him the number of shells they had, she
could almost hear him blanch. He told her she had the go-ahead to fire.

Steadying herself, she looked through her scope again. She saw four of the
bandits clustered around one of the crates, having trouble opening it. One of
them fetched a crowbar, popped the lid off, and lifted one of the
coppery-looking shells in the air. Kas spotted a flaming symbol on the side of
the canister, indicative of a high-explosive round. Filled with chemfuel, they
would start a fire after they rained down on the town. The defenses wouldn't
stand a chance.

She held her breath and fired a round right into the shell the bandit was
holding. The shell exploding triggered its brethren in the crate, and the
shockwave tossed the rest of the attackers like rag dolls, slamming them into
the mountain walls and the mortar guns. The bandit that was holding the shell
was vaporized immediately, and his friends didn't fare much better. They
screamed in agony as the flaming chemfuel enveloped them, and one of them jumped
into the river and passed out from the pain. Later on, his catatonic body would
become food for the wolves.

Kas smiled. The fuckers deserved it.

One of the mortar guns melted in the inferno. A tree caught fire, and from there
the forest began to go up in flames. During the confusion, Kas managed to kill
two more of the bandits. She popped up and down, hiding behind a rock to avoid
the sights of the bandit snipers that had set up behind the sandbags. They
sweeped over the mountain passes, looking for any attackers as the rest of them
tried to put out the flames and apply some triage to their concussed friends.

She counted four gunners left. She popped out of cover, and aimed for one's
head.

In the five years she and Gil had been a members of Breinigsville, Kas had never
gotten injured. Not once. She had grown up as a member of an urbworld gang, so
she was no stranger to pain, or gunshot wounds, but as a colonist she was always
fairly removed from the action. The worst thing that had ever happened to her
was a 3-month stint with gut worms, which is why it was so surprising to her
when she was shot.

Initially, she didn't know what had happened. She was thrown back and hit her
head on the stone ceiling of the nook she was in. She sat there stunned for a
moment. Her vision was red. Then, the senses came back to her. She was dimly
aware of a throbbing, blisteringly hot pain coming from her left shoulder, and a
strong headache where she hit the back of her helmet on the cave ceiling. She
undid the strap to it and struggled to get it off; the dent was painfully
pressing in on the back of her head. Her short, brown hair glistened with slick
blood.

Another shot rang out, striking the entrance to the cave. Kas scrambled back
behind her rock, dragging her rifle with her. She had dropped it when she flew
back, but it looked to be in good shape. She radioed into the colony.

""Bre, Bre, come in. I've been clapped. Repeat, I've been clapped. I need help!""

Gil came on the com. ""Kas! Where are you hit? I'll send a party out right awa-""

She cut him off. ""Shoulder, Gil. I can still shoot. But I need someone to go out
and secure the other side of the mountain face. I can't get out of cover while
there's a sniper out there.""

She heard him speak unintelligibly to another one of the guards. ""Will they be
safe?""

""Yeah, just stay along the wall so he won't see you coming.""

Gil barked an order to one of the guards. ""They're on their way, just stay
tight. Out.""

Kas breathed in and held it. She couldn't do much while she was sitting there,
so she closed her eyes and focused on the pain. The bullet hadn't gone through
the back side of her armor vest, and was stopping much of the bleeding. Her
vision swam, and she did a small battle meditation that she learned in her time
as a convent child on her urbworld. Control the pain, they said. You can still
fight.

""Mi ne estas en doloro,"" she chanted, softly, in the ancient language of her
urbworld. I am not in pain.

It subsided, a little bit, and she bandaged the wound with her field medical
kit. She shifted to the side, and barely poked her scope around the edge of the
rock to see what was going on. It obscured her view of the bandit camp, but she
could see the smoke and ash rising from the burning forest. There was less
screaming, now, so presumably all of the bandits had gotten away from the
danger.

Through the scope, she scanned the mountain face. She could see two of the
colony's guards running around the edge of the mountain face, trying to stay out
of the sight of any of the snipers. They probably wouldn't be able to see them,
as the snipers were in a valley, but she was higher up. She cursed the fact she
hadn't moved after her first shot.

Suddenly, she spotted her attacker, and barked out a laugh. The sound made the
pain come back twofold, and she winced. The sniper that shot her was hidden out
behind two giant chunks of granite left behind from the colony's mining
operations in the area. She'd always pestered the miners about not leaving shit
like that behind, because the enemy could use it as cover, but they'd always
waved her off like she was crazy. When she got back to camp, she thought, she'd
give them the comeuppance they deserved.

The sniper was on the radio, scanning the mountain face for any signs of Kas'
movements. Apparently, he hadn't seen her surreptitiously look right at him. He
wasn't paying attention to the path behind him, either. The two guards, both
armed with pump shotguns, grinned when they spotted him. They snuck up behind
him and positioned themselves so he'd have no escape.

They both pumped their shotguns at the same time, and the sniper spun around at
the noise. He managed a ""No, ple-"" before the guards pumped him full of lead. He
was barely recognizable after they finished with him; they slinked back to the
bunker the same way they came.

Kas popped out from cover. One of the gunners was standing by the river, calling
for the one that fell in when the fires began. She shot him in the torso, and he
followed his friend into the river, dying instantly. Three to go. The rest of
the bandit camp didn't even realize he was gone, as they were dealing with the
chemfuel leakages. The snipers moved up out of the valley and spread out,
looking for her. She had to go.

Kas radioed in again. ""Good work, boys,"" she singsonged. Gil replied.

""We've got readings of the long-range moving up,"" he said. ""You'd better get out
of there. How many guns are left?""

She got up, carefully. She could walk, her shoulder just hurt like hell. ""Three.
But I need to go. I'm sorry, Gil, I couldn't get them a-""

""Stop. It's fine. That's half of the gunners down, Kas, which is way better than
nothing. We can wait out the rest.""

She smiled, a little. ""I'm leaving, I'll meet you back at the nest. Out."" The
radio went silent.

She pitched her helmet on the rock, in full view of the snipers, and slunk out
the front of the nook. She ran quickly and easily, despite carrying her full
armored vest and gun with her, on an injured shoulder. She made good progress
down the mountainside, stopping at the base of it for a moment to survey the
situation.

She had a sprint across an open field. To her right, the bandit camp and forest
burned. She couldn't see any snipers, but she knew they were probably prone in
the grass. Behind her, going on in either direction for miles, was the mountain
range. She looked up at the nook she had been in, and could see the helmet was
already gone. They probably didn't fall for it, but it didn't hurt to shoot it
anyways.

In front of her, the field and river stretched parallel to the mountains. The
bridge looked to be some distance off, but she was lined up with it. It would be
a straight shot. Breinigsville's bunker laid on the other side. She could see
auto-turrets tracking slowly around, looking for a target, like stationary
mechanical guard dogs.

She heard a soft thunk, and a few seconds later, the first shell hit in the
river. Two more followed, each striking the water near the bridge.

Kas muttered to herself. ""Either they're terrible aims, or...""

The realization struck her. ""Shit. Shit. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. They're
aiming for the fucking bridge!""

Her radio buzzed, and Gil's voice crackled in all of its panicked timbre.

""Kas, you have to stay put. They're trying to smoke the bridge. If you get stuck
in that field, Kas-""

""It won't be much better being stuck here, Gil,"" she said grimly. ""I have to
go.""

""Kas, please. Just stay put. We can fight this fight in the field.""

""We need the auto-turrets, Gil. We have to have them. We'll lose if you come out
here.""

""Kas-""

She silenced the radio. She couldn't have him talking to her when she tried to
make this run.

There was another thunking noise, and three more shells rained down on the
bridge. They were getting closer. She knew she had to cross the field, now.

She started running. She ran as low to the ground as she could without losing
speed, but she knew that she was screwed if a sniper saw her and was able to
lead her with a bullet. Still, she was confident in her abilities. She'd never
been clapped before now, not severely. She ducked behind trees, took advantage
of all of the cover she could, and even ran behind a herd of elk. More shells
rained down on the bridge, but they couldn't seem to hit it. None of the ones
that hit the water exploded, but the chemfuel from the shells leaked and rose to
form a greasy film on top of the river. Kas could already see fish floating to
the surface. If no other damage occurred, they'd still probably have a hard
winter. They needed that river for food and water.

As she got closer, she felt a little haughty about her victory. Look at what
she'd done! And while they were going to have to wait out the mortar shells, she
was confident they'd not be able to fire them all before the colonists could
call one of the tribes for help. Everything was going to be alright, and she was
the one that stopped the raid, yet again. It was a good feeling. And she'd be
able to see Gil, and go home and sleep in their house after the day was done,
and maybe they'd cook together or just watch some TV, and look, there's Gil in
the bunker across the bridge, and I'm almost there -- oh, how he's going to fret
and worry about me when I get back, and tell me I should let one of the guys go
out and do my job next time, as if they could do it as well as I could, and-

A shell finally hit the bridge. She was 10, maybe 15 feet away from it. It
exploded, and the bridge instantly collapsed under the hellfire. The smoldering
pieces ignited the chemfuel in the water as they fell into the river, and the
conflagration spread instantly down the river a ways towards the bandit camp.
Gil screamed from the bunker.

The monolithic explosion threw Kas back, straight into a tree. She felt a rib or
two snap under the pressure, and her metal vest dented inwards painfully.
Flaming chemfuel from the explosion doused her, and her flesh seared. She
struggled to get her vest off, but the dent made it almost impossible. The heat
was unbearable. She screamed as the metal melted into her skin and dug into her
broken torso. Parts of her hair smoldered, and the overly-blackened parts of
her began to slough off. Her bandages burnt off, and she passed out from the
pain, slumped against a tree that itself began to burn in consort with her.

Gil couldn't see Kas, but he knew how close she was to the explosion. Readings
from their bunker console indicated that the bandits had started their assault.
Shells rained down on the town, igniting the food store and burning a part of
their winter crop. The smoke carried their dreams of a peaceful Breinigsville
into the sky from which they once came, when the founders crash landed their
escape pods into the river.

Gil knew they couldn't just sit there. The power supply could be shelled, the
geothermal generator, destroyed. And then where would they be? The auto-turrets
didn't have batteries. None of the town did, because they led to instability in
the power grid. They couldn't just hide in the mountain, they were outnumbered
and outgunned. They'd have to sortie into the field and fight them there. Yeah,
and then they could get Kas and bring her back and see how bad it is-

Gil stopped himself. He knew none of that was true. The power supply would hold,
and the mountain fortress was impregnable. But Kas...!

He looked around desperately at his men. The soldiers saw it in his eyes, and
nodded. They respected him, and respected Kas, too much not to do it.

They left the bunker, and started fording the river upstream from where it was
burning.

Gil didn't have a plan. He just wanted to get Kas out from wherever she was. He
knew that once they got across, they'd have to set up a defensive perimeter, but
he couldn't think straight when Kas was in danger. He told the empath that much,
and he nodded. He would direct the defenses. Gil could see the bandits, some
with shotguns, some with machine pistols, and others with rocket launchers
barreling down towards the colony. The troops spread out and started to fire at
them.

Gil stayed slightly behind and cast around frantically, looking for his other
half. The smoke from the burning forest choked him and made his eyes water. He
couldn't see anything, but he had to act fast, before the bodies from the
fighting started falling near him and confusing him in his search-

He saw a burning oak and a slumped over figure, and he knew. The sounds of the
vicious fighting quieted to a dull background roar as he approached her. He
thought he heard a scream as someone got shot, but he didn't pay very much
attention to it.

Kas was in bad shape. Her hair was singed, and her arms and legs were badly
burnt. They shined with a brilliant black hue. Her face was remarkably still
relatively okay, and her armor was only partially melted onto her. The burning
had stopped as the chemfuel was used up. Next to her was a hunk of metal that,
after a moment, he recognized to be what remained of her sniper rifle. She must
have held onto it as she was blown backwards.

Gil dropped his longsword and fell to his knees. He crawled towards her and
cradled her face. Her eyes fluttered open.

""G...Gil,"" she croaked out. ""Gil. I'm so sorry. I was stupid out there.""

""It's okay, Kas. We're going to get you out of here.""

""We...?"" Comprehension dawned in her eyes. Her hearing came back to her, and she
heard the shells falling on the guards, and the forest burning.

""You brought them out here, Gil.""

""I couldn't leave you here, Kas. Not like this.""

She normally would've been angry. A leader should look after his men, regardless
of his personal feelings on the matter. But she knew they had agreed to it. Of
course they did. And, above all, she just felt happy to see him again, one last
time.

He sat down next to her. A shell hit close by, which jolted them out of their
brief reverie.

""The fighting is getting closer..."" Gil said.

""I can't move,"" said Kas. ""I can't move.""

""No, Kas, you have to, we have to go-""

""Gil. I can't feel anything."" Her nerves were burnt.

Gil cursed. Kas lifted what remained of her hand, stiffly, and touched his face.

""You aren't going to leave if I tell you to, will you, Gil? Even to save
yourself?""

""Never,"" he replied.

She scoffed. The movement made her body scream with agony.

They sat for awhile, listening to the fighting. It sounded inconclusive.
Everywhere, shells were dropping, and they could hear the shots from the
fighting get closer and closer. Nobody could see them, because they were behind
a little hill that the oak tree had grown around, so when a part of the front
line broke and one of the machine pistol bandits ran around it and saw them, all
three of them were surprised.

There was a moment where they all just looked at each other. Gil, holding Kas,
and the bandit. They just stared for a moment. The bandit clearly saw that they
were unarmed, and the state that Kas was in, and he looked less like a horrible
enemy and more like a human being for a moment. Gil couldn't see his eyes, but
he thought the bandit might have hesitated for a moment before opening fire.

Gil turned his back to the bandit and shielded Kas from the attack, and the
bandit started firing from afar. They looked at each other for the split second
this was happening with the look that two people in love give each other before
they're about to die. Gil screamed involuntarily as the bullets riddled his
body.

Suddenly, they heard a choking noise, and the assault stopped. Gil struggled to
turn over, and saw the empath had buried his sword in the bandit's back. The
bandit fell to the ground, and his machine pistol clattered next to him. The
empath looked horrified, and dropped the sword as the bandit fell. He looked at
Gil and Kas.

""Gil... Kas..."" he sputtered.

""Go. Leave us and get everyone hiding in the storehouse and in the farm, and
hide in the mountain base. Leave the turrets up,"" Gil managed to gasp out.

""But, Gil, you're going to...""

""Go. We and the guards aren't fighting out here for nothing.""

The empath gave Gil a significant look. It's the kind of look that Gil thought
would keep him up at night, if he had more time. The empath picked up the
machine pistol and threw it over to the duo, and sprinted back. Gil saw him
successfully ford the river.

Gil turned to Kas, and they looked into each other's eyes. Kas' were watery.
From pain or from emotion, he didn't know.

""I'm sorry about all this, love...""

Kas just looked at him, and smiled. ""If it's going to happen here, and now, it's
better that we're together, at least.""

Gil looked at her, sadly. ""We could've had more. More time. For god's sake, Kas,
we're only 30-""

""But we didn't. We probably don't have more time. I know I don't. I'm just glad
we made the best of the time we had together.""

He paused.

""Remember Redbeard?,"" he said, after a moment.

She smiled. ""Of course I do. That mutt was unforgettable.""

""Remember when every morning, when we just got here, he'd go out and hunt a
squirrel or something? He practically fed himself.""

""Yeah. He was the weirdest warg I've ever met. He was way too cuddly to be a
mindless killing machine like he was supposed to be. He'd always watch TV with
us.""

They both chuckled. A few shells fell near them. Gil looked over and saw that
the bandit, who hadn't quite died, had radioed in their position.

""Doin' all of us a favor,"" the bandit said.

Gil took the machine pistol up and shot him with what was left in the clip.

""Well, I suppose he probably wanted to die alone anyways,"" Kas said. ""It's the
pirate lifestyle. No time to enjoy anything, just loot, loot, loot...""

Gil just looked out at the river. He saw that 4 guards were fording the water,
again, fleeing back into the fortress. A large group of bandits followed them,
firing at them and at the auto-turrets.

""Think they'll be okay?,"" he asked.

Kas mulled the question over for longer than he was comfortable with. ""I think
so. That mountain fortress was really, really secure. I just hope they're able
to call the tribe.""

A shell caught the opposite side of the hill they were hiding behind, and the
explosion showered them with dirt. They looked at each other; understanding was
in their eyes.

""So it's time, huh?,"" Kas said.

""We never had enough time, Kas. We never had enough time.""

Kas just put a finger to his lips. Her eyes shined brilliantly. His, darker than
hers, simmered.

Thunk. A shell fell near them, but not as near as the one before.

They just looked at each other.

""I love you,"" Gil said.

""I love you too,"" Kas said. She breathed shallowly.

Thunk. Thunk.

They were both keenly aware of just how inadequate language is at expressing
love. There was never enough time to show it. Not now, and probably not ever.

They embraced, and kissed.

A shell fell directly onto where they were sitting. Their bodies were vaporized
instantly, and the flames consumed whatever was left. Their ashes drifted into
the sky, and mingled with the ashes of the burning walls of Breinigsville; the
ashes of what might have been.

Never enough time.

Never.

"""Music is the most wondrous thing about humanity.""[Sometime in the latter portion of the 21st century]

""I've been working on this.""

Johnnie Mae, age 5, followed her legal mother to her studio. After a traumatic early childhood, she had been raised by Sue, a mechanoid robot with a human-based intelligence descended from the sort of shape-shifting robots first invented in the 2010s (for instance, 2017's ""Origami Wheel Transformer""). After the turbulent 2020s, humanity had put much of its faith in robots and humanoid artificial intelligences like Sue. At the same time, these robots were required to remain impartial in human politics unless they were willing to be fully reincarnated every 80-90 years; their model, the human brain, is very sensitive to input from early in its life-cycle, and for a silicon-based creature with an indefinite lifespan generational conflict would be inevitable if they were allowed to overrule humans. Instead, many of them took to labor and emergency services work, and in their downtime they often pursued the fine arts.

The two entered Sue's studio and saw a massive mural with faces and names: Billie Holiday. Louis Armstrong. Elvis. Edith Piaf. Chuck Berry. Ray Charles. Bob Dylan. Paul McCartney. Hank Williams. Buddy Holly. Ella Fitzgerald...and countless others.

""Aside from its capacity to learn from or at least acknowledge its flaws and ensure that we do not repeat them, music is the most wondrous thing about humanity. All of these men and women you see here had at least part of their career go through just one decade - 1950-1959 - and many came from challenging backgrounds. Ray Charles was blind, Johnnie Ray was deaf, Little Richard had a limp, Elvis grew up in public housing, and Brian Jones of the Stones started in the late 1950s as a street busker. Musical creativity is truly the great equalizer among men and women like you, sweetheart."""

Sorry but rimpy was crashing when I was trying to get this to Rentry"
"Improvements to game/slice of life suggestions, discussion and critique friendly1. A better way of assigning jobs and work orders, like: If Alpaca in pen >10 slaughter alpaca until = 10, or: If Eclipse = True then sun lamp = on. Simple stuff like that so we dont have to wait for the pawns to do it themselves, whats that mean you ask? Well thats the next thing.
2. Programable AND/OR gates/simple (non mechanoid) robotics, a research path after microelectronics that allows for the construction of simple robots, i.e. Auto harvester that collects crops or a cart that hauls crap. Think of them like smart cars for hauling n stuff and the grabber hands or auto docs from fallout ofc they'd have to be nerfed a bit but i could see it working.
3. More prosthetics, so everyone knows that losing even one digit in this game can be a bad thing, instead of cutting off someones foot cause they have a missing toe we had the ability to install a wooden toe instead i propose a prosthetic for every damagable part in the game i.e. Noses, fingers, ears, eyes (glass eyes) etc. etc., on top of that the ability to pick the material used in installation of primitive prosthetics i.e. Gold, steel, jade. In order to not only increase its durability but also increase mood from having a pretty prosthetic.
4. Treatment of bad traits through ethical and unethical treatment, pyromania is bad those who have it might end up burning down your base, mental breaks and catatonic moods can be just as bad! I propose treatment such as therapy and counseling be added to help treat these things before they get really bad, but also the quicker treatments like electroshock therapy and lobotomy if need be. That way you keep your good burning passion miner but he stops getting xp, loses the ability to social and basically becomes a brain dead drone that only mines all day.
5. More art and artistic expression. Ok this one is kinda ripped from dwarf fortress but do you guys know how dwarves can carve walls with art and history or tables etc? I propose the ability for pawns to be able to carve furniture to make it prettier and increase its value plus who wouldn't want to sit at a table engraved with a picture of someone getting brutalised?
6. Biome bleed, What i mean by this is that when two biomes meet, instead of it being one or the other its a lil of both i.e. When you settle at a border like one biomes bleeding into the other, like if its a tropical forest and a temperate one you'd see a scattering of both biomes trees, animals and plants.
7. Optional narration of events done by a in Morgan Freeman sounding dude in the style of a David Attenborough documentary with a beginning cutscene/slideshow that is just as corny as it sounds.
8. Tynan Sylvester himself as an AI storyteller.
9. Voice acting for AI storytellers for whatever they decide to use this for
10. Canon Backstory for AI storytellers cause makes me happy
11. Lore in general
12. A Book Series based on the game and a bestiary and lorebook for people like me who like reading about every little piece of lore from what is Randy's affiliation to the rimworld, was he a pirate, does he like pineapple pizza, did he survive a rimworld, is the game trying to say the storytellers are former colonists from our settlement retelling their escapades? Y'know lore.

Anyways, if theres anything you think i could improve in this list to make it less incomprehensible then leave a comment to let me know. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

Desclaimer: Ik most of these are mods but as a console gamer who can't mod the game these additions would be nice to have in game so i can use them! Sorry for confusion!"
"[Stories] Sacking of Breinigsville: A Rimworld Short Story[EDIT]: I don't want to self-advertise, but I can't figure out how to make this look nicer. If you want a (slightly) better format, you can read it here: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~benjamse/writings/rimworld_storytelling.txt

I


Once, I had two pawns named Kasumi and Gil. They lived in a colony called
Breinigsville. Breinigsville was the rare kind of colony where two people could
get away from the constant struggle for survival for awhile, and relax. It was a
large village, for a rimworld -- 15 people lived there altogether -- and most
things there were provided for them. There was never a shortage of food or nice
clothing for anyone, and any issues were rectified by paying one of the nearby
friendly tribes to send a caravan of goods to trade for the fine art that made
the colony famous.


Kasumi and Gil were soulmates. While they hadn't settled down and actually
gotten married yet, (after all, there are other things to worry about on the
Rim!) they were clearly and undoubtedly in love. They did everything together:
they went on walks, hewed art out of rocks in the same workshop, and they even
hunted together. Their schedules were synchronized, from the moment they woke up
in the morning to the moment they went to bed in their modest cabin. It was
separated by some distance from the block of houses that everyone else lived in;
they liked their privacy.


Kasumi was abrasive, and had ice water running through her veins instead of
blood. She was a crack shot with a sniper rifle, once downing a charging Thrumbo
with a headshot after it had injured or killed everyone else that tried to hunt
it. She was always the first one out to try to stop a bandit siege, picking off
the gunners of the giant mortar guns before they could even finish constructing
them. When not throwing herself headlong into situations that could only be
survived by a sniper of her caliber, she remained detached from most of the
others in the colony, except for Gil. She spent most of her days outside the
walls of the compound, hunting.

Gil, on the other hand, was a socialite. He was Breinigsville's main warden and
trader, which made him one of the more valuable members of the town. He was
friends with everyone, and spent much of his time training the others in how to
snatch a good deal or undercut the opposition without them noticing. Once, he
was able to save the colony after a brutal winter by selling one statuette for
an entire spring's worth of food; he then later bought back the same statuette
for half the cost. When in combat, he abhorred guns, preferring to get right up
close to the enemy with an enormous steel longsword.

They were perfect for each other, and despite Kasumi's reclusiveness, they were
both well-respected in the community. Most of the people who lived through the
tougher parts of the colony's history can recall tales of these two
singlehandedly saving it.

Breinigsville was the kind of place that could've probably survived without
their intervention, most of the time. There was a central compound where the
kitchens, storehouses, and artists worked, a set of individual houses where
everyone lived, a huge tract of farmland growing everything from rice to
healroot, and a massive geothermal generator and redundant power system
supporting it all. Surrounding all of this was a thick outer wall that had
repelled many bandit attacks before, and the only way to get to the town was
through a large bunker filled with auto-turrets.

These defenses had held out against many attacks in the 6 years since
Breinigsville had been founded. Even the massively powerful mechanoid robots
were repeatedly unable to breach its defenses. The only thing that had worried
the guard of the place had been the bandit sieges with their large, powerful
mortar guns.

Still, Breinigsville had always held against even the most determined assaults,
which is why when a 25-person bandit siege dropped in across the river, they
weren't really worried. Kasumi, as usual with her, immediately turned on the
matrix of auto-turrets and went out with her sniper rifle. Gil stayed behind
with the squad of defenders in the bunker.


II

Kasumi got within range of the bandits. They were haughtily building a perimeter
of sandbags and mortar guns, laughing and scheming about what they were going to
do with the riches looted from the famed vaults of Breinigsville, deep in the
mountain.

""Fuckers,"" she muttered to herself, laying down prone inside a nook in the
mountain wall. She extended the bipod on her sniper rifle and settled down to
wait. You always had to take out the mortar gunners, or else they'd shell the
defenses to the town as they attacked it.

She felt a tinge of uneasiness. There were a lot more bandits in this group than
usual. Breinigsville usually had about 7 or 8 competent troops to defend it, and
bandits usually attacked with about double that. With the thick defensive
perimeter the colonists fought behind, battles like this were usually a breeze.
They hadn't lost anyone for a year.

Yet, she was uncertain that she'd be able to kill them all this time. She
counted 6 gunners, and this time they also had snipers of their own. With the
right timing, and her silencer, she thought she might be able to take out 2 or 3
of them before they spotted her and returned fire.

Still, she wasn't about to withdraw. She was across the river from the colony,
which straddled one side of the steep banks. A huge mountain range stretched for
miles on either side of her, and she looked down across a vast plain towards the
valley where the bandits were set up. It was spring, so everything shined with a
scintillating green color. They'd have very little cover if they charged her, so
she'd probably be able to clap a few more of them before she needed to flee
across the bridge again. She had a long sprint to it, but she was confident that
she'd be able to make it if she timed it right.

She could see the colony engineers placing and activating more auto-turrets
outside of the bunker. It seemed like they'd realized how many of the bandits
there were, too.

She radioed in. ""Bre, do you copy?""

A staticky voice came through, which she recognized immediately as Gil's.

""Yeah, Kas, we're here. There's a lot of those shitheads out there, huh?""

""Yeah,"" Kas replied, ""and they have long-range, too.""

""Fuck."" He sounded worried. ""They're in the valley, so they won't be able to
fire on you if you run back now.""

""I can't do that, Gil. They have six mortars.""

He swore at that, again.

""Pull back. We can hide in the mountain, and fight them indoors where the
mortars can't hit us.""

""Gil,"" she said, snapping at him, ""we're outnumbered. The only way we can beat
these guys is with the auto-turrets, and you can't move them from the bunker in
time. Plus, I don't want the town to go up in flames while we cower in a cave. I
have to stay here.""

He sighed. ""Just... just be careful, alright? I can't go out there and help you
-- not with those snipers around.""

""I promise. This isn't any different than last year's siege.""

""I hope so,"" he replied. ""Out, for now."" The radio crackled, and then went
silent.

Her soulmate assuaged, for now, she turned her attention back to the bandit
camp. They wandered lazily around like they had all the time in the world,
building up sandbags around their big mortar guns. She looked for an opportunity
to clap one without anyone noticing, but they were all grouped in clumps of 3 or
4 as they constructed. There was one that looked like she was the leader,
ordering people around, but it was a pretty loose operation, overall; typical of
the pirate raids in this area of the rimworld. Some of them were run like
efficient militias, complete with actual army training and everything, but many
of them were just rabble with guns, under loose leadership.

She turned her scope up, slightly, and saw a streak of fire in the sky. She
lifted her head and saw a couple of drop pods barreling down, landing amongst
the mortars. The doors on each of them, primed with a small explosive, popped
off. Smoke from the landing obscured her view, and she went back to her scope to
try to see what the bandit home base had just dropped on them.

She saw a shadow of a figure through the thick smoke, and what looked like a
crate. As it began clearing, she saw that the crates held the shells for the
mortars. It looked like 200, maybe 300 shells, enough to bring a large chunk of
the mountain down on their heads if they let them fire them all.

She radioed in. One of the lead empaths -- diplomats who were not allowed to
harm anyone -- answered. When she told him the number of shells they had, she
could almost hear him blanch. He told her she had the go-ahead to fire.

Steadying herself, she looked through her scope again. She saw four of the
bandits clustered around one of the crates, having trouble opening it. One of
them fetched a crowbar, popped the lid off, and lifted one of the
coppery-looking shells in the air. Kas spotted a flaming symbol on the side of
the canister, indicative of a high-explosive round. Filled with chemfuel, they
would start a fire after they rained down on the town. The defenses wouldn't
stand a chance.

She held her breath and fired a round right into the shell the bandit was
holding. The shell exploding triggered its brethren in the crate, and the
shockwave tossed the rest of the attackers like rag dolls, slamming them into
the mountain walls and the mortar guns. The bandit that was holding the shell
was vaporized immediately, and his friends didn't fare much better. They
screamed in agony as the flaming chemfuel enveloped them, and one of them jumped
into the river and passed out from the pain. Later on, his catatonic body would
become food for the wolves.

Kas smiled. The fuckers deserved it.

One of the mortar guns melted in the inferno. A tree caught fire, and from there
the forest began to go up in flames. During the confusion, Kas managed to kill
two more of the bandits. She popped up and down, hiding behind a rock to avoid
the sights of the bandit snipers that had set up behind the sandbags. They
sweeped over the mountain passes, looking for any attackers as the rest of them
tried to put out the flames and apply some triage to their concussed friends.

She counted four gunners left. She popped out of cover, and aimed for one's
head.

In the five years she and Gil had been a members of Breinigsville, Kas had never
gotten injured. Not once. She had grown up as a member of an urbworld gang, so
she was no stranger to pain, or gunshot wounds, but as a colonist she was always
fairly removed from the action. The worst thing that had ever happened to her
was a 3-month stint with gut worms, which is why it was so surprising to her
when she was shot.

Initially, she didn't know what had happened. She was thrown back and hit her
head on the stone ceiling of the nook she was in. She sat there stunned for a
moment. Her vision was red. Then, the senses came back to her. She was dimly
aware of a throbbing, blisteringly hot pain coming from her left shoulder, and a
strong headache where she hit the back of her helmet on the cave ceiling. She
undid the strap to it and struggled to get it off; the dent was painfully
pressing in on the back of her head. Her short, brown hair glistened with slick
blood.

Another shot rang out, striking the entrance to the cave. Kas scrambled back
behind her rock, dragging her rifle with her. She had dropped it when she flew
back, but it looked to be in good shape. She radioed into the colony.

""Bre, Bre, come in. I've been clapped. Repeat, I've been clapped. I need help!""

Gil came on the com. ""Kas! Where are you hit? I'll send a party out right awa-""

She cut him off. ""Shoulder, Gil. I can still shoot. But I need someone to go out
and secure the other side of the mountain face. I can't get out of cover while
there's a sniper out there.""

She heard him speak unintelligibly to another one of the guards. ""Will they be
safe?""

""Yeah, just stay along the wall so he won't see you coming.""

Gil barked an order to one of the guards. ""They're on their way, just stay
tight. Out.""

Kas breathed in and held it. She couldn't do much while she was sitting there,
so she closed her eyes and focused on the pain. The bullet hadn't gone through
the back side of her armor vest, and was stopping much of the bleeding. Her
vision swam, and she did a small battle meditation that she learned in her time
as a convent child on her urbworld. Control the pain, they said. You can still
fight.

""Mi ne estas en doloro,"" she chanted, softly, in the ancient language of her
urbworld. I am not in pain.

It subsided, a little bit, and she bandaged the wound with her field medical
kit. She shifted to the side, and barely poked her scope around the edge of the
rock to see what was going on. It obscured her view of the bandit camp, but she
could see the smoke and ash rising from the burning forest. There was less
screaming, now, so presumably all of the bandits had gotten away from the
danger.

Through the scope, she scanned the mountain face. She could see two of the
colony's guards running around the edge of the mountain face, trying to stay out
of the sight of any of the snipers. They probably wouldn't be able to see them,
as the snipers were in a valley, but she was higher up. She cursed the fact she
hadn't moved after her first shot.

Suddenly, she spotted her attacker, and barked out a laugh. The sound made the
pain come back twofold, and she winced. The sniper that shot her was hidden out
behind two giant chunks of granite left behind from the colony's mining
operations in the area. She'd always pestered the miners about not leaving shit
like that behind, because the enemy could use it as cover, but they'd always
waved her off like she was crazy. When she got back to camp, she thought, she'd
give them the comeuppance they deserved.

The sniper was on the radio, scanning the mountain face for any signs of Kas'
movements. Apparently, he hadn't seen her surreptitiously look right at him. He
wasn't paying attention to the path behind him, either. The two guards, both
armed with pump shotguns, grinned when they spotted him. They snuck up behind
him and positioned themselves so he'd have no escape.

They both pumped their shotguns at the same time, and the sniper spun around at
the noise. He managed a ""No, ple-"" before the guards pumped him full of lead. He
was barely recognizable after they finished with him; they slinked back to the
bunker the same way they came.

Kas popped out from cover. One of the gunners was standing by the river, calling
for the one that fell in when the fires began. She shot him in the torso, and he
followed his friend into the river, dying instantly. Three to go. The rest of
the bandit camp didn't even realize he was gone, as they were dealing with the
chemfuel leakages. The snipers moved up out of the valley and spread out,
looking for her. She had to go.

Kas radioed in again. ""Good work, boys,"" she singsonged. Gil replied.

""We've got readings of the long-range moving up,"" he said. ""You'd better get out
of there. How many guns are left?""

She got up, carefully. She could walk, her shoulder just hurt like hell. ""Three.
But I need to go. I'm sorry, Gil, I couldn't get them a-""

""Stop. It's fine. That's half of the gunners down, Kas, which is way better than
nothing. We can wait out the rest.""

She smiled, a little. ""I'm leaving, I'll meet you back at the nest. Out."" The
radio went silent.

She pitched her helmet on the rock, in full view of the snipers, and slunk out
the front of the nook. She ran quickly and easily, despite carrying her full
armored vest and gun with her, on an injured shoulder. She made good progress
down the mountainside, stopping at the base of it for a moment to survey the
situation.

She had a sprint across an open field. To her right, the bandit camp and forest
burned. She couldn't see any snipers, but she knew they were probably prone in
the grass. Behind her, going on in either direction for miles, was the mountain
range. She looked up at the nook she had been in, and could see the helmet was
already gone. They probably didn't fall for it, but it didn't hurt to shoot it
anyways.

In front of her, the field and river stretched parallel to the mountains. The
bridge looked to be some distance off, but she was lined up with it. It would be
a straight shot. Breinigsville's bunker laid on the other side. She could see
auto-turrets tracking slowly around, looking for a target, like stationary
mechanical guard dogs.

She heard a soft thunk, and a few seconds later, the first shell hit in the
river. Two more followed, each striking the water near the bridge.

Kas muttered to herself. ""Either they're terrible aims, or...""

The realization struck her. ""Shit. Shit. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. They're
aiming for the fucking bridge!""

Her radio buzzed, and Gil's voice crackled in all of its panicked timbre.

""Kas, you have to stay put. They're trying to smoke the bridge. If you get stuck
in that field, Kas-""

""It won't be much better being stuck here, Gil,"" she said grimly. ""I have to
go.""

""Kas, please. Just stay put. We can fight this fight in the field.""

""We need the auto-turrets, Gil. We have to have them. We'll lose if you come out
here.""

""Kas-""

She silenced the radio. She couldn't have him talking to her when she tried to
make this run.

There was another thunking noise, and three more shells rained down on the
bridge. They were getting closer. She knew she had to cross the field, now.

She started running. She ran as low to the ground as she could without losing
speed, but she knew that she was screwed if a sniper saw her and was able to
lead her with a bullet. Still, she was confident in her abilities. She'd never
been clapped before now, not severely. She ducked behind trees, took advantage
of all of the cover she could, and even ran behind a herd of elk. More shells
rained down on the bridge, but they couldn't seem to hit it. None of the ones
that hit the water exploded, but the chemfuel from the shells leaked and rose to
form a greasy film on top of the river. Kas could already see fish floating to
the surface. If no other damage occurred, they'd still probably have a hard
winter. They needed that river for food and water.

As she got closer, she felt a little haughty about her victory. Look at what
she'd done! And while they were going to have to wait out the mortar shells, she
was confident they'd not be able to fire them all before the colonists could
call one of the tribes for help. Everything was going to be alright, and she was
the one that stopped the raid, yet again. It was a good feeling. And she'd be
able to see Gil, and go home and sleep in their house after the day was done,
and maybe they'd cook together or just watch some TV, and look, there's Gil in
the bunker across the bridge, and I'm almost there -- oh, how he's going to fret
and worry about me when I get back, and tell me I should let one of the guys go
out and do my job next time, as if they could do it as well as I could, and-

A shell finally hit the bridge. She was 10, maybe 15 feet away from it. It
exploded, and the bridge instantly collapsed under the hellfire. The smoldering
pieces ignited the chemfuel in the water as they fell into the river, and the
conflagration spread instantly down the river a ways towards the bandit camp.
Gil screamed from the bunker.

The monolithic explosion threw Kas back, straight into a tree. She felt a rib or
two snap under the pressure, and her metal vest dented inwards painfully.
Flaming chemfuel from the explosion doused her, and her flesh seared. She
struggled to get her vest off, but the dent made it almost impossible. The heat
was unbearable. She screamed as the metal melted into her skin and dug into her
broken torso. Parts of her hair smoldered, and the overly-blackened parts of
her began to slough off. Her bandages burnt off, and she passed out from the
pain, slumped against a tree that itself began to burn in consort with her.

Gil couldn't see Kas, but he knew how close she was to the explosion. Readings
from their bunker console indicated that the bandits had started their assault.
Shells rained down on the town, igniting the food store and burning a part of
their winter crop. The smoke carried their dreams of a peaceful Breinigsville
into the sky from which they once came, when the founders crash landed their
escape pods into the river.

Gil knew they couldn't just sit there. The power supply could be shelled, the
geothermal generator, destroyed. And then where would they be? The auto-turrets
didn't have batteries. None of the town did, because they led to instability in
the power grid. They couldn't just hide in the mountain, they were outnumbered
and outgunned. They'd have to sortie into the field and fight them there. Yeah,
and then they could get Kas and bring her back and see how bad it is-

Gil stopped himself. He knew none of that was true. The power supply would hold,
and the mountain fortress was impregnable. But Kas...!

He looked around desperately at his men. The soldiers saw it in his eyes, and
nodded. They respected him, and respected Kas, too much not to do it.

They left the bunker, and started fording the river upstream from where it was
burning.

Gil didn't have a plan. He just wanted to get Kas out from wherever she was. He
knew that once they got across, they'd have to set up a defensive perimeter, but
he couldn't think straight when Kas was in danger. He told the empath that much,
and he nodded. He would direct the defenses. Gil could see the bandits, some
with shotguns, some with machine pistols, and others with rocket launchers
barreling down towards the colony. The troops spread out and started to fire at
them.

Gil stayed slightly behind and cast around frantically, looking for his other
half. The smoke from the burning forest choked him and made his eyes water. He
couldn't see anything, but he had to act fast, before the bodies from the
fighting started falling near him and confusing him in his search-

He saw a burning oak and a slumped over figure, and he knew. The sounds of the
vicious fighting quieted to a dull background roar as he approached her. He
thought he heard a scream as someone got shot, but he didn't pay very much
attention to it.

Kas was in bad shape. Her hair was singed, and her arms and legs were badly
burnt. They shined with a brilliant black hue. Her face was remarkably still
relatively okay, and her armor was only partially melted onto her. The burning
had stopped as the chemfuel was used up. Next to her was a hunk of metal that,
after a moment, he recognized to be what remained of her sniper rifle. She must
have held onto it as she was blown backwards.

Gil dropped his longsword and fell to his knees. He crawled towards her and
cradled her face. Her eyes fluttered open.

""G...Gil,"" she croaked out. ""Gil. I'm so sorry. I was stupid out there.""

""It's okay, Kas. We're going to get you out of here.""

""We...?"" Comprehension dawned in her eyes. Her hearing came back to her, and she
heard the shells falling on the guards, and the forest burning.

""You brought them out here, Gil.""

""I couldn't leave you here, Kas. Not like this.""

She normally would've been angry. A leader should look after his men, regardless
of his personal feelings on the matter. But she knew they had agreed to it. Of
course they did. And, above all, she just felt happy to see him again, one last
time.

He sat down next to her. A shell hit close by, which jolted them out of their
brief reverie.

""The fighting is getting closer..."" Gil said.

""I can't move,"" said Kas. ""I can't move.""

""No, Kas, you have to, we have to go-""

""Gil. I can't feel anything."" Her nerves were burnt.

Gil cursed. Kas lifted what remained of her hand, stiffly, and touched his face.

""You aren't going to leave if I tell you to, will you, Gil? Even to save
yourself?""

""Never,"" he replied.

She scoffed. The movement made her body scream with agony.

They sat for awhile, listening to the fighting. It sounded inconclusive.
Everywhere, shells were dropping, and they could hear the shots from the
fighting get closer and closer. Nobody could see them, because they were behind
a little hill that the oak tree had grown around, so when a part of the front
line broke and one of the machine pistol bandits ran around it and saw them, all
three of them were surprised.

There was a moment where they all just looked at each other. Gil, holding Kas,
and the bandit. They just stared for a moment. The bandit clearly saw that they
were unarmed, and the state that Kas was in, and he looked less like a horrible
enemy and more like a human being for a moment. Gil couldn't see his eyes, but
he thought the bandit might have hesitated for a moment before opening fire.

Gil turned his back to the bandit and shielded Kas from the attack, and the
bandit started firing from afar. They looked at each other for the split second
this was happening with the look that two people in love give each other before
they're about to die. Gil screamed involuntarily as the bullets riddled his
body.

Suddenly, they heard a choking noise, and the assault stopped. Gil struggled to
turn over, and saw the empath had buried his sword in the bandit's back. The
bandit fell to the ground, and his machine pistol clattered next to him. The
empath looked horrified, and dropped the sword as the bandit fell. He looked at
Gil and Kas.

""Gil... Kas..."" he sputtered.

""Go. Leave us and get everyone hiding in the storehouse and in the farm, and
hide in the mountain base. Leave the turrets up,"" Gil managed to gasp out.

""But, Gil, you're going to...""

""Go. We and the guards aren't fighting out here for nothing.""

The empath gave Gil a significant look. It's the kind of look that Gil thought
would keep him up at night, if he had more time. The empath picked up the
machine pistol and threw it over to the duo, and sprinted back. Gil saw him
successfully ford the river.

Gil turned to Kas, and they looked into each other's eyes. Kas' were watery.
From pain or from emotion, he didn't know.

""I'm sorry about all this, love...""

Kas just looked at him, and smiled. ""If it's going to happen here, and now, it's
better that we're together, at least.""

Gil looked at her, sadly. ""We could've had more. More time. For god's sake, Kas,
we're only 30-""

""But we didn't. We probably don't have more time. I know I don't. I'm just glad
we made the best of the time we had together.""

He paused.

""Remember Redbeard?,"" he said, after a moment.

She smiled. ""Of course I do. That mutt was unforgettable.""

""Remember when every morning, when we just got here, he'd go out and hunt a
squirrel or something? He practically fed himself.""

""Yeah. He was the weirdest warg I've ever met. He was way too cuddly to be a
mindless killing machine like he was supposed to be. He'd always watch TV with
us.""

They both chuckled. A few shells fell near them. Gil looked over and saw that
the bandit, who hadn't quite died, had radioed in their position.

""Doin' all of us a favor,"" the bandit said.

Gil took the machine pistol up and shot him with what was left in the clip.

""Well, I suppose he probably wanted to die alone anyways,"" Kas said. ""It's the
pirate lifestyle. No time to enjoy anything, just loot, loot, loot...""

Gil just looked out at the river. He saw that 4 guards were fording the water,
again, fleeing back into the fortress. A large group of bandits followed them,
firing at them and at the auto-turrets.

""Think they'll be okay?,"" he asked.

Kas mulled the question over for longer than he was comfortable with. ""I think
so. That mountain fortress was really, really secure. I just hope they're able
to call the tribe.""

A shell caught the opposite side of the hill they were hiding behind, and the
explosion showered them with dirt. They looked at each other; understanding was
in their eyes.

""So it's time, huh?,"" Kas said.

""We never had enough time, Kas. We never had enough time.""

Kas just put a finger to his lips. Her eyes shined brilliantly. His, darker than
hers, simmered.

Thunk. A shell fell near them, but not as near as the one before.

They just looked at each other.

""I love you,"" Gil said.

""I love you too,"" Kas said. She breathed shallowly.

Thunk. Thunk.

They were both keenly aware of just how inadequate language is at expressing
love. There was never enough time to show it. Not now, and probably not ever.

They embraced, and kissed.

A shell fell directly onto where they were sitting. Their bodies were vaporized
instantly, and the flames consumed whatever was left. Their ashes drifted into
the sky, and mingled with the ashes of the burning walls of Breinigsville; the
ashes of what might have been.

Never enough time.

Never.

"A drink after the fanfic[2069]

Setting: A dimly-lit bar or pub, the air filled with low-THC cannabis smoke to add a *noir* ambiance without the problem of cancer. The fading daylight is visible through the bar's French doors and intricate wrought-iron security gates. On the back wall is the famed Victorian-era painting of dogs playing poker; a few chinoiserie pots sit on a shelf beyond human reach. Faintly visible on the street is a wheeled mechanoid robot, amusing himself with a ball while waiting for his master to return. An older man, a harmonica and some Native American feathers around his neck and a fedora on his head, is reminiscing to the other patrons at the counter.

""Ah, the 2020s. Remember them? They were the Transformers fanfic of decades. UFOs, generational conflict, robots, drones, climate destruction, disease, famine, disease-fighting robots, ethnic tension, war, shapeshifting robots, an energy crisis, and an almost complete collapse of trust in the world's governments. Beer, please.""

The bartender looked at the old men.

""Okay. That'll be 500 cents.""

The harmonica man handed him a few bills and coins and began rambling on to no-one in particular. ""What we realized, when we staggered out the other side, was that we as a species needed to look backward to go forward. To embrace a more traditional way of life, smaller-scale. Small homes, small markets, tight-knit neighborhoods. To embrace the weird, the fantastic - to schedule around carnivals and celebration and make things less serious and less focused on squeezing every cent of profit out of each other. To embrace, or at least tolerate, old-age and natural death as necessary for human society to turn over and for old prejudices to gradually pass into the books of history - and what better way to do that than with a tragicomic jazz funeral? And to embrace both cultural diversity and integration, opening up the toy chest of thousands of years and hundreds of cultures' worth of human experience in order to play with and re-combine them in new ways."" 

He put the old French harp to his mouth and blew out a couple of notes, then moseying older to an upright piano. He pulled out a dead-tree book, its pages worn from years of abuse, and set it on the stand where sheet music should go. 

""To put it poetically, we had to go way back to old New Orleans. It was written in the 1870s by the great Lafcadio Hearn -- 'For a hundred years and more has New Orleans been drawing hither wandering souls from all the ends of the earth. The natives of India and of Japan have walked upon her pavements; Chinese and swarthy natives of Manila; children of the Antilles and of South America; subjects of the Sultan and sailors of the Ionian Sea have sought homes here. All civilized nations have sent wandering children hither. All cities of the North, East, and West have yielded up some restless souls to the far-off Southern city, whose spell is so mystic, so sweet, so universal.' Here we saw a place that, for its time, was relatively tolerant; where black voodoo kings and queens could live alongside immigrants from all over Europe and Asia, all bringing ancient traditions together from the Graeco-Roman aesthetic of Carnival to primitive African religion, and many of its racial and economic problems could be attributed to interference from 'the Americans.'""

""Do y'all want to hear some authentic New Orleans music tonight, or are you just feeling a bit grey and boring?"""
"Some questions about Ideology.I never quite payed any attention to Ideology in my games, so I have to ask something about it.

So I have chosen collectivists, because work drive for 9 days is just awesome. I noticed that, collectivist don't do drugs, so I just deleted this part in main menu. Did I literally cheated or it's ok? Looks like you can make pretty OP ideology just from the start.

Next I found my tribe in great mountain map with  **ancient danger** nearby. Killed some bugs and made it my new home.  They do not need rooms, right? They looks pretty happy with this little posh building.

And what are  weaknesses of collectivists after all that?

Sorry but rimpy was crashing when I was trying to get this to Rentry"
"A drink after the fanfic[2069]

Setting: A dimly-lit bar or pub, the air filled with low-THC cannabis smoke to add a *noir* ambiance without the problem of cancer. The fading daylight is visible through the bar's French doors and intricate wrought-iron security gates. On the back wall is the famed Victorian-era painting of dogs playing poker; a few chinoiserie pots sit on a shelf beyond human reach. Faintly visible on the street is a wheeled mechanoid robot, amusing himself with a ball while waiting for his master to return. An older man, a harmonica and some Native American feathers around his neck and a fedora on his head, is reminiscing to the other patrons at the counter.

""Ah, the 2020s. Remember them? They were the Transformers fanfic of decades. UFOs, generational conflict, robots, drones, climate destruction, disease, famine, disease-fighting robots, ethnic tension, war, shapeshifting robots, an energy crisis, and an almost complete collapse of trust in the world's governments. Beer, please.""

The bartender looked at the old men.

""Okay. That'll be 500 cents.""

The harmonica man handed him a few bills and coins and began rambling on to no-one in particular. ""What we realized, when we staggered out the other side, was that we as a species needed to look backward to go forward. To embrace a more traditional way of life, smaller-scale. Small homes, small markets, tight-knit neighborhoods. To embrace the weird, the fantastic - to schedule around carnivals and celebration and make things less serious and less focused on squeezing every cent of profit out of each other. To embrace, or at least tolerate, old-age and natural death as necessary for human society to turn over and for old prejudices to gradually pass into the books of history - and what better way to do that than with a tragicomic jazz funeral? And to embrace both cultural diversity and integration, opening up the toy chest of thousands of years and hundreds of cultures' worth of human experience in order to play with and re-combine them in new ways."" 

He put the old French harp to his mouth and blew out a couple of notes, then moseying older to an upright piano. He pulled out a dead-tree book, its pages worn from years of abuse, and set it on the stand where sheet music should go. 

""To put it poetically, we had to go way back to old New Orleans. It was written in the 1870s by the great Lafcadio Hearn -- 'For a hundred years and more has New Orleans been drawing hither wandering souls from all the ends of the earth. The natives of India and of Japan have walked upon her pavements; Chinese and swarthy natives of Manila; children of the Antilles and of South America; subjects of the Sultan and sailors of the Ionian Sea have sought homes here. All civilized nations have sent wandering children hither. All cities of the North, East, and West have yielded up some restless souls to the far-off Southern city, whose spell is so mystic, so sweet, so universal.' Here we saw a place that, for its time, was relatively tolerant; where black voodoo kings and queens could live alongside immigrants from all over Europe and Asia, all bringing ancient traditions together from the Graeco-Roman aesthetic of Carnival to primitive African religion, and many of its racial and economic problems could be attributed to interference from 'the Americans.'""

""Do y'all want to hear some authentic New Orleans music tonight, or are you just feeling a bit grey and boring?"""
"[Stories] Sacking of Breinigsville: A Rimworld Short Story[EDIT]: I don't want to self-advertise, but I can't figure out how to make this look nicer. If you want a (slightly) better format, you can read it here: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~benjamse/writings/rimworld_storytelling.txt

I


Once, I had two pawns named Kasumi and Gil. They lived in a colony called
Breinigsville. Breinigsville was the rare kind of colony where two people could
get away from the constant struggle for survival for awhile, and relax. It was a
large village, for a rimworld -- 15 people lived there altogether -- and most
things there were provided for them. There was never a shortage of food or nice
clothing for anyone, and any issues were rectified by paying one of the nearby
friendly tribes to send a caravan of goods to trade for the fine art that made
the colony famous.


Kasumi and Gil were soulmates. While they hadn't settled down and actually
gotten married yet, (after all, there are other things to worry about on the
Rim!) they were clearly and undoubtedly in love. They did everything together:
they went on walks, hewed art out of rocks in the same workshop, and they even
hunted together. Their schedules were synchronized, from the moment they woke up
in the morning to the moment they went to bed in their modest cabin. It was
separated by some distance from the block of houses that everyone else lived in;
they liked their privacy.


Kasumi was abrasive, and had ice water running through her veins instead of
blood. She was a crack shot with a sniper rifle, once downing a charging Thrumbo
with a headshot after it had injured or killed everyone else that tried to hunt
it. She was always the first one out to try to stop a bandit siege, picking off
the gunners of the giant mortar guns before they could even finish constructing
them. When not throwing herself headlong into situations that could only be
survived by a sniper of her caliber, she remained detached from most of the
others in the colony, except for Gil. She spent most of her days outside the
walls of the compound, hunting.

Gil, on the other hand, was a socialite. He was Breinigsville's main warden and
trader, which made him one of the more valuable members of the town. He was
friends with everyone, and spent much of his time training the others in how to
snatch a good deal or undercut the opposition without them noticing. Once, he
was able to save the colony after a brutal winter by selling one statuette for
an entire spring's worth of food; he then later bought back the same statuette
for half the cost. When in combat, he abhorred guns, preferring to get right up
close to the enemy with an enormous steel longsword.

They were perfect for each other, and despite Kasumi's reclusiveness, they were
both well-respected in the community. Most of the people who lived through the
tougher parts of the colony's history can recall tales of these two
singlehandedly saving it.

Breinigsville was the kind of place that could've probably survived without
their intervention, most of the time. There was a central compound where the
kitchens, storehouses, and artists worked, a set of individual houses where
everyone lived, a huge tract of farmland growing everything from rice to
healroot, and a massive geothermal generator and redundant power system
supporting it all. Surrounding all of this was a thick outer wall that had
repelled many bandit attacks before, and the only way to get to the town was
through a large bunker filled with auto-turrets.

These defenses had held out against many attacks in the 6 years since
Breinigsville had been founded. Even the massively powerful mechanoid robots
were repeatedly unable to breach its defenses. The only thing that had worried
the guard of the place had been the bandit sieges with their large, powerful
mortar guns.

Still, Breinigsville had always held against even the most determined assaults,
which is why when a 25-person bandit siege dropped in across the river, they
weren't really worried. Kasumi, as usual with her, immediately turned on the
matrix of auto-turrets and went out with her sniper rifle. Gil stayed behind
with the squad of defenders in the bunker.


II

Kasumi got within range of the bandits. They were haughtily building a perimeter
of sandbags and mortar guns, laughing and scheming about what they were going to
do with the riches looted from the famed vaults of Breinigsville, deep in the
mountain.

""Fuckers,"" she muttered to herself, laying down prone inside a nook in the
mountain wall. She extended the bipod on her sniper rifle and settled down to
wait. You always had to take out the mortar gunners, or else they'd shell the
defenses to the town as they attacked it.

She felt a tinge of uneasiness. There were a lot more bandits in this group than
usual. Breinigsville usually had about 7 or 8 competent troops to defend it, and
bandits usually attacked with about double that. With the thick defensive
perimeter the colonists fought behind, battles like this were usually a breeze.
They hadn't lost anyone for a year.

Yet, she was uncertain that she'd be able to kill them all this time. She
counted 6 gunners, and this time they also had snipers of their own. With the
right timing, and her silencer, she thought she might be able to take out 2 or 3
of them before they spotted her and returned fire.

Still, she wasn't about to withdraw. She was across the river from the colony,
which straddled one side of the steep banks. A huge mountain range stretched for
miles on either side of her, and she looked down across a vast plain towards the
valley where the bandits were set up. It was spring, so everything shined with a
scintillating green color. They'd have very little cover if they charged her, so
she'd probably be able to clap a few more of them before she needed to flee
across the bridge again. She had a long sprint to it, but she was confident that
she'd be able to make it if she timed it right.

She could see the colony engineers placing and activating more auto-turrets
outside of the bunker. It seemed like they'd realized how many of the bandits
there were, too.

She radioed in. ""Bre, do you copy?""

A staticky voice came through, which she recognized immediately as Gil's.

""Yeah, Kas, we're here. There's a lot of those shitheads out there, huh?""

""Yeah,"" Kas replied, ""and they have long-range, too.""

""Fuck."" He sounded worried. ""They're in the valley, so they won't be able to
fire on you if you run back now.""

""I can't do that, Gil. They have six mortars.""

He swore at that, again.

""Pull back. We can hide in the mountain, and fight them indoors where the
mortars can't hit us.""

""Gil,"" she said, snapping at him, ""we're outnumbered. The only way we can beat
these guys is with the auto-turrets, and you can't move them from the bunker in
time. Plus, I don't want the town to go up in flames while we cower in a cave. I
have to stay here.""

He sighed. ""Just... just be careful, alright? I can't go out there and help you
-- not with those snipers around.""

""I promise. This isn't any different than last year's siege.""

""I hope so,"" he replied. ""Out, for now."" The radio crackled, and then went
silent.

Her soulmate assuaged, for now, she turned her attention back to the bandit
camp. They wandered lazily around like they had all the time in the world,
building up sandbags around their big mortar guns. She looked for an opportunity
to clap one without anyone noticing, but they were all grouped in clumps of 3 or
4 as they constructed. There was one that looked like she was the leader,
ordering people around, but it was a pretty loose operation, overall; typical of
the pirate raids in this area of the rimworld. Some of them were run like
efficient militias, complete with actual army training and everything, but many
of them were just rabble with guns, under loose leadership.

She turned her scope up, slightly, and saw a streak of fire in the sky. She
lifted her head and saw a couple of drop pods barreling down, landing amongst
the mortars. The doors on each of them, primed with a small explosive, popped
off. Smoke from the landing obscured her view, and she went back to her scope to
try to see what the bandit home base had just dropped on them.

She saw a shadow of a figure through the thick smoke, and what looked like a
crate. As it began clearing, she saw that the crates held the shells for the
mortars. It looked like 200, maybe 300 shells, enough to bring a large chunk of
the mountain down on their heads if they let them fire them all.

She radioed in. One of the lead empaths -- diplomats who were not allowed to
harm anyone -- answered. When she told him the number of shells they had, she
could almost hear him blanch. He told her she had the go-ahead to fire.

Steadying herself, she looked through her scope again. She saw four of the
bandits clustered around one of the crates, having trouble opening it. One of
them fetched a crowbar, popped the lid off, and lifted one of the
coppery-looking shells in the air. Kas spotted a flaming symbol on the side of
the canister, indicative of a high-explosive round. Filled with chemfuel, they
would start a fire after they rained down on the town. The defenses wouldn't
stand a chance.

She held her breath and fired a round right into the shell the bandit was
holding. The shell exploding triggered its brethren in the crate, and the
shockwave tossed the rest of the attackers like rag dolls, slamming them into
the mountain walls and the mortar guns. The bandit that was holding the shell
was vaporized immediately, and his friends didn't fare much better. They
screamed in agony as the flaming chemfuel enveloped them, and one of them jumped
into the river and passed out from the pain. Later on, his catatonic body would
become food for the wolves.

Kas smiled. The fuckers deserved it.

One of the mortar guns melted in the inferno. A tree caught fire, and from there
the forest began to go up in flames. During the confusion, Kas managed to kill
two more of the bandits. She popped up and down, hiding behind a rock to avoid
the sights of the bandit snipers that had set up behind the sandbags. They
sweeped over the mountain passes, looking for any attackers as the rest of them
tried to put out the flames and apply some triage to their concussed friends.

She counted four gunners left. She popped out of cover, and aimed for one's
head.

In the five years she and Gil had been a members of Breinigsville, Kas had never
gotten injured. Not once. She had grown up as a member of an urbworld gang, so
she was no stranger to pain, or gunshot wounds, but as a colonist she was always
fairly removed from the action. The worst thing that had ever happened to her
was a 3-month stint with gut worms, which is why it was so surprising to her
when she was shot.

Initially, she didn't know what had happened. She was thrown back and hit her
head on the stone ceiling of the nook she was in. She sat there stunned for a
moment. Her vision was red. Then, the senses came back to her. She was dimly
aware of a throbbing, blisteringly hot pain coming from her left shoulder, and a
strong headache where she hit the back of her helmet on the cave ceiling. She
undid the strap to it and struggled to get it off; the dent was painfully
pressing in on the back of her head. Her short, brown hair glistened with slick
blood.

Another shot rang out, striking the entrance to the cave. Kas scrambled back
behind her rock, dragging her rifle with her. She had dropped it when she flew
back, but it looked to be in good shape. She radioed into the colony.

""Bre, Bre, come in. I've been clapped. Repeat, I've been clapped. I need help!""

Gil came on the com. ""Kas! Where are you hit? I'll send a party out right awa-""

She cut him off. ""Shoulder, Gil. I can still shoot. But I need someone to go out
and secure the other side of the mountain face. I can't get out of cover while
there's a sniper out there.""

She heard him speak unintelligibly to another one of the guards. ""Will they be
safe?""

""Yeah, just stay along the wall so he won't see you coming.""

Gil barked an order to one of the guards. ""They're on their way, just stay
tight. Out.""

Kas breathed in and held it. She couldn't do much while she was sitting there,
so she closed her eyes and focused on the pain. The bullet hadn't gone through
the back side of her armor vest, and was stopping much of the bleeding. Her
vision swam, and she did a small battle meditation that she learned in her time
as a convent child on her urbworld. Control the pain, they said. You can still
fight.

""Mi ne estas en doloro,"" she chanted, softly, in the ancient language of her
urbworld. I am not in pain.

It subsided, a little bit, and she bandaged the wound with her field medical
kit. She shifted to the side, and barely poked her scope around the edge of the
rock to see what was going on. It obscured her view of the bandit camp, but she
could see the smoke and ash rising from the burning forest. There was less
screaming, now, so presumably all of the bandits had gotten away from the
danger.

Through the scope, she scanned the mountain face. She could see two of the
colony's guards running around the edge of the mountain face, trying to stay out
of the sight of any of the snipers. They probably wouldn't be able to see them,
as the snipers were in a valley, but she was higher up. She cursed the fact she
hadn't moved after her first shot.

Suddenly, she spotted her attacker, and barked out a laugh. The sound made the
pain come back twofold, and she winced. The sniper that shot her was hidden out
behind two giant chunks of granite left behind from the colony's mining
operations in the area. She'd always pestered the miners about not leaving shit
like that behind, because the enemy could use it as cover, but they'd always
waved her off like she was crazy. When she got back to camp, she thought, she'd
give them the comeuppance they deserved.

The sniper was on the radio, scanning the mountain face for any signs of Kas'
movements. Apparently, he hadn't seen her surreptitiously look right at him. He
wasn't paying attention to the path behind him, either. The two guards, both
armed with pump shotguns, grinned when they spotted him. They snuck up behind
him and positioned themselves so he'd have no escape.

They both pumped their shotguns at the same time, and the sniper spun around at
the noise. He managed a ""No, ple-"" before the guards pumped him full of lead. He
was barely recognizable after they finished with him; they slinked back to the
bunker the same way they came.

Kas popped out from cover. One of the gunners was standing by the river, calling
for the one that fell in when the fires began. She shot him in the torso, and he
followed his friend into the river, dying instantly. Three to go. The rest of
the bandit camp didn't even realize he was gone, as they were dealing with the
chemfuel leakages. The snipers moved up out of the valley and spread out,
looking for her. She had to go.

Kas radioed in again. ""Good work, boys,"" she singsonged. Gil replied.

""We've got readings of the long-range moving up,"" he said. ""You'd better get out
of there. How many guns are left?""

She got up, carefully. She could walk, her shoulder just hurt like hell. ""Three.
But I need to go. I'm sorry, Gil, I couldn't get them a-""

""Stop. It's fine. That's half of the gunners down, Kas, which is way better than
nothing. We can wait out the rest.""

She smiled, a little. ""I'm leaving, I'll meet you back at the nest. Out."" The
radio went silent.

She pitched her helmet on the rock, in full view of the snipers, and slunk out
the front of the nook. She ran quickly and easily, despite carrying her full
armored vest and gun with her, on an injured shoulder. She made good progress
down the mountainside, stopping at the base of it for a moment to survey the
situation.

She had a sprint across an open field. To her right, the bandit camp and forest
burned. She couldn't see any snipers, but she knew they were probably prone in
the grass. Behind her, going on in either direction for miles, was the mountain
range. She looked up at the nook she had been in, and could see the helmet was
already gone. They probably didn't fall for it, but it didn't hurt to shoot it
anyways.

In front of her, the field and river stretched parallel to the mountains. The
bridge looked to be some distance off, but she was lined up with it. It would be
a straight shot. Breinigsville's bunker laid on the other side. She could see
auto-turrets tracking slowly around, looking for a target, like stationary
mechanical guard dogs.

She heard a soft thunk, and a few seconds later, the first shell hit in the
river. Two more followed, each striking the water near the bridge.

Kas muttered to herself. ""Either they're terrible aims, or...""

The realization struck her. ""Shit. Shit. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. They're
aiming for the fucking bridge!""

Her radio buzzed, and Gil's voice crackled in all of its panicked timbre.

""Kas, you have to stay put. They're trying to smoke the bridge. If you get stuck
in that field, Kas-""

""It won't be much better being stuck here, Gil,"" she said grimly. ""I have to
go.""

""Kas, please. Just stay put. We can fight this fight in the field.""

""We need the auto-turrets, Gil. We have to have them. We'll lose if you come out
here.""

""Kas-""

She silenced the radio. She couldn't have him talking to her when she tried to
make this run.

There was another thunking noise, and three more shells rained down on the
bridge. They were getting closer. She knew she had to cross the field, now.

She started running. She ran as low to the ground as she could without losing
speed, but she knew that she was screwed if a sniper saw her and was able to
lead her with a bullet. Still, she was confident in her abilities. She'd never
been clapped before now, not severely. She ducked behind trees, took advantage
of all of the cover she could, and even ran behind a herd of elk. More shells
rained down on the bridge, but they couldn't seem to hit it. None of the ones
that hit the water exploded, but the chemfuel from the shells leaked and rose to
form a greasy film on top of the river. Kas could already see fish floating to
the surface. If no other damage occurred, they'd still probably have a hard
winter. They needed that river for food and water.

As she got closer, she felt a little haughty about her victory. Look at what
she'd done! And while they were going to have to wait out the mortar shells, she
was confident they'd not be able to fire them all before the colonists could
call one of the tribes for help. Everything was going to be alright, and she was
the one that stopped the raid, yet again. It was a good feeling. And she'd be
able to see Gil, and go home and sleep in their house after the day was done,
and maybe they'd cook together or just watch some TV, and look, there's Gil in
the bunker across the bridge, and I'm almost there -- oh, how he's going to fret
and worry about me when I get back, and tell me I should let one of the guys go
out and do my job next time, as if they could do it as well as I could, and-

A shell finally hit the bridge. She was 10, maybe 15 feet away from it. It
exploded, and the bridge instantly collapsed under the hellfire. The smoldering
pieces ignited the chemfuel in the water as they fell into the river, and the
conflagration spread instantly down the river a ways towards the bandit camp.
Gil screamed from the bunker.

The monolithic explosion threw Kas back, straight into a tree. She felt a rib or
two snap under the pressure, and her metal vest dented inwards painfully.
Flaming chemfuel from the explosion doused her, and her flesh seared. She
struggled to get her vest off, but the dent made it almost impossible. The heat
was unbearable. She screamed as the metal melted into her skin and dug into her
broken torso. Parts of her hair smoldered, and the overly-blackened parts of
her began to slough off. Her bandages burnt off, and she passed out from the
pain, slumped against a tree that itself began to burn in consort with her.

Gil couldn't see Kas, but he knew how close she was to the explosion. Readings
from their bunker console indicated that the bandits had started their assault.
Shells rained down on the town, igniting the food store and burning a part of
their winter crop. The smoke carried their dreams of a peaceful Breinigsville
into the sky from which they once came, when the founders crash landed their
escape pods into the river.

Gil knew they couldn't just sit there. The power supply could be shelled, the
geothermal generator, destroyed. And then where would they be? The auto-turrets
didn't have batteries. None of the town did, because they led to instability in
the power grid. They couldn't just hide in the mountain, they were outnumbered
and outgunned. They'd have to sortie into the field and fight them there. Yeah,
and then they could get Kas and bring her back and see how bad it is-

Gil stopped himself. He knew none of that was true. The power supply would hold,
and the mountain fortress was impregnable. But Kas...!

He looked around desperately at his men. The soldiers saw it in his eyes, and
nodded. They respected him, and respected Kas, too much not to do it.

They left the bunker, and started fording the river upstream from where it was
burning.

Gil didn't have a plan. He just wanted to get Kas out from wherever she was. He
knew that once they got across, they'd have to set up a defensive perimeter, but
he couldn't think straight when Kas was in danger. He told the empath that much,
and he nodded. He would direct the defenses. Gil could see the bandits, some
with shotguns, some with machine pistols, and others with rocket launchers
barreling down towards the colony. The troops spread out and started to fire at
them.

Gil stayed slightly behind and cast around frantically, looking for his other
half. The smoke from the burning forest choked him and made his eyes water. He
couldn't see anything, but he had to act fast, before the bodies from the
fighting started falling near him and confusing him in his search-

He saw a burning oak and a slumped over figure, and he knew. The sounds of the
vicious fighting quieted to a dull background roar as he approached her. He
thought he heard a scream as someone got shot, but he didn't pay very much
attention to it.

Kas was in bad shape. Her hair was singed, and her arms and legs were badly
burnt. They shined with a brilliant black hue. Her face was remarkably still
relatively okay, and her armor was only partially melted onto her. The burning
had stopped as the chemfuel was used up. Next to her was a hunk of metal that,
after a moment, he recognized to be what remained of her sniper rifle. She must
have held onto it as she was blown backwards.

Gil dropped his longsword and fell to his knees. He crawled towards her and
cradled her face. Her eyes fluttered open.

""G...Gil,"" she croaked out. ""Gil. I'm so sorry. I was stupid out there.""

""It's okay, Kas. We're going to get you out of here.""

""We...?"" Comprehension dawned in her eyes. Her hearing came back to her, and she
heard the shells falling on the guards, and the forest burning.

""You brought them out here, Gil.""

""I couldn't leave you here, Kas. Not like this.""

She normally would've been angry. A leader should look after his men, regardless
of his personal feelings on the matter. But she knew they had agreed to it. Of
course they did. And, above all, she just felt happy to see him again, one last
time.

He sat down next to her. A shell hit close by, which jolted them out of their
brief reverie.

""The fighting is getting closer..."" Gil said.

""I can't move,"" said Kas. ""I can't move.""

""No, Kas, you have to, we have to go-""

""Gil. I can't feel anything."" Her nerves were burnt.

Gil cursed. Kas lifted what remained of her hand, stiffly, and touched his face.

""You aren't going to leave if I tell you to, will you, Gil? Even to save
yourself?""

""Never,"" he replied.

She scoffed. The movement made her body scream with agony.

They sat for awhile, listening to the fighting. It sounded inconclusive.
Everywhere, shells were dropping, and they could hear the shots from the
fighting get closer and closer. Nobody could see them, because they were behind
a little hill that the oak tree had grown around, so when a part of the front
line broke and one of the machine pistol bandits ran around it and saw them, all
three of them were surprised.

There was a moment where they all just looked at each other. Gil, holding Kas,
and the bandit. They just stared for a moment. The bandit clearly saw that they
were unarmed, and the state that Kas was in, and he looked less like a horrible
enemy and more like a human being for a moment. Gil couldn't see his eyes, but
he thought the bandit might have hesitated for a moment before opening fire.

Gil turned his back to the bandit and shielded Kas from the attack, and the
bandit started firing from afar. They looked at each other for the split second
this was happening with the look that two people in love give each other before
they're about to die. Gil screamed involuntarily as the bullets riddled his
body.

Suddenly, they heard a choking noise, and the assault stopped. Gil struggled to
turn over, and saw the empath had buried his sword in the bandit's back. The
bandit fell to the ground, and his machine pistol clattered next to him. The
empath looked horrified, and dropped the sword as the bandit fell. He looked at
Gil and Kas.

""Gil... Kas..."" he sputtered.

""Go. Leave us and get everyone hiding in the storehouse and in the farm, and
hide in the mountain base. Leave the turrets up,"" Gil managed to gasp out.

""But, Gil, you're going to...""

""Go. We and the guards aren't fighting out here for nothing.""

The empath gave Gil a significant look. It's the kind of look that Gil thought
would keep him up at night, if he had more time. The empath picked up the
machine pistol and threw it over to the duo, and sprinted back. Gil saw him
successfully ford the river.

Gil turned to Kas, and they looked into each other's eyes. Kas' were watery.
From pain or from emotion, he didn't know.

""I'm sorry about all this, love...""

Kas just looked at him, and smiled. ""If it's going to happen here, and now, it's
better that we're together, at least.""

Gil looked at her, sadly. ""We could've had more. More time. For god's sake, Kas,
we're only 30-""

""But we didn't. We probably don't have more time. I know I don't. I'm just glad
we made the best of the time we had together.""

He paused.

""Remember Redbeard?,"" he said, after a moment.

She smiled. ""Of course I do. That mutt was unforgettable.""

""Remember when every morning, when we just got here, he'd go out and hunt a
squirrel or something? He practically fed himself.""

""Yeah. He was the weirdest warg I've ever met. He was way too cuddly to be a
mindless killing machine like he was supposed to be. He'd always watch TV with
us.""

They both chuckled. A few shells fell near them. Gil looked over and saw that
the bandit, who hadn't quite died, had radioed in their position.

""Doin' all of us a favor,"" the bandit said.

Gil took the machine pistol up and shot him with what was left in the clip.

""Well, I suppose he probably wanted to die alone anyways,"" Kas said. ""It's the
pirate lifestyle. No time to enjoy anything, just loot, loot, loot...""

Gil just looked out at the river. He saw that 4 guards were fording the water,
again, fleeing back into the fortress. A large group of bandits followed them,
firing at them and at the auto-turrets.

""Think they'll be okay?,"" he asked.

Kas mulled the question over for longer than he was comfortable with. ""I think
so. That mountain fortress was really, really secure. I just hope they're able
to call the tribe.""

A shell caught the opposite side of the hill they were hiding behind, and the
explosion showered them with dirt. They looked at each other; understanding was
in their eyes.

""So it's time, huh?,"" Kas said.

""We never had enough time, Kas. We never had enough time.""

Kas just put a finger to his lips. Her eyes shined brilliantly. His, darker than
hers, simmered.

Thunk. A shell fell near them, but not as near as the one before.

They just looked at each other.

""I love you,"" Gil said.

""I love you too,"" Kas said. She breathed shallowly.

Thunk. Thunk.

They were both keenly aware of just how inadequate language is at expressing
love. There was never enough time to show it. Not now, and probably not ever.

They embraced, and kissed.

A shell fell directly onto where they were sitting. Their bodies were vaporized
instantly, and the flames consumed whatever was left. Their ashes drifted into
the sky, and mingled with the ashes of the burning walls of Breinigsville; the
ashes of what might have been.

Never enough time.

Never.

"[Stories] Sacking of Breinigsville: A Rimworld Short Story[EDIT]: I don't want to self-advertise, but I can't figure out how to make this look nicer. If you want a (slightly) better format, you can read it here: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~benjamse/writings/rimworld_storytelling.txt

I


Once, I had two pawns named Kasumi and Gil. They lived in a colony called
Breinigsville. Breinigsville was the rare kind of colony where two people could
get away from the constant struggle for survival for awhile, and relax. It was a
large village, for a rimworld -- 15 people lived there altogether -- and most
things there were provided for them. There was never a shortage of food or nice
clothing for anyone, and any issues were rectified by paying one of the nearby
friendly tribes to send a caravan of goods to trade for the fine art that made
the colony famous.


Kasumi and Gil were soulmates. While they hadn't settled down and actually
gotten married yet, (after all, there are other things to worry about on the
Rim!) they were clearly and undoubtedly in love. They did everything together:
they went on walks, hewed art out of rocks in the same workshop, and they even
hunted together. Their schedules were synchronized, from the moment they woke up
in the morning to the moment they went to bed in their modest cabin. It was
separated by some distance from the block of houses that everyone else lived in;
they liked their privacy.


Kasumi was abrasive, and had ice water running through her veins instead of
blood. She was a crack shot with a sniper rifle, once downing a charging Thrumbo
with a headshot after it had injured or killed everyone else that tried to hunt
it. She was always the first one out to try to stop a bandit siege, picking off
the gunners of the giant mortar guns before they could even finish constructing
them. When not throwing herself headlong into situations that could only be
survived by a sniper of her caliber, she remained detached from most of the
others in the colony, except for Gil. She spent most of her days outside the
walls of the compound, hunting.

Gil, on the other hand, was a socialite. He was Breinigsville's main warden and
trader, which made him one of the more valuable members of the town. He was
friends with everyone, and spent much of his time training the others in how to
snatch a good deal or undercut the opposition without them noticing. Once, he
was able to save the colony after a brutal winter by selling one statuette for
an entire spring's worth of food; he then later bought back the same statuette
for half the cost. When in combat, he abhorred guns, preferring to get right up
close to the enemy with an enormous steel longsword.

They were perfect for each other, and despite Kasumi's reclusiveness, they were
both well-respected in the community. Most of the people who lived through the
tougher parts of the colony's history can recall tales of these two
singlehandedly saving it.

Breinigsville was the kind of place that could've probably survived without
their intervention, most of the time. There was a central compound where the
kitchens, storehouses, and artists worked, a set of individual houses where
everyone lived, a huge tract of farmland growing everything from rice to
healroot, and a massive geothermal generator and redundant power system
supporting it all. Surrounding all of this was a thick outer wall that had
repelled many bandit attacks before, and the only way to get to the town was
through a large bunker filled with auto-turrets.

These defenses had held out against many attacks in the 6 years since
Breinigsville had been founded. Even the massively powerful mechanoid robots
were repeatedly unable to breach its defenses. The only thing that had worried
the guard of the place had been the bandit sieges with their large, powerful
mortar guns.

Still, Breinigsville had always held against even the most determined assaults,
which is why when a 25-person bandit siege dropped in across the river, they
weren't really worried. Kasumi, as usual with her, immediately turned on the
matrix of auto-turrets and went out with her sniper rifle. Gil stayed behind
with the squad of defenders in the bunker.


II

Kasumi got within range of the bandits. They were haughtily building a perimeter
of sandbags and mortar guns, laughing and scheming about what they were going to
do with the riches looted from the famed vaults of Breinigsville, deep in the
mountain.

""Fuckers,"" she muttered to herself, laying down prone inside a nook in the
mountain wall. She extended the bipod on her sniper rifle and settled down to
wait. You always had to take out the mortar gunners, or else they'd shell the
defenses to the town as they attacked it.

She felt a tinge of uneasiness. There were a lot more bandits in this group than
usual. Breinigsville usually had about 7 or 8 competent troops to defend it, and
bandits usually attacked with about double that. With the thick defensive
perimeter the colonists fought behind, battles like this were usually a breeze.
They hadn't lost anyone for a year.

Yet, she was uncertain that she'd be able to kill them all this time. She
counted 6 gunners, and this time they also had snipers of their own. With the
right timing, and her silencer, she thought she might be able to take out 2 or 3
of them before they spotted her and returned fire.

Still, she wasn't about to withdraw. She was across the river from the colony,
which straddled one side of the steep banks. A huge mountain range stretched for
miles on either side of her, and she looked down across a vast plain towards the
valley where the bandits were set up. It was spring, so everything shined with a
scintillating green color. They'd have very little cover if they charged her, so
she'd probably be able to clap a few more of them before she needed to flee
across the bridge again. She had a long sprint to it, but she was confident that
she'd be able to make it if she timed it right.

She could see the colony engineers placing and activating more auto-turrets
outside of the bunker. It seemed like they'd realized how many of the bandits
there were, too.

She radioed in. ""Bre, do you copy?""

A staticky voice came through, which she recognized immediately as Gil's.

""Yeah, Kas, we're here. There's a lot of those shitheads out there, huh?""

""Yeah,"" Kas replied, ""and they have long-range, too.""

""Fuck."" He sounded worried. ""They're in the valley, so they won't be able to
fire on you if you run back now.""

""I can't do that, Gil. They have six mortars.""

He swore at that, again.

""Pull back. We can hide in the mountain, and fight them indoors where the
mortars can't hit us.""

""Gil,"" she said, snapping at him, ""we're outnumbered. The only way we can beat
these guys is with the auto-turrets, and you can't move them from the bunker in
time. Plus, I don't want the town to go up in flames while we cower in a cave. I
have to stay here.""

He sighed. ""Just... just be careful, alright? I can't go out there and help you
-- not with those snipers around.""

""I promise. This isn't any different than last year's siege.""

""I hope so,"" he replied. ""Out, for now."" The radio crackled, and then went
silent.

Her soulmate assuaged, for now, she turned her attention back to the bandit
camp. They wandered lazily around like they had all the time in the world,
building up sandbags around their big mortar guns. She looked for an opportunity
to clap one without anyone noticing, but they were all grouped in clumps of 3 or
4 as they constructed. There was one that looked like she was the leader,
ordering people around, but it was a pretty loose operation, overall; typical of
the pirate raids in this area of the rimworld. Some of them were run like
efficient militias, complete with actual army training and everything, but many
of them were just rabble with guns, under loose leadership.

She turned her scope up, slightly, and saw a streak of fire in the sky. She
lifted her head and saw a couple of drop pods barreling down, landing amongst
the mortars. The doors on each of them, primed with a small explosive, popped
off. Smoke from the landing obscured her view, and she went back to her scope to
try to see what the bandit home base had just dropped on them.

She saw a shadow of a figure through the thick smoke, and what looked like a
crate. As it began clearing, she saw that the crates held the shells for the
mortars. It looked like 200, maybe 300 shells, enough to bring a large chunk of
the mountain down on their heads if they let them fire them all.

She radioed in. One of the lead empaths -- diplomats who were not allowed to
harm anyone -- answered. When she told him the number of shells they had, she
could almost hear him blanch. He told her she had the go-ahead to fire.

Steadying herself, she looked through her scope again. She saw four of the
bandits clustered around one of the crates, having trouble opening it. One of
them fetched a crowbar, popped the lid off, and lifted one of the
coppery-looking shells in the air. Kas spotted a flaming symbol on the side of
the canister, indicative of a high-explosive round. Filled with chemfuel, they
would start a fire after they rained down on the town. The defenses wouldn't
stand a chance.

She held her breath and fired a round right into the shell the bandit was
holding. The shell exploding triggered its brethren in the crate, and the
shockwave tossed the rest of the attackers like rag dolls, slamming them into
the mountain walls and the mortar guns. The bandit that was holding the shell
was vaporized immediately, and his friends didn't fare much better. They
screamed in agony as the flaming chemfuel enveloped them, and one of them jumped
into the river and passed out from the pain. Later on, his catatonic body would
become food for the wolves.

Kas smiled. The fuckers deserved it.

One of the mortar guns melted in the inferno. A tree caught fire, and from there
the forest began to go up in flames. During the confusion, Kas managed to kill
two more of the bandits. She popped up and down, hiding behind a rock to avoid
the sights of the bandit snipers that had set up behind the sandbags. They
sweeped over the mountain passes, looking for any attackers as the rest of them
tried to put out the flames and apply some triage to their concussed friends.

She counted four gunners left. She popped out of cover, and aimed for one's
head.

In the five years she and Gil had been a members of Breinigsville, Kas had never
gotten injured. Not once. She had grown up as a member of an urbworld gang, so
she was no stranger to pain, or gunshot wounds, but as a colonist she was always
fairly removed from the action. The worst thing that had ever happened to her
was a 3-month stint with gut worms, which is why it was so surprising to her
when she was shot.

Initially, she didn't know what had happened. She was thrown back and hit her
head on the stone ceiling of the nook she was in. She sat there stunned for a
moment. Her vision was red. Then, the senses came back to her. She was dimly
aware of a throbbing, blisteringly hot pain coming from her left shoulder, and a
strong headache where she hit the back of her helmet on the cave ceiling. She
undid the strap to it and struggled to get it off; the dent was painfully
pressing in on the back of her head. Her short, brown hair glistened with slick
blood.

Another shot rang out, striking the entrance to the cave. Kas scrambled back
behind her rock, dragging her rifle with her. She had dropped it when she flew
back, but it looked to be in good shape. She radioed into the colony.

""Bre, Bre, come in. I've been clapped. Repeat, I've been clapped. I need help!""

Gil came on the com. ""Kas! Where are you hit? I'll send a party out right awa-""

She cut him off. ""Shoulder, Gil. I can still shoot. But I need someone to go out
and secure the other side of the mountain face. I can't get out of cover while
there's a sniper out there.""

She heard him speak unintelligibly to another one of the guards. ""Will they be
safe?""

""Yeah, just stay along the wall so he won't see you coming.""

Gil barked an order to one of the guards. ""They're on their way, just stay
tight. Out.""

Kas breathed in and held it. She couldn't do much while she was sitting there,
so she closed her eyes and focused on the pain. The bullet hadn't gone through
the back side of her armor vest, and was stopping much of the bleeding. Her
vision swam, and she did a small battle meditation that she learned in her time
as a convent child on her urbworld. Control the pain, they said. You can still
fight.

""Mi ne estas en doloro,"" she chanted, softly, in the ancient language of her
urbworld. I am not in pain.

It subsided, a little bit, and she bandaged the wound with her field medical
kit. She shifted to the side, and barely poked her scope around the edge of the
rock to see what was going on. It obscured her view of the bandit camp, but she
could see the smoke and ash rising from the burning forest. There was less
screaming, now, so presumably all of the bandits had gotten away from the
danger.

Through the scope, she scanned the mountain face. She could see two of the
colony's guards running around the edge of the mountain face, trying to stay out
of the sight of any of the snipers. They probably wouldn't be able to see them,
as the snipers were in a valley, but she was higher up. She cursed the fact she
hadn't moved after her first shot.

Suddenly, she spotted her attacker, and barked out a laugh. The sound made the
pain come back twofold, and she winced. The sniper that shot her was hidden out
behind two giant chunks of granite left behind from the colony's mining
operations in the area. She'd always pestered the miners about not leaving shit
like that behind, because the enemy could use it as cover, but they'd always
waved her off like she was crazy. When she got back to camp, she thought, she'd
give them the comeuppance they deserved.

The sniper was on the radio, scanning the mountain face for any signs of Kas'
movements. Apparently, he hadn't seen her surreptitiously look right at him. He
wasn't paying attention to the path behind him, either. The two guards, both
armed with pump shotguns, grinned when they spotted him. They snuck up behind
him and positioned themselves so he'd have no escape.

They both pumped their shotguns at the same time, and the sniper spun around at
the noise. He managed a ""No, ple-"" before the guards pumped him full of lead. He
was barely recognizable after they finished with him; they slinked back to the
bunker the same way they came.

Kas popped out from cover. One of the gunners was standing by the river, calling
for the one that fell in when the fires began. She shot him in the torso, and he
followed his friend into the river, dying instantly. Three to go. The rest of
the bandit camp didn't even realize he was gone, as they were dealing with the
chemfuel leakages. The snipers moved up out of the valley and spread out,
looking for her. She had to go.

Kas radioed in again. ""Good work, boys,"" she singsonged. Gil replied.

""We've got readings of the long-range moving up,"" he said. ""You'd better get out
of there. How many guns are left?""

She got up, carefully. She could walk, her shoulder just hurt like hell. ""Three.
But I need to go. I'm sorry, Gil, I couldn't get them a-""

""Stop. It's fine. That's half of the gunners down, Kas, which is way better than
nothing. We can wait out the rest.""

She smiled, a little. ""I'm leaving, I'll meet you back at the nest. Out."" The
radio went silent.

She pitched her helmet on the rock, in full view of the snipers, and slunk out
the front of the nook. She ran quickly and easily, despite carrying her full
armored vest and gun with her, on an injured shoulder. She made good progress
down the mountainside, stopping at the base of it for a moment to survey the
situation.

She had a sprint across an open field. To her right, the bandit camp and forest
burned. She couldn't see any snipers, but she knew they were probably prone in
the grass. Behind her, going on in either direction for miles, was the mountain
range. She looked up at the nook she had been in, and could see the helmet was
already gone. They probably didn't fall for it, but it didn't hurt to shoot it
anyways.

In front of her, the field and river stretched parallel to the mountains. The
bridge looked to be some distance off, but she was lined up with it. It would be
a straight shot. Breinigsville's bunker laid on the other side. She could see
auto-turrets tracking slowly around, looking for a target, like stationary
mechanical guard dogs.

She heard a soft thunk, and a few seconds later, the first shell hit in the
river. Two more followed, each striking the water near the bridge.

Kas muttered to herself. ""Either they're terrible aims, or...""

The realization struck her. ""Shit. Shit. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. They're
aiming for the fucking bridge!""

Her radio buzzed, and Gil's voice crackled in all of its panicked timbre.

""Kas, you have to stay put. They're trying to smoke the bridge. If you get stuck
in that field, Kas-""

""It won't be much better being stuck here, Gil,"" she said grimly. ""I have to
go.""

""Kas, please. Just stay put. We can fight this fight in the field.""

""We need the auto-turrets, Gil. We have to have them. We'll lose if you come out
here.""

""Kas-""

She silenced the radio. She couldn't have him talking to her when she tried to
make this run.

There was another thunking noise, and three more shells rained down on the
bridge. They were getting closer. She knew she had to cross the field, now.

She started running. She ran as low to the ground as she could without losing
speed, but she knew that she was screwed if a sniper saw her and was able to
lead her with a bullet. Still, she was confident in her abilities. She'd never
been clapped before now, not severely. She ducked behind trees, took advantage
of all of the cover she could, and even ran behind a herd of elk. More shells
rained down on the bridge, but they couldn't seem to hit it. None of the ones
that hit the water exploded, but the chemfuel from the shells leaked and rose to
form a greasy film on top of the river. Kas could already see fish floating to
the surface. If no other damage occurred, they'd still probably have a hard
winter. They needed that river for food and water.

As she got closer, she felt a little haughty about her victory. Look at what
she'd done! And while they were going to have to wait out the mortar shells, she
was confident they'd not be able to fire them all before the colonists could
call one of the tribes for help. Everything was going to be alright, and she was
the one that stopped the raid, yet again. It was a good feeling. And she'd be
able to see Gil, and go home and sleep in their house after the day was done,
and maybe they'd cook together or just watch some TV, and look, there's Gil in
the bunker across the bridge, and I'm almost there -- oh, how he's going to fret
and worry about me when I get back, and tell me I should let one of the guys go
out and do my job next time, as if they could do it as well as I could, and-

A shell finally hit the bridge. She was 10, maybe 15 feet away from it. It
exploded, and the bridge instantly collapsed under the hellfire. The smoldering
pieces ignited the chemfuel in the water as they fell into the river, and the
conflagration spread instantly down the river a ways towards the bandit camp.
Gil screamed from the bunker.

The monolithic explosion threw Kas back, straight into a tree. She felt a rib or
two snap under the pressure, and her metal vest dented inwards painfully.
Flaming chemfuel from the explosion doused her, and her flesh seared. She
struggled to get her vest off, but the dent made it almost impossible. The heat
was unbearable. She screamed as the metal melted into her skin and dug into her
broken torso. Parts of her hair smoldered, and the overly-blackened parts of
her began to slough off. Her bandages burnt off, and she passed out from the
pain, slumped against a tree that itself began to burn in consort with her.

Gil couldn't see Kas, but he knew how close she was to the explosion. Readings
from their bunker console indicated that the bandits had started their assault.
Shells rained down on the town, igniting the food store and burning a part of
their winter crop. The smoke carried their dreams of a peaceful Breinigsville
into the sky from which they once came, when the founders crash landed their
escape pods into the river.

Gil knew they couldn't just sit there. The power supply could be shelled, the
geothermal generator, destroyed. And then where would they be? The auto-turrets
didn't have batteries. None of the town did, because they led to instability in
the power grid. They couldn't just hide in the mountain, they were outnumbered
and outgunned. They'd have to sortie into the field and fight them there. Yeah,
and then they could get Kas and bring her back and see how bad it is-

Gil stopped himself. He knew none of that was true. The power supply would hold,
and the mountain fortress was impregnable. But Kas...!

He looked around desperately at his men. The soldiers saw it in his eyes, and
nodded. They respected him, and respected Kas, too much not to do it.

They left the bunker, and started fording the river upstream from where it was
burning.

Gil didn't have a plan. He just wanted to get Kas out from wherever she was. He
knew that once they got across, they'd have to set up a defensive perimeter, but
he couldn't think straight when Kas was in danger. He told the empath that much,
and he nodded. He would direct the defenses. Gil could see the bandits, some
with shotguns, some with machine pistols, and others with rocket launchers
barreling down towards the colony. The troops spread out and started to fire at
them.

Gil stayed slightly behind and cast around frantically, looking for his other
half. The smoke from the burning forest choked him and made his eyes water. He
couldn't see anything, but he had to act fast, before the bodies from the
fighting started falling near him and confusing him in his search-

He saw a burning oak and a slumped over figure, and he knew. The sounds of the
vicious fighting quieted to a dull background roar as he approached her. He
thought he heard a scream as someone got shot, but he didn't pay very much
attention to it.

Kas was in bad shape. Her hair was singed, and her arms and legs were badly
burnt. They shined with a brilliant black hue. Her face was remarkably still
relatively okay, and her armor was only partially melted onto her. The burning
had stopped as the chemfuel was used up. Next to her was a hunk of metal that,
after a moment, he recognized to be what remained of her sniper rifle. She must
have held onto it as she was blown backwards.

Gil dropped his longsword and fell to his knees. He crawled towards her and
cradled her face. Her eyes fluttered open.

""G...Gil,"" she croaked out. ""Gil. I'm so sorry. I was stupid out there.""

""It's okay, Kas. We're going to get you out of here.""

""We...?"" Comprehension dawned in her eyes. Her hearing came back to her, and she
heard the shells falling on the guards, and the forest burning.

""You brought them out here, Gil.""

""I couldn't leave you here, Kas. Not like this.""

She normally would've been angry. A leader should look after his men, regardless
of his personal feelings on the matter. But she knew they had agreed to it. Of
course they did. And, above all, she just felt happy to see him again, one last
time.

He sat down next to her. A shell hit close by, which jolted them out of their
brief reverie.

""The fighting is getting closer..."" Gil said.

""I can't move,"" said Kas. ""I can't move.""

""No, Kas, you have to, we have to go-""

""Gil. I can't feel anything."" Her nerves were burnt.

Gil cursed. Kas lifted what remained of her hand, stiffly, and touched his face.

""You aren't going to leave if I tell you to, will you, Gil? Even to save
yourself?""

""Never,"" he replied.

She scoffed. The movement made her body scream with agony.

They sat for awhile, listening to the fighting. It sounded inconclusive.
Everywhere, shells were dropping, and they could hear the shots from the
fighting get closer and closer. Nobody could see them, because they were behind
a little hill that the oak tree had grown around, so when a part of the front
line broke and one of the machine pistol bandits ran around it and saw them, all
three of them were surprised.

There was a moment where they all just looked at each other. Gil, holding Kas,
and the bandit. They just stared for a moment. The bandit clearly saw that they
were unarmed, and the state that Kas was in, and he looked less like a horrible
enemy and more like a human being for a moment. Gil couldn't see his eyes, but
he thought the bandit might have hesitated for a moment before opening fire.

Gil turned his back to the bandit and shielded Kas from the attack, and the
bandit started firing from afar. They looked at each other for the split second
this was happening with the look that two people in love give each other before
they're about to die. Gil screamed involuntarily as the bullets riddled his
body.

Suddenly, they heard a choking noise, and the assault stopped. Gil struggled to
turn over, and saw the empath had buried his sword in the bandit's back. The
bandit fell to the ground, and his machine pistol clattered next to him. The
empath looked horrified, and dropped the sword as the bandit fell. He looked at
Gil and Kas.

""Gil... Kas..."" he sputtered.

""Go. Leave us and get everyone hiding in the storehouse and in the farm, and
hide in the mountain base. Leave the turrets up,"" Gil managed to gasp out.

""But, Gil, you're going to...""

""Go. We and the guards aren't fighting out here for nothing.""

The empath gave Gil a significant look. It's the kind of look that Gil thought
would keep him up at night, if he had more time. The empath picked up the
machine pistol and threw it over to the duo, and sprinted back. Gil saw him
successfully ford the river.

Gil turned to Kas, and they looked into each other's eyes. Kas' were watery.
From pain or from emotion, he didn't know.

""I'm sorry about all this, love...""

Kas just looked at him, and smiled. ""If it's going to happen here, and now, it's
better that we're together, at least.""

Gil looked at her, sadly. ""We could've had more. More time. For god's sake, Kas,
we're only 30-""

""But we didn't. We probably don't have more time. I know I don't. I'm just glad
we made the best of the time we had together.""

He paused.

""Remember Redbeard?,"" he said, after a moment.

She smiled. ""Of course I do. That mutt was unforgettable.""

""Remember when every morning, when we just got here, he'd go out and hunt a
squirrel or something? He practically fed himself.""

""Yeah. He was the weirdest warg I've ever met. He was way too cuddly to be a
mindless killing machine like he was supposed to be. He'd always watch TV with
us.""

They both chuckled. A few shells fell near them. Gil looked over and saw that
the bandit, who hadn't quite died, had radioed in their position.

""Doin' all of us a favor,"" the bandit said.

Gil took the machine pistol up and shot him with what was left in the clip.

""Well, I suppose he probably wanted to die alone anyways,"" Kas said. ""It's the
pirate lifestyle. No time to enjoy anything, just loot, loot, loot...""

Gil just looked out at the river. He saw that 4 guards were fording the water,
again, fleeing back into the fortress. A large group of bandits followed them,
firing at them and at the auto-turrets.

""Think they'll be okay?,"" he asked.

Kas mulled the question over for longer than he was comfortable with. ""I think
so. That mountain fortress was really, really secure. I just hope they're able
to call the tribe.""

A shell caught the opposite side of the hill they were hiding behind, and the
explosion showered them with dirt. They looked at each other; understanding was
in their eyes.

""So it's time, huh?,"" Kas said.

""We never had enough time, Kas. We never had enough time.""

Kas just put a finger to his lips. Her eyes shined brilliantly. His, darker than
hers, simmered.

Thunk. A shell fell near them, but not as near as the one before.

They just looked at each other.

""I love you,"" Gil said.

""I love you too,"" Kas said. She breathed shallowly.

Thunk. Thunk.

They were both keenly aware of just how inadequate language is at expressing
love. There was never enough time to show it. Not now, and probably not ever.

They embraced, and kissed.

A shell fell directly onto where they were sitting. Their bodies were vaporized
instantly, and the flames consumed whatever was left. Their ashes drifted into
the sky, and mingled with the ashes of the burning walls of Breinigsville; the
ashes of what might have been.

Never enough time.

Never.

"Questions for my Unemployment issueSo I'm still new to this game. No DLC. I have 6 colonies.

Here's what I do knw to help. Adding districts gives housing/jobs/etc. Resettle option basically put unemployed to other colonies with open jobs. Upgrading buildings help. 

I knw to resettle but my other colonies are in the same position. No jobs, some unemployed workers. As you can see I've maxed the districts and the building slots. So many questions, so many idntknws. Some 

Question 1 - is my building composition just bad/wrong here? 0.o  
  
Question 2 - what are the options to help mitigate some of this throughout my empire ? 

Question 3 -Should I stop building Mechanoids(robots) to halt population from being unemployed? (Robots are usually the unemployed one on my colonies.) 

   Question 4 - How do I knw which jobs are specialists and just normal worker jobs ? I mean if i go into the pop tab then it'll obviously tell me. But are there any indication somewhere telling me which is a normal working/specialist job when I'm selecting which buildings to plop down?

Please wait till after to ask for help
"Improvements to game/slice of life suggestions, discussion and critique friendly1. A better way of assigning jobs and work orders, like: If Alpaca in pen >10 slaughter alpaca until = 10, or: If Eclipse = True then sun lamp = on. Simple stuff like that so we dont have to wait for the pawns to do it themselves, whats that mean you ask? Well thats the next thing.
2. Programable AND/OR gates/simple (non mechanoid) robotics, a research path after microelectronics that allows for the construction of simple robots, i.e. Auto harvester that collects crops or a cart that hauls crap. Think of them like smart cars for hauling n stuff and the grabber hands or auto docs from fallout ofc they'd have to be nerfed a bit but i could see it working.
3. More prosthetics, so everyone knows that losing even one digit in this game can be a bad thing, instead of cutting off someones foot cause they have a missing toe we had the ability to install a wooden toe instead i propose a prosthetic for every damagable part in the game i.e. Noses, fingers, ears, eyes (glass eyes) etc. etc., on top of that the ability to pick the material used in installation of primitive prosthetics i.e. Gold, steel, jade. In order to not only increase its durability but also increase mood from having a pretty prosthetic.
4. Treatment of bad traits through ethical and unethical treatment, pyromania is bad those who have it might end up burning down your base, mental breaks and catatonic moods can be just as bad! I propose treatment such as therapy and counseling be added to help treat these things before they get really bad, but also the quicker treatments like electroshock therapy and lobotomy if need be. That way you keep your good burning passion miner but he stops getting xp, loses the ability to social and basically becomes a brain dead drone that only mines all day.
5. More art and artistic expression. Ok this one is kinda ripped from dwarf fortress but do you guys know how dwarves can carve walls with art and history or tables etc? I propose the ability for pawns to be able to carve furniture to make it prettier and increase its value plus who wouldn't want to sit at a table engraved with a picture of someone getting brutalised?
6. Biome bleed, What i mean by this is that when two biomes meet, instead of it being one or the other its a lil of both i.e. When you settle at a border like one biomes bleeding into the other, like if its a tropical forest and a temperate one you'd see a scattering of both biomes trees, animals and plants.
7. Optional narration of events done by a in Morgan Freeman sounding dude in the style of a David Attenborough documentary with a beginning cutscene/slideshow that is just as corny as it sounds.
8. Tynan Sylvester himself as an AI storyteller.
9. Voice acting for AI storytellers for whatever they decide to use this for
10. Canon Backstory for AI storytellers cause makes me happy
11. Lore in general
12. A Book Series based on the game and a bestiary and lorebook for people like me who like reading about every little piece of lore from what is Randy's affiliation to the rimworld, was he a pirate, does he like pineapple pizza, did he survive a rimworld, is the game trying to say the storytellers are former colonists from our settlement retelling their escapades? Y'know lore.

Anyways, if theres anything you think i could improve in this list to make it less incomprehensible then leave a comment to let me know. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

I


Once, I had two pawns named Kasumi and Gil. They lived in a colony called
Breinigsville. Breinigsville was the rare kind of colony where two people could
get away from the constant struggle for survival for awhile, and relax. It was a
large village, for a rimworld -- 15 people lived there altogether -- and most
things there were provided for them. There was never a shortage of food or nice
clothing for anyone, and any issues were rectified by paying one of the nearby
friendly tribes to send a caravan of goods to trade for the fine art that made
the colony famous.


Kasumi and Gil were soulmates. While they hadn't settled down and actually
gotten married yet, (after all, there are other things to worry about on the
Rim!) they were clearly and undoubtedly in love. They did everything together:
they went on walks, hewed art out of rocks in the same workshop, and they even
hunted together. Their schedules were synchronized, from the moment they woke up
in the morning to the moment they went to bed in their modest cabin. It was
separated by some distance from the block of houses that everyone else lived in;
they liked their privacy.


Kasumi was abrasive, and had ice water running through her veins instead of
blood. She was a crack shot with a sniper rifle, once downing a charging Thrumbo
with a headshot after it had injured or killed everyone else that tried to hunt
it. She was always the first one out to try to stop a bandit siege, picking off
the gunners of the giant mortar guns before they could even finish constructing
them. When not throwing herself headlong into situations that could only be
survived by a sniper of her caliber, she remained detached from most of the
others in the colony, except for Gil. She spent most of her days outside the
walls of the compound, hunting.

Gil, on the other hand, was a socialite. He was Breinigsville's main warden and
trader, which made him one of the more valuable members of the town. He was
friends with everyone, and spent much of his time training the others in how to
snatch a good deal or undercut the opposition without them noticing. Once, he
was able to save the colony after a brutal winter by selling one statuette for
an entire spring's worth of food; he then later bought back the same statuette
for half the cost. When in combat, he abhorred guns, preferring to get right up
close to the enemy with an enormous steel longsword.

They were perfect for each other, and despite Kasumi's reclusiveness, they were
both well-respected in the community. Most of the people who lived through the
tougher parts of the colony's history can recall tales of these two
singlehandedly saving it.

Breinigsville was the kind of place that could've probably survived without
their intervention, most of the time. There was a central compound where the
kitchens, storehouses, and artists worked, a set of individual houses where
everyone lived, a huge tract of farmland growing everything from rice to
healroot, and a massive geothermal generator and redundant power system
supporting it all. Surrounding all of this was a thick outer wall that had
repelled many bandit attacks before, and the only way to get to the town was
through a large bunker filled with auto-turrets.

These defenses had held out against many attacks in the 6 years since
Breinigsville had been founded. Even the massively powerful mechanoid robots
were repeatedly unable to breach its defenses. The only thing that had worried
the guard of the place had been the bandit sieges with their large, powerful
mortar guns.

Still, Breinigsville had always held against even the most determined assaults,
which is why when a 25-person bandit siege dropped in across the river, they
weren't really worried. Kasumi, as usual with her, immediately turned on the
matrix of auto-turrets and went out with her sniper rifle. Gil stayed behind
with the squad of defenders in the bunker.


II

Kasumi got within range of the bandits. They were haughtily building a perimeter
of sandbags and mortar guns, laughing and scheming about what they were going to
do with the riches looted from the famed vaults of Breinigsville, deep in the
mountain.

""Fuckers,"" she muttered to herself, laying down prone inside a nook in the
mountain wall. She extended the bipod on her sniper rifle and settled down to
wait. You always had to take out the mortar gunners, or else they'd shell the
defenses to the town as they attacked it.

She felt a tinge of uneasiness. There were a lot more bandits in this group than
usual. Breinigsville usually had about 7 or 8 competent troops to defend it, and
bandits usually attacked with about double that. With the thick defensive
perimeter the colonists fought behind, battles like this were usually a breeze.
They hadn't lost anyone for a year.

Yet, she was uncertain that she'd be able to kill them all this time. She
counted 6 gunners, and this time they also had snipers of their own. With the
right timing, and her silencer, she thought she might be able to take out 2 or 3
of them before they spotted her and returned fire.

Still, she wasn't about to withdraw. She was across the river from the colony,
which straddled one side of the steep banks. A huge mountain range stretched for
miles on either side of her, and she looked down across a vast plain towards the
valley where the bandits were set up. It was spring, so everything shined with a
scintillating green color. They'd have very little cover if they charged her, so
she'd probably be able to clap a few more of them before she needed to flee
across the bridge again. She had a long sprint to it, but she was confident that
she'd be able to make it if she timed it right.

She could see the colony engineers placing and activating more auto-turrets
outside of the bunker. It seemed like they'd realized how many of the bandits
there were, too.

She radioed in. ""Bre, do you copy?""

A staticky voice came through, which she recognized immediately as Gil's.

""Yeah, Kas, we're here. There's a lot of those shitheads out there, huh?""

""Yeah,"" Kas replied, ""and they have long-range, too.""

""Fuck."" He sounded worried. ""They're in the valley, so they won't be able to
fire on you if you run back now.""

""I can't do that, Gil. They have six mortars.""

He swore at that, again.

""Pull back. We can hide in the mountain, and fight them indoors where the
mortars can't hit us.""

""Gil,"" she said, snapping at him, ""we're outnumbered. The only way we can beat
these guys is with the auto-turrets, and you can't move them from the bunker in
time. Plus, I don't want the town to go up in flames while we cower in a cave. I
have to stay here.""

He sighed. ""Just... just be careful, alright? I can't go out there and help you
-- not with those snipers around.""

""I promise. This isn't any different than last year's siege.""

""I hope so,"" he replied. ""Out, for now."" The radio crackled, and then went
silent.

Her soulmate assuaged, for now, she turned her attention back to the bandit
camp. They wandered lazily around like they had all the time in the world,
building up sandbags around their big mortar guns. She looked for an opportunity
to clap one without anyone noticing, but they were all grouped in clumps of 3 or
4 as they constructed. There was one that looked like she was the leader,
ordering people around, but it was a pretty loose operation, overall; typical of
the pirate raids in this area of the rimworld. Some of them were run like
efficient militias, complete with actual army training and everything, but many
of them were just rabble with guns, under loose leadership.

She turned her scope up, slightly, and saw a streak of fire in the sky. She
lifted her head and saw a couple of drop pods barreling down, landing amongst
the mortars. The doors on each of them, primed with a small explosive, popped
off. Smoke from the landing obscured her view, and she went back to her scope to
try to see what the bandit home base had just dropped on them.

She saw a shadow of a figure through the thick smoke, and what looked like a
crate. As it began clearing, she saw that the crates held the shells for the
mortars. It looked like 200, maybe 300 shells, enough to bring a large chunk of
the mountain down on their heads if they let them fire them all.

She radioed in. One of the lead empaths -- diplomats who were not allowed to
harm anyone -- answered. When she told him the number of shells they had, she
could almost hear him blanch. He told her she had the go-ahead to fire.

Steadying herself, she looked through her scope again. She saw four of the
bandits clustered around one of the crates, having trouble opening it. One of
them fetched a crowbar, popped the lid off, and lifted one of the
coppery-looking shells in the air. Kas spotted a flaming symbol on the side of
the canister, indicative of a high-explosive round. Filled with chemfuel, they
would start a fire after they rained down on the town. The defenses wouldn't
stand a chance.

She held her breath and fired a round right into the shell the bandit was
holding. The shell exploding triggered its brethren in the crate, and the
shockwave tossed the rest of the attackers like rag dolls, slamming them into
the mountain walls and the mortar guns. The bandit that was holding the shell
was vaporized immediately, and his friends didn't fare much better. They
screamed in agony as the flaming chemfuel enveloped them, and one of them jumped
into the river and passed out from the pain. Later on, his catatonic body would
become food for the wolves.

Kas smiled. The fuckers deserved it.

One of the mortar guns melted in the inferno. A tree caught fire, and from there
the forest began to go up in flames. During the confusion, Kas managed to kill
two more of the bandits. She popped up and down, hiding behind a rock to avoid
the sights of the bandit snipers that had set up behind the sandbags. They
sweeped over the mountain passes, looking for any attackers as the rest of them
tried to put out the flames and apply some triage to their concussed friends.

She counted four gunners left. She popped out of cover, and aimed for one's
head.

In the five years she and Gil had been a members of Breinigsville, Kas had never
gotten injured. Not once. She had grown up as a member of an urbworld gang, so
she was no stranger to pain, or gunshot wounds, but as a colonist she was always
fairly removed from the action. The worst thing that had ever happened to her
was a 3-month stint with gut worms, which is why it was so surprising to her
when she was shot.

Initially, she didn't know what had happened. She was thrown back and hit her
head on the stone ceiling of the nook she was in. She sat there stunned for a
moment. Her vision was red. Then, the senses came back to her. She was dimly
aware of a throbbing, blisteringly hot pain coming from her left shoulder, and a
strong headache where she hit the back of her helmet on the cave ceiling. She
undid the strap to it and struggled to get it off; the dent was painfully
pressing in on the back of her head. Her short, brown hair glistened with slick
blood.

Another shot rang out, striking the entrance to the cave. Kas scrambled back
behind her rock, dragging her rifle with her. She had dropped it when she flew
back, but it looked to be in good shape. She radioed into the colony.

""Bre, Bre, come in. I've been clapped. Repeat, I've been clapped. I need help!""

Gil came on the com. ""Kas! Where are you hit? I'll send a party out right awa-""

She cut him off. ""Shoulder, Gil. I can still shoot. But I need someone to go out
and secure the other side of the mountain face. I can't get out of cover while
there's a sniper out there.""

She heard him speak unintelligibly to another one of the guards. ""Will they be
safe?""

""Yeah, just stay along the wall so he won't see you coming.""

Gil barked an order to one of the guards. ""They're on their way, just stay
tight. Out.""

Kas breathed in and held it. She couldn't do much while she was sitting there,
so she closed her eyes and focused on the pain. The bullet hadn't gone through
the back side of her armor vest, and was stopping much of the bleeding. Her
vision swam, and she did a small battle meditation that she learned in her time
as a convent child on her urbworld. Control the pain, they said. You can still
fight.

""Mi ne estas en doloro,"" she chanted, softly, in the ancient language of her
urbworld. I am not in pain.

It subsided, a little bit, and she bandaged the wound with her field medical
kit. She shifted to the side, and barely poked her scope around the edge of the
rock to see what was going on. It obscured her view of the bandit camp, but she
could see the smoke and ash rising from the burning forest. There was less
screaming, now, so presumably all of the bandits had gotten away from the
danger.

Through the scope, she scanned the mountain face. She could see two of the
colony's guards running around the edge of the mountain face, trying to stay out
of the sight of any of the snipers. They probably wouldn't be able to see them,
as the snipers were in a valley, but she was higher up. She cursed the fact she
hadn't moved after her first shot.

Suddenly, she spotted her attacker, and barked out a laugh. The sound made the
pain come back twofold, and she winced. The sniper that shot her was hidden out
behind two giant chunks of granite left behind from the colony's mining
operations in the area. She'd always pestered the miners about not leaving shit
like that behind, because the enemy could use it as cover, but they'd always
waved her off like she was crazy. When she got back to camp, she thought, she'd
give them the comeuppance they deserved.

The sniper was on the radio, scanning the mountain face for any signs of Kas'
movements. Apparently, he hadn't seen her surreptitiously look right at him. He
wasn't paying attention to the path behind him, either. The two guards, both
armed with pump shotguns, grinned when they spotted him. They snuck up behind
him and positioned themselves so he'd have no escape.

They both pumped their shotguns at the same time, and the sniper spun around at
the noise. He managed a ""No, ple-"" before the guards pumped him full of lead. He
was barely recognizable after they finished with him; they slinked back to the
bunker the same way they came.

Kas popped out from cover. One of the gunners was standing by the river, calling
for the one that fell in when the fires began. She shot him in the torso, and he
followed his friend into the river, dying instantly. Three to go. The rest of
the bandit camp didn't even realize he was gone, as they were dealing with the
chemfuel leakages. The snipers moved up out of the valley and spread out,
looking for her. She had to go.

Kas radioed in again. ""Good work, boys,"" she singsonged. Gil replied.

""We've got readings of the long-range moving up,"" he said. ""You'd better get out
of there. How many guns are left?""

She got up, carefully. She could walk, her shoulder just hurt like hell. ""Three.
But I need to go. I'm sorry, Gil, I couldn't get them a-""

""Stop. It's fine. That's half of the gunners down, Kas, which is way better than
nothing. We can wait out the rest.""

She smiled, a little. ""I'm leaving, I'll meet you back at the nest. Out."" The
radio went silent.

She pitched her helmet on the rock, in full view of the snipers, and slunk out
the front of the nook. She ran quickly and easily, despite carrying her full
armored vest and gun with her, on an injured shoulder. She made good progress
down the mountainside, stopping at the base of it for a moment to survey the
situation.

She had a sprint across an open field. To her right, the bandit camp and forest
burned. She couldn't see any snipers, but she knew they were probably prone in
the grass. Behind her, going on in either direction for miles, was the mountain
range. She looked up at the nook she had been in, and could see the helmet was
already gone. They probably didn't fall for it, but it didn't hurt to shoot it
anyways.

In front of her, the field and river stretched parallel to the mountains. The
bridge looked to be some distance off, but she was lined up with it. It would be
a straight shot. Breinigsville's bunker laid on the other side. She could see
auto-turrets tracking slowly around, looking for a target, like stationary
mechanical guard dogs.

She heard a soft thunk, and a few seconds later, the first shell hit in the
river. Two more followed, each striking the water near the bridge.

Kas muttered to herself. ""Either they're terrible aims, or...""

The realization struck her. ""Shit. Shit. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. They're
aiming for the fucking bridge!""

Her radio buzzed, and Gil's voice crackled in all of its panicked timbre.

""Kas, you have to stay put. They're trying to smoke the bridge. If you get stuck
in that field, Kas-""

""It won't be much better being stuck here, Gil,"" she said grimly. ""I have to
go.""

""Kas, please. Just stay put. We can fight this fight in the field.""

""We need the auto-turrets, Gil. We have to have them. We'll lose if you come out
here.""

""Kas-""

She silenced the radio. She couldn't have him talking to her when she tried to
make this run.

There was another thunking noise, and three more shells rained down on the
bridge. They were getting closer. She knew she had to cross the field, now.

She started running. She ran as low to the ground as she could without losing
speed, but she knew that she was screwed if a sniper saw her and was able to
lead her with a bullet. Still, she was confident in her abilities. She'd never
been clapped before now, not severely. She ducked behind trees, took advantage
of all of the cover she could, and even ran behind a herd of elk. More shells
rained down on the bridge, but they couldn't seem to hit it. None of the ones
that hit the water exploded, but the chemfuel from the shells leaked and rose to
form a greasy film on top of the river. Kas could already see fish floating to
the surface. If no other damage occurred, they'd still probably have a hard
winter. They needed that river for food and water.

As she got closer, she felt a little haughty about her victory. Look at what
she'd done! And while they were going to have to wait out the mortar shells, she
was confident they'd not be able to fire them all before the colonists could
call one of the tribes for help. Everything was going to be alright, and she was
the one that stopped the raid, yet again. It was a good feeling. And she'd be
able to see Gil, and go home and sleep in their house after the day was done,
and maybe they'd cook together or just watch some TV, and look, there's Gil in
the bunker across the bridge, and I'm almost there -- oh, how he's going to fret
and worry about me when I get back, and tell me I should let one of the guys go
out and do my job next time, as if they could do it as well as I could, and-

A shell finally hit the bridge. She was 10, maybe 15 feet away from it. It
exploded, and the bridge instantly collapsed under the hellfire. The smoldering
pieces ignited the chemfuel in the water as they fell into the river, and the
conflagration spread instantly down the river a ways towards the bandit camp.
Gil screamed from the bunker.

The monolithic explosion threw Kas back, straight into a tree. She felt a rib or
two snap under the pressure, and her metal vest dented inwards painfully.
Flaming chemfuel from the explosion doused her, and her flesh seared. She
struggled to get her vest off, but the dent made it almost impossible. The heat
was unbearable. She screamed as the metal melted into her skin and dug into her
broken torso. Parts of her hair smoldered, and the overly-blackened parts of
her began to slough off. Her bandages burnt off, and she passed out from the
pain, slumped against a tree that itself began to burn in consort with her.

Gil couldn't see Kas, but he knew how close she was to the explosion. Readings
from their bunker console indicated that the bandits had started their assault.
Shells rained down on the town, igniting the food store and burning a part of
their winter crop. The smoke carried their dreams of a peaceful Breinigsville
into the sky from which they once came, when the founders crash landed their
escape pods into the river.

Gil knew they couldn't just sit there. The power supply could be shelled, the
geothermal generator, destroyed. And then where would they be? The auto-turrets
didn't have batteries. None of the town did, because they led to instability in
the power grid. They couldn't just hide in the mountain, they were outnumbered
and outgunned. They'd have to sortie into the field and fight them there. Yeah,
and then they could get Kas and bring her back and see how bad it is-

Gil stopped himself. He knew none of that was true. The power supply would hold,
and the mountain fortress was impregnable. But Kas...!

He looked around desperately at his men. The soldiers saw it in his eyes, and
nodded. They respected him, and respected Kas, too much not to do it.

They left the bunker, and started fording the river upstream from where it was
burning.

Gil didn't have a plan. He just wanted to get Kas out from wherever she was. He
knew that once they got across, they'd have to set up a defensive perimeter, but
he couldn't think straight when Kas was in danger. He told the empath that much,
and he nodded. He would direct the defenses. Gil could see the bandits, some
with shotguns, some with machine pistols, and others with rocket launchers
barreling down towards the colony. The troops spread out and started to fire at
them.

Gil stayed slightly behind and cast around frantically, looking for his other
half. The smoke from the burning forest choked him and made his eyes water. He
couldn't see anything, but he had to act fast, before the bodies from the
fighting started falling near him and confusing him in his search-

He saw a burning oak and a slumped over figure, and he knew. The sounds of the
vicious fighting quieted to a dull background roar as he approached her. He
thought he heard a scream as someone got shot, but he didn't pay very much
attention to it.

Kas was in bad shape. Her hair was singed, and her arms and legs were badly
burnt. They shined with a brilliant black hue. Her face was remarkably still
relatively okay, and her armor was only partially melted onto her. The burning
had stopped as the chemfuel was used up. Next to her was a hunk of metal that,
after a moment, he recognized to be what remained of her sniper rifle. She must
have held onto it as she was blown backwards.

Gil dropped his longsword and fell to his knees. He crawled towards her and
cradled her face. Her eyes fluttered open.

""G...Gil,"" she croaked out. ""Gil. I'm so sorry. I was stupid out there.""

""It's okay, Kas. We're going to get you out of here.""

""We...?"" Comprehension dawned in her eyes. Her hearing came back to her, and she
heard the shells falling on the guards, and the forest burning.

""You brought them out here, Gil.""

""I couldn't leave you here, Kas. Not like this.""

She normally would've been angry. A leader should look after his men, regardless
of his personal feelings on the matter. But she knew they had agreed to it. Of
course they did. And, above all, she just felt happy to see him again, one last
time.

He sat down next to her. A shell hit close by, which jolted them out of their
brief reverie.

""The fighting is getting closer..."" Gil said.

""I can't move,"" said Kas. ""I can't move.""

""No, Kas, you have to, we have to go-""

""Gil. I can't feel anything."" Her nerves were burnt.

Gil cursed. Kas lifted what remained of her hand, stiffly, and touched his face.

""You aren't going to leave if I tell you to, will you, Gil? Even to save
yourself?""

""Never,"" he replied.

She scoffed. The movement made her body scream with agony.

They sat for awhile, listening to the fighting. It sounded inconclusive.
Everywhere, shells were dropping, and they could hear the shots from the
fighting get closer and closer. Nobody could see them, because they were behind
a little hill that the oak tree had grown around, so when a part of the front
line broke and one of the machine pistol bandits ran around it and saw them, all
three of them were surprised.

There was a moment where they all just looked at each other. Gil, holding Kas,
and the bandit. They just stared for a moment. The bandit clearly saw that they
were unarmed, and the state that Kas was in, and he looked less like a horrible
enemy and more like a human being for a moment. Gil couldn't see his eyes, but
he thought the bandit might have hesitated for a moment before opening fire.

Gil turned his back to the bandit and shielded Kas from the attack, and the
bandit started firing from afar. They looked at each other for the split second
this was happening with the look that two people in love give each other before
they're about to die. Gil screamed involuntarily as the bullets riddled his
body.

Suddenly, they heard a choking noise, and the assault stopped. Gil struggled to
turn over, and saw the empath had buried his sword in the bandit's back. The
bandit fell to the ground, and his machine pistol clattered next to him. The
empath looked horrified, and dropped the sword as the bandit fell. He looked at
Gil and Kas.

""Gil... Kas..."" he sputtered.

""Go. Leave us and get everyone hiding in the storehouse and in the farm, and
hide in the mountain base. Leave the turrets up,"" Gil managed to gasp out.

""But, Gil, you're going to...""

""Go. We and the guards aren't fighting out here for nothing.""

The empath gave Gil a significant look. It's the kind of look that Gil thought
would keep him up at night, if he had more time. The empath picked up the
machine pistol and threw it over to the duo, and sprinted back. Gil saw him
successfully ford the river.

Gil turned to Kas, and they looked into each other's eyes. Kas' were watery.
From pain or from emotion, he didn't know.

""I'm sorry about all this, love...""

Kas just looked at him, and smiled. ""If it's going to happen here, and now, it's
better that we're together, at least.""

Gil looked at her, sadly. ""We could've had more. More time. For god's sake, Kas,
we're only 30-""

""But we didn't. We probably don't have more time. I know I don't. I'm just glad
we made the best of the time we had together.""

He paused.

""Remember Redbeard?,"" he said, after a moment.

She smiled. ""Of course I do. That mutt was unforgettable.""

""Remember when every morning, when we just got here, he'd go out and hunt a
squirrel or something? He practically fed himself.""

""Yeah. He was the weirdest warg I've ever met. He was way too cuddly to be a
mindless killing machine like he was supposed to be. He'd always watch TV with
us.""

They both chuckled. A few shells fell near them. Gil looked over and saw that
the bandit, who hadn't quite died, had radioed in their position.

""Doin' all of us a favor,"" the bandit said.

Gil took the machine pistol up and shot him with what was left in the clip.

""Well, I suppose he probably wanted to die alone anyways,"" Kas said. ""It's the
pirate lifestyle. No time to enjoy anything, just loot, loot, loot...""

Gil just looked out at the river. He saw that 4 guards were fording the water,
again, fleeing back into the fortress. A large group of bandits followed them,
firing at them and at the auto-turrets.

""Think they'll be okay?,"" he asked.

Kas mulled the question over for longer than he was comfortable with. ""I think
so. That mountain fortress was really, really secure. I just hope they're able
to call the tribe.""

A shell caught the opposite side of the hill they were hiding behind, and the
explosion showered them with dirt. They looked at each other; understanding was
in their eyes.

""So it's time, huh?,"" Kas said.

""We never had enough time, Kas. We never had enough time.""

Kas just put a finger to his lips. Her eyes shined brilliantly. His, darker than
hers, simmered.

Thunk. A shell fell near them, but not as near as the one before.

They just looked at each other.

""I love you,"" Gil said.

""I love you too,"" Kas said. She breathed shallowly.

Thunk. Thunk.

They were both keenly aware of just how inadequate language is at expressing
love. There was never enough time to show it. Not now, and probably not ever.

They embraced, and kissed.

A shell fell directly onto where they were sitting. Their bodies were vaporized
instantly, and the flames consumed whatever was left. Their ashes drifted into
the sky, and mingled with the ashes of the burning walls of Breinigsville; the
ashes of what might have been.

Never enough time.

Never.
