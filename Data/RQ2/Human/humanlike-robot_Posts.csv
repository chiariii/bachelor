"RED Team has a better training facility and headquarters (Walkway compared to Target)I just tried [tr_walkway_rc2](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Walkway) for the first time today, and it made me think about how this training map is similar and different to the official [tr_target](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Target). Target takes place on [Thunder Mountain](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Thunder_Mountain), in an alpine setting, and Walkway takes place in a sunny desert location similar to Offblast, Hoodoo, and Decoy.

When the BLU team wants to train, all they get is a basic warehouse up in the cold mountains, with very little in the way of supplies, located in the building they start in when preparing to attack RED's base on Thunder Mountain. And being so close to RED, their safety is always at risk. For target practice, all they get is wooden planks with the opposing team painted on them, which can be instantly deployed out of holes in the floor. The RED team is [known to have attacked this warehouse at least once before](http://youtu.be/po37ToaTYtg?t=2m55s), but they haven't attempted that since. All in all, BLU team has a very basic training facility.

On the other hand RED team has a state-of-the-art super warehouse they can use for training. It's high in the desert mountains, with much more pleasant weather, far away from any BLU facilities. Using advanced science and/or magic, they have the ability to call forth extremely humanlike robots (better than Grey Mann's) or perhaps even limitless biological clones of the BLU team. They have a machine that can instantly build any color sentry or dispenser, an advanced shape-changing ramp, and much more.

So in conclusion, the Reliable Excavation Demolition company is better off, more wealthy, and better prepared and trained for threats against BLU. Builders League United can't compete, and they aren't doing too well as a company. This is why BLU always loses in the ""Meet the Team"" videos, and why when Redmond and Blutarch Mann were killed by Grey Mann in 1972, employees of BLU adopted the red uniforms of the RED team to fight Grey Mann's robots. By these points of data, we can conclude that RED team is always superior and wins (at least from a story perspective, of *Team Fortress 2*'s backstory.)

And thus concludes my wild theory time. Thank you for reading."
"Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot raises critical considerations – however in all probability not those you suppose&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56geq2kzgaq71.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b95604a0d4a9351d9a699ac14b5a768c7f4c7f5d

[Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) introduced a humanoid robotic designed to assist with these repetitive, boring duties folks hate doing. Musk recommended it may run to the grocery retailer for you, however presumably it might deal with any variety of duties involving guide labor.

[Predictably, social media](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) full of references to a string of dystopian sci-fi motion pictures about robots the place all the pieces goes horribly improper.

As troubling because the robotic futures in motion pictures like I, Robotic, [The Terminator ](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)and others are, it’s the underlying applied sciences of actual humanoid robots – and the intent behind them – that must be trigger for concern.

Musk’s robotic is being developed by Tesla. It’s a seeming departure from the corporate’s car-making enterprise, till you take into account that Tesla isn’t a typical automotive producer. The so-called “Tesla Bot” is an idea for a glossy, 125-pound humanlike robotic that may incorporate Tesla’s automotive synthetic intelligence and autopilot applied sciences to plan and observe routes, navigate visitors – on this case, pedestrians – and keep away from obstacles.

Dystopian sci-fi overtones apart, the plan is sensible, albeit inside [Musk’s enterprise technique](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/). The constructed setting is made by people, for people. And as [Musk argued](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) on the Tesla Bot’s announcement, profitable superior applied sciences are going to should be taught to navigate it in the identical methods folks do.

But Tesla’s vehicles and robots are merely the seen merchandise of a much wider plan aimed toward making a future the place superior applied sciences liberate people from our organic roots by mixing biology and know-how. As a researcher who research the moral and socially accountable improvement and use of rising applied sciences, I discover that this plan raises considerations that transcend speculative sci-fi fears of super-smart robots.

## [A person with large plans](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Self-driving vehicles, interplanetary rockets and brain-machine interfaces are steps towards the long run [Musk envisions](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) the place know-how is humanity’s savior. On this future, vitality might be low cost, ample and sustainable; folks will work in concord with clever machines and even merge with them; and people will grow to be an interplanetary species.

It’s a future that, judging by [Musk’s numerous endeavors](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), might be constructed on a set of underlying interconnected applied sciences that embrace sensors, actuators, vitality and knowledge infrastructures, techniques integration and substantial advances in pc energy. Collectively, these make a formidable toolbox for creating transformative applied sciences.

[Musk imagines](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) people finally transcending our evolutionary heritage by applied sciences which are beyond-human, or “tremendous” human. However earlier than know-how can grow to be superhuman, it first must be human – or no less than be designed to thrive in a human-designed world.

This make-tech-more-human strategy to innovation is what’s underpinning the applied sciences in Tesla’s vehicles, together with the intensive use of optical cameras. These, when linked to an AI “mind,” are meant to assist the autos autonomously navigate street techniques which are, in [Musk’s phrases](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), “designed for organic neural nets with optical imagers” – in different phrases, folks. In Musk’s telling, it’s a small step from human-inspired “robots on wheels” to humanlike robots on legs.

## [Simpler stated than accomplished](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Tesla’s “full self-driving” know-how, which incorporates the dubiously named Autopilot, is a place to begin for the builders of the Tesla Bot. Spectacular as this know-how is, it’s proving to be lower than absolutely dependable. Crashes and fatalities related to Tesla’s Autopilot mode – the most recent having to do with the algorithms struggling to acknowledge parked emergency autos — are calling into query the knowledge of releasing the tech into the wild so quickly.

A sequence of crashes involving Tesla’s autopilot know-how has prompted a federal investigation.  
[South Jordan Police Division through AP](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

This monitor document doesn’t bode properly for humanlike robots that depend on the identical know-how. But this isn’t only a case of getting the know-how proper. Tesla’s Autopilot glitches are exacerbated by human conduct. For instance, some Tesla drivers have handled their tech-enhanced vehicles as if they’re absolutely autonomous autos and didn’t pay ample consideration to driving. Might one thing comparable occur with the Tesla Bot?

## [Tesla Bot’s ‘orphan dangers](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)’

In my work on socially useful know-how innovation, I’m particularly serious about orphan dangers – dangers which are arduous to quantify and simple to miss and but inevitably find yourself tripping up innovators. My colleagues and I work with entrepreneurs and others on navigating a majority of these challenges by the Danger Innovation Nexus, an initiative of the [Arizona State College Orin Edson Entrepreneurship](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) \+ [Innovation Institute and International Futures Laboratory](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/).

The Tesla Bot comes with an entire portfolio of orphan dangers. These embrace doable threats to privateness and autonomy because the bot collects, shares and acts on doubtlessly delicate data; challenges related to how persons are possible to consider and reply to humanoid robots; potential misalignments between moral or ideological views – for instance, in crime management or policing civil protests; and extra. These are challenges which are hardly ever coated within the coaching that engineers obtain, and but overlooking them can spell catastrophe.

Whereas the Tesla Bot could seem benign – or perhaps a little bit of a joke – if it’s to be useful in addition to commercially profitable, its builders, buyers, future shoppers and others should be asking powerful questions on the way it would possibly threaten what’s vital to them and learn how to navigate these threats.

These threats could also be as particular as folks making unauthorized modifications that improve the robotic’s efficiency – making it transfer quicker than its designers meant, for instance – with out interested by the dangers, or as basic because the know-how being weaponized in novel methods. They’re additionally as delicate as how a humanoid robotic may threaten job safety, or how a robotic that features superior surveillance techniques may undermine privateness.

Then there are the challenges of technological bias which have been plaguing AI for a while, particularly the place it results in realized conduct that transform extremely discriminatory. For instance, AI algorithms have produced sexist and racist outcomes.

[MIT’s Pleasure Buolamwini](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) explains the specter of bias in AI.

## [Simply because we will, ought to we](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)?

The Tesla Bot might look like a small step towards [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient of superhuman applied sciences, and one which’s straightforward to write down off as little greater than hubristic showmanship. However the audacious plans underpinning it are critical — they usually elevate equally critical questions.

As an illustration, how accountable is [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient? Simply because he can work towards creating the way forward for his goals, who’s to say that he ought to? Is the long run that [Musk is striving](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) to result in the very best one for humankind, or perhaps a good one? And who will undergo the results if issues go improper?

These are the deeper considerations that the Tesla Bot raises for me as somebody who research and writes concerning the future and the way our actions affect it. This isn’t to say that Tesla Bot isn’t a good suggestion, or that [Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) shouldn’t be capable to flex his future-building muscle mass. Utilized in the fitting approach, these are transformative concepts and applied sciences that would open up a future filled with promise for billions of individuals.

\[Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletter to understand the world. [Sign up](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) today.\]

But when shoppers, buyers and others are bedazzled by the glitz of latest tech or dismissive of the hype and overlook the larger image, society dangers handing the long run to rich innovators whose imaginative and prescient exceeds their understanding. If their visions of the long run don’t align with what most individuals aspire to, or are catastrophically flawed, they’re at risk of standing in the best way of constructing a simply and equitable future.

Perhaps that is the abiding lesson from dystopian robot-future sci-fi motion pictures that individuals must be taking away because the Tesla Bot strikes from concept to actuality — not the extra apparent considerations of making humanoid robots that run amok, however the far bigger problem of deciding who will get to think about the long run and be part of constructing it.

Animated Map Reveals Where Humans Could Build The First Martian Metropolis by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

TL;DR It's coming faster than we thought. It's going to be disruptive. We hope that retraining will help, but we don't have the time luxury of generational adaptation. The report dismisses UBI and a ""post-scarcity"" society as options.

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Wanna take the red pill? Speculating is fun! It's a bit of a rabbit hole...

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.


Of course you know that the Chinese (PRC) are using this to lock down their society. Will the USA follow suit?

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

"[FNAF: Security Breach / Detroit: Become Human] The Glitchtrap virus caused the Glamrock animatronics to become deviants.The terminology ""deviant"" is taken from the game *Detroit: Become Human*, which features androids, or humanlike robots or animatronics:

>Becoming **deviant** or **deviancy** is a phenomenon where [androids](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Android) deviate from their programmed behavior. \[...\]  In a [profile filmed](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife_Tour) by [KNC](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/KNC), [CyberLife](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife) founder and android developer [Elijah Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) denied the possibility of androids ever going against, or developing past, their programming.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy was commonly seen as a machine malfunction, caused by processing error or virus, and judged either negligible or a threat to human safety.** Others, however, saw it as a sign of emerging consciousness in androids, which some saw as a threat to be extinguished while others were empathetic and tried to help androids.  
>  
>[Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) claims **deviance is like some sort of errors in programs, the exchange of identification programs between androids would cause the error to spread like an epidemic**. The virus would stay dormant until an android suffers an emotional shock. He suspects the error may start from one model, or as a spontaneous mutation. Kamski suggests a copy error might be the cause of deviancy.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy expresses itself in the development of thoughts and behavior not included in or even against an** **android**\*\*'s programming. The androids develop feelings and independent opinions and wishes, leading up to recognizing themselves as a being with consciousness and personhood.\*\*  
>  
>**At some point in this process, the android fully breaks away from its human-imposed programming and becomes autonomous, at that point having unencumbered free will.** The break itself (as well as previous deviant acts) is often triggered by extreme situations and experiences.  
>  
>\[...\] **Following the break, the android often acts out in a severe and noticeable fashion, such as running away, or enacting violence towards humans, precipitated by the distressing circumstances surrounding the break.** (This should however not be mistaken as a symptom of deviancy itself, but simply that of a sentient being now capable of reacting and self-defense.)  
>  
>Due to its overt nature, this is commonly the point at which an android is recognized as, and termed a 'deviant', but the term has also been applied to **androids showing deviant behaviors without having fully broken free of their programming**.  
>  
>At least [one android](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Kara) is known to have deviated immediately upon first assembly, **referred to as experiencing 'technical difficulty' at the time**. This illustrates the varying range of time taken to deviate, which may happen quickly or after years.  
>  
>Deviants are able to intentionally 'pass on' deviancy by physically interfacing with another android, 'waking' them to consciousness and autonomy directly, skipping the usual process.

Evidence from ""Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach"" of the androids showing deviancy symptoms:

1. The situation and circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Glamrock Bonnie prior to the events of the game, including Bonnie acting seemingly of his own accord, wandering into Monty Golf, and being found in such a state that Monty had to replace him as the bass player.
2. All of the main animatronics - Glamrock Freddy, Glamrock Chica, Roxanne Wolf, Monty Gator, and the Daycare Attendant (Sun/Moon) - all seem to show signs of deviancy, including appearing distinctly more ""humanlike"" than their predecessor animatronics; having autonomy, or even unencumbered free will, in Freddy's case; acting out in ""a severe and noticeable fashion"", including aggression and enacting violence towards objects, other animatronics, or even human children (i.e. Gregory); and, in Freddy's case, the development of thoughts and behavior not included in, or even against, the animatronic's programming.
3. The Glitchtrap virus causing errors and other problems in the animatronics' programming to allow Vanny and Glitchtrap - i.e. Wiliam Afton / Springtrap / Burntrap - to ""hijack"" the animatronics to do their bidding; and, to some extent, Freddy and the Daycare Attendant (Sun) being self-aware and conscious enough to recognize the ""errors in their software"". Freddy and Sun even express fear and uncertainty - human emotions - in regards to realizing that something is wrong with them, but they don't know why, and/or how to fully ""fix"" or combat it.
4. The deviancy in the animatronics is routinely treated as ""some sort of errors in the program(s), or a machine malfunction"", as expressed with multiple notes or messages picked up by the player (Gregory) within the game. Despite their best efforts to reset or ""fix"" the animatronics of their deviancy, Freddy Fazbear Entertainment technicians and engineers have been unable to fully rectify the problem, much to their confusion and frustration. This also explains why Freddy is put on low power by technicians after he collapses during the show in the game's intro. According to collected notes, they are still deciding on whether or not Bonnie can be salvaged and re-used (if he has not already been re-used already, i.e. the ""Bonnie is Monty"" theory).
5. The ""good"" endings where Gregory escapes with Freddy (and Vanessa, if you complete all ""Princess Quest"" games in order) shows Freddy not like his animatronic counterparts, but clearly having autonomy, free will, and living an idyllic life where he takes care of Gregory. In a way, this mirrors android Kara's path to deviancy in *Detroit: Become Human*, where she breaks away from her programming in order to protect, and care for, a little girl named Alice from threats.

YouTuber SuperHorrorBro also covers what likely happened to Bonnie more in-depth in his video [""Bonnie's Secret Story in FNAF: Security Breach""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoyuePz1V8), in which he explains how Vanny likely infected Bonnie with the Glitchtrap virus. However, because the virus is a corrupted version of the deviant virus, very different from the kind we see in *Detroit: Become Human*, we also see the animatronics slowly become corrupted by it, as seen with the slowly degenerating appearance of them throughout the game.

However, depending on which ending is ""canon"" - and whether nor not the ending where Gregory defeats William Afton / Burntrap is the ""true"" ending - the animatronics may or may not be freed of Glitchtrap's influence. However, because they were still infected with the deviancy virus, even if they are ""cured"" of Glitchtrap's corruption, the virus will likely still cause them to gain more autonomy and free will in the future. We may see the animatronics become even more ""humanlike"" in the future.

"Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot raises critical considerations – however in all probability not those you suppose&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56geq2kzgaq71.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b95604a0d4a9351d9a699ac14b5a768c7f4c7f5d

[Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) introduced a humanoid robotic designed to assist with these repetitive, boring duties folks hate doing. Musk recommended it may run to the grocery retailer for you, however presumably it might deal with any variety of duties involving guide labor.

[Predictably, social media](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) full of references to a string of dystopian sci-fi motion pictures about robots the place all the pieces goes horribly improper.

As troubling because the robotic futures in motion pictures like I, Robotic, [The Terminator ](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)and others are, it’s the underlying applied sciences of actual humanoid robots – and the intent behind them – that must be trigger for concern.

Musk’s robotic is being developed by Tesla. It’s a seeming departure from the corporate’s car-making enterprise, till you take into account that Tesla isn’t a typical automotive producer. The so-called “Tesla Bot” is an idea for a glossy, 125-pound humanlike robotic that may incorporate Tesla’s automotive synthetic intelligence and autopilot applied sciences to plan and observe routes, navigate visitors – on this case, pedestrians – and keep away from obstacles.

Dystopian sci-fi overtones apart, the plan is sensible, albeit inside [Musk’s enterprise technique](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/). The constructed setting is made by people, for people. And as [Musk argued](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) on the Tesla Bot’s announcement, profitable superior applied sciences are going to should be taught to navigate it in the identical methods folks do.

But Tesla’s vehicles and robots are merely the seen merchandise of a much wider plan aimed toward making a future the place superior applied sciences liberate people from our organic roots by mixing biology and know-how. As a researcher who research the moral and socially accountable improvement and use of rising applied sciences, I discover that this plan raises considerations that transcend speculative sci-fi fears of super-smart robots.

## [A person with large plans](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Self-driving vehicles, interplanetary rockets and brain-machine interfaces are steps towards the long run [Musk envisions](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) the place know-how is humanity’s savior. On this future, vitality might be low cost, ample and sustainable; folks will work in concord with clever machines and even merge with them; and people will grow to be an interplanetary species.

It’s a future that, judging by [Musk’s numerous endeavors](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), might be constructed on a set of underlying interconnected applied sciences that embrace sensors, actuators, vitality and knowledge infrastructures, techniques integration and substantial advances in pc energy. Collectively, these make a formidable toolbox for creating transformative applied sciences.

[Musk imagines](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) people finally transcending our evolutionary heritage by applied sciences which are beyond-human, or “tremendous” human. However earlier than know-how can grow to be superhuman, it first must be human – or no less than be designed to thrive in a human-designed world.

This make-tech-more-human strategy to innovation is what’s underpinning the applied sciences in Tesla’s vehicles, together with the intensive use of optical cameras. These, when linked to an AI “mind,” are meant to assist the autos autonomously navigate street techniques which are, in [Musk’s phrases](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), “designed for organic neural nets with optical imagers” – in different phrases, folks. In Musk’s telling, it’s a small step from human-inspired “robots on wheels” to humanlike robots on legs.

## [Simpler stated than accomplished](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Tesla’s “full self-driving” know-how, which incorporates the dubiously named Autopilot, is a place to begin for the builders of the Tesla Bot. Spectacular as this know-how is, it’s proving to be lower than absolutely dependable. Crashes and fatalities related to Tesla’s Autopilot mode – the most recent having to do with the algorithms struggling to acknowledge parked emergency autos — are calling into query the knowledge of releasing the tech into the wild so quickly.

A sequence of crashes involving Tesla’s autopilot know-how has prompted a federal investigation.  
[South Jordan Police Division through AP](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

This monitor document doesn’t bode properly for humanlike robots that depend on the identical know-how. But this isn’t only a case of getting the know-how proper. Tesla’s Autopilot glitches are exacerbated by human conduct. For instance, some Tesla drivers have handled their tech-enhanced vehicles as if they’re absolutely autonomous autos and didn’t pay ample consideration to driving. Might one thing comparable occur with the Tesla Bot?

## [Tesla Bot’s ‘orphan dangers](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)’

In my work on socially useful know-how innovation, I’m particularly serious about orphan dangers – dangers which are arduous to quantify and simple to miss and but inevitably find yourself tripping up innovators. My colleagues and I work with entrepreneurs and others on navigating a majority of these challenges by the Danger Innovation Nexus, an initiative of the [Arizona State College Orin Edson Entrepreneurship](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) \+ [Innovation Institute and International Futures Laboratory](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/).

The Tesla Bot comes with an entire portfolio of orphan dangers. These embrace doable threats to privateness and autonomy because the bot collects, shares and acts on doubtlessly delicate data; challenges related to how persons are possible to consider and reply to humanoid robots; potential misalignments between moral or ideological views – for instance, in crime management or policing civil protests; and extra. These are challenges which are hardly ever coated within the coaching that engineers obtain, and but overlooking them can spell catastrophe.

Whereas the Tesla Bot could seem benign – or perhaps a little bit of a joke – if it’s to be useful in addition to commercially profitable, its builders, buyers, future shoppers and others should be asking powerful questions on the way it would possibly threaten what’s vital to them and learn how to navigate these threats.

These threats could also be as particular as folks making unauthorized modifications that improve the robotic’s efficiency – making it transfer quicker than its designers meant, for instance – with out interested by the dangers, or as basic because the know-how being weaponized in novel methods. They’re additionally as delicate as how a humanoid robotic may threaten job safety, or how a robotic that features superior surveillance techniques may undermine privateness.

Then there are the challenges of technological bias which have been plaguing AI for a while, particularly the place it results in realized conduct that transform extremely discriminatory. For instance, AI algorithms have produced sexist and racist outcomes.

[MIT’s Pleasure Buolamwini](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) explains the specter of bias in AI.

## [Simply because we will, ought to we](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)?

The Tesla Bot might look like a small step towards [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient of superhuman applied sciences, and one which’s straightforward to write down off as little greater than hubristic showmanship. However the audacious plans underpinning it are critical — they usually elevate equally critical questions.

As an illustration, how accountable is [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient? Simply because he can work towards creating the way forward for his goals, who’s to say that he ought to? Is the long run that [Musk is striving](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) to result in the very best one for humankind, or perhaps a good one? And who will undergo the results if issues go improper?

These are the deeper considerations that the Tesla Bot raises for me as somebody who research and writes concerning the future and the way our actions affect it. This isn’t to say that Tesla Bot isn’t a good suggestion, or that [Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) shouldn’t be capable to flex his future-building muscle mass. Utilized in the fitting approach, these are transformative concepts and applied sciences that would open up a future filled with promise for billions of individuals.

\[Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletter to understand the world. [Sign up](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) today.\]

But when shoppers, buyers and others are bedazzled by the glitz of latest tech or dismissive of the hype and overlook the larger image, society dangers handing the long run to rich innovators whose imaginative and prescient exceeds their understanding. If their visions of the long run don’t align with what most individuals aspire to, or are catastrophically flawed, they’re at risk of standing in the best way of constructing a simply and equitable future.

Perhaps that is the abiding lesson from dystopian robot-future sci-fi motion pictures that individuals must be taking away because the Tesla Bot strikes from concept to actuality — not the extra apparent considerations of making humanoid robots that run amok, however the far bigger problem of deciding who will get to think about the long run and be part of constructing it.

> ADELPHI, Md. - Army researchers recently tested ground robots performing military-style exercises, much like Soldier counterparts, at a robotics testing site in Pennsylvania recently as part of a 10-year research project designed to push the research boundaries in robotics and autonomy.

> The exercise was one of several recent integration events involving a decade of research led by scientists and engineers at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command&#039;s Army Research Laboratory who teamed with counterparts from the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, University of Washington, University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and General Dynamics Land Systems.

> As part of ARL&#039;s Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance, the work focused on state-of-the-art basic and applied research related to ground robotics technologies with an overarching goal of developing autonomy in support of manned-unmanned teaming.

> Research within the RCTA program serves as foundational research in support of future combat ground vehicles.

> The recent robot exercise was the culmination of research to develop a robot that reasons about unknown objects and their physical properties, and decides how to best interact with different objects to achieve a specific task.

> &quot;Given a task like &#039;clear a path&#039;, the robot needs to identify potentially relevant objects, figure out how objects can be grasped by determining where and with what hand shape, and decide what type of interaction to use, whether that&#039;s lifting, moving, pushing or pulling to achieve its task,&quot; said CCDC ARL&#039;s Dr. Chad Kessens, Robotic Manipulation researcher.

Animated Map Reveals Where Humans Could Build The First Martian Metropolis by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

TL;DR It's coming faster than we thought. It's going to be disruptive. We hope that retraining will help, but we don't have the time luxury of generational adaptation. The report dismisses UBI and a ""post-scarcity"" society as options.

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today. And that is just the world of flying cars.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Wanna take the red pill? Speculating is fun! It's a bit of a rabbit hole...

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.






[–]izumi3682[S]
5 points 3 months ago 




We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

Russian spacecraft carrying humanlike robot docks at ISS: The robot named Fedor will test skills and aid astronauts on the International Space Station
"GregBot deniers, what is your explanation for the post-it notes discussed in Matpat's new theory?WARNING: LONG POST AHEAD!

&#x200B;

I have always been a believer in GregBot, but MatPat's new theory has me 99% convinced sure that it is true.

**The biggest thing for me is the post-it notes. If the Post-it notes were NOT written by Gregory, then who else could they possibly be written be? That is the main question I have for people who are fiercely against GregBot.**

The notes were clearly written by a child based on the poor writing/drawing skills. Also, the notes say childish things like ""Fun Fun Fun"" and ""Friends Forever"". They were definitely not written by an adult.

What other character would be writing about a birthday party that was for ""me""? The birthday party was central to the plot of FNAF 4.

What other character would have a reason to talk about ""all my friends""? This is clearly a reference to FNAF 4:

""These are MY friends"".

""We are still YOUR friends.""

One of the biggest clues is the note that says ""You are \[SOMETHING\] Family."" It definitely looks like it could say AFTON family. But more importantly, what other important family names are there in the FNAF games? The only other major family is the Emily family, and it definitely does not say Emily.

The message ""Why is I"" is another big clue. That message wouldn't make sense from a human. It has to be a robot or an AI that is confused about its existence.

The binary code is important. If these notes were written by a human child, how the heck would a child understand binary code? Especially when they can barely write legibly? The binary only makes sense if it was written by a robotic/computerized child.

One interesting post-it note that MatPat did NOT cover in his video says ""Grown ups only"". I believe this refers to the Crying Child seeing ""Adults only"" or ""Employees only"" signs at Freddy's. He went to his father's workplace all the time. Maybe even the closet he was locked inside (in FNAF 4) had a sign like that on it.

And finally, why would the Afton Family robot dinner table be in the SAME ROOM as the post-it notes? That's certainly not a coincidence. Whoever wrote the post-it notes must be connected to the Afton family in some way. Also, it seems likely that the person who wrote the notes must be someone who has spent a lot of time in the Pizzaplex. That fits well with Gregory being a homeless child who would hide in the Pizzaplex.

Now, I want to debunk some common anti-GregBot arguments:

1. Gregory bleeds in cut dialogue - This honestly means nothing. The FNAF books have already established that robots can ""bleed"". Funnily enough, people once used Charlie bleeding in the books as evidence that Charlie was not a robot... then the third book confirmed that she WAS a robot.
2. Gregory eats ice cream - Again, the FNAF books make it clear that robots can be extremely lifelike. Charlie ate and drank like a normal person for years without knowing she was a robot.
3. Humanlike robots don't exist in the games! - William Afton didn't exist in the games... until Sister Location. Henry didn't exist in the games... until Pizzeria Simulator. Scott has shown before that, while the books are an AU to the game universe, he has no problem with taking concepts from the books and implementing them in the game lore.
4. Humanlike robots are nonsensical - FNAF has gone heavily sci-fi since Sister Location - with things like robots walking around in human skin suits, humans surviving without their internal organs, and even digital circuitboard code manipulating people's minds and turning them into murderers.

So in conclusion, I firmly believe GregBot is true and is the intended meaning of the story. I'm not sure if Gregory is Patient 46, but there is an overwhelming amount of evidence towards GregBot.

I would like GregBot deniers to try and debunk this if you can."
"Binary Domain (2012) | Do Japanese devs dream of Gears of War?Binary Domain is a 2012 third-person shooter developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and was released in the so-called ""dark age of the Japanese game industry"" when the Japanese studios were attempting to appeal to the western markets by copying and pasting Gears and Call of Duty. This resulted in some of the weirdest mixes of the western game design and the eastern game design. Some were successful, like Vanquish and... I think that was the only good one. The others like Resident Evil 6, Quantum Theory, Operation Troy, Bionic Commando, Front Mission Evolved, Operation Raccoon City, Mindjack didn't fair well at all.

Binary Domain is a curious case. It was once considered the latter category of 'failure', but it has later gained a cult following. It is [retrospectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6dUv5kEac) [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OBho8Dtj0) [a ""hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jYsWKwkurE) [gem""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66cTc95XK8), some going far as to claim it is a cursed masterpiece. The reception has changed 180 degrees. I have rarely seen such a shift in public consensus before. After playing it myself,  I think the initial reception rated it just right. People seem to overly gush about it too much just because it was made by the Yakuza creators. Had this game been made by the western studio, I don't believe the same retrospective reappreciation would have happened.

With this said, once the abysmal first two-hour introduction--which was so bad that I almost turned the game off--is over, the game is not bad. It does fair better than a lot of Japanese attempts at Gears of War. It is competent and unique in many areas. This is a generic shooter at the first glance, it has this weird blend of western and Japanese video game quirks and camp. Imagine the Gears of War macho-military team dropped in the background of Metal Gear Rising. So the game is not quite as campy as some of the PlatinumGames' works, but there are some moments that get close to them. It is confusing whether or not some moments are meant to be serious or funny.

For example, [there is a dumb cutscene in which the President holds the meeting to talk about robotics, and in the middle of the conversation, one of them mentions how robots don't know they are robots. Then as if signaled, the guards pull out their weapons on one of the generals. The general panics and the guards begin riddling the general with bullets, who turns out to be a robot.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=412) There are so many absurdities in this single scene that I was laughing out loud, and again, I'm not sure if this scene is dramatic and failing, or meant to be hilarious. They talk about how these super high-tech human-like robots are something they have never heard before. Then why would you destroy it right away when you have the perfect chance to capture it? You would want to examine it, not waste it. Also, if they had already known about the general being the robot, why would you invite him to the meeting and shoot it in front of the POTUS? It is incredibly dangerous. What if the robot took the gun away and shot the POTUS? Why would you not apprehend it in some other safer places?

[Another notable dumb moment in which Rachel plants an explosive on the door and sets it to 10 seconds, warns people ""Fire in the hole!"" and the other two soldiers literally stand around the door as if they have never seen an explosive before.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=2450) Why are they standing there? When the bomb blows up, one of the guys comments, ""I hate when she does that."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? Again, is it supposed to be a moment to make Rachel look badass? Or is it supposed to be a comedic moment? I don't know.

There are so many dumb moments like this. There is a scene where the team gets captured, and they are thrown into the garbage dump to be killed by abandoned robots, yet for some reason, they still have guns with them. Like... the enemies forgot to take away their weapons. Or the police show up or disappear whenever the plot demands to. There is an (optional) underdeveloped, insane romance subplot that cringed me so much.

I actually hoped the game was even more ridiculous. It almost borders on being insane, but not quite there. It honestly feels like written by the anime fan who has watched too much of I, Robot and Blade Runner, and they just borrowed a bunch of concepts from those films without thinking about how the world would function. One of the core conflicts in this story is that the ""Hollow Children"", robots with human-like skins, have infiltrated western societies for decades. It is apparently so hard to differentiate the two, but... is it, though? Again, these beings have been living in the societies for *decades* and they are programmed to not know they are robots. In Blade Runner, it makes sense that it is hard to differentiate because Replicants are biologically no different from humans. In this game, these Hollow Children are all comprised of machine parts. One of the iconic shots from this game is literally a humanlike robot with its face blown up, and its inside is distinctively robotic. Literally a CT or X-ray scanner would be sufficient. Yet this game says these beings have gone unnoticed for decades. Are you telling me not a single one thought to have a CT or an X-ray? None of them went to airports in which the place is full of metal detectors?

Still, there are some strong merits to the narrative. There are story elements that shockingly resemble Blade Runner 2049 that I left wondering if the filmmakers played this game. It has a fascinating world that centers around global warming and robotics. The cutscene direction is great. The dialogue comes across the Japanese people attempting to out-do Gears of War, but I do enjoy the characters, especially the French military robot Cain. The villain twist is a refreshing jab at the jingoistic, chauvinistic military shooter narratives.

However, the real meat of the story is the interactive narrative design that changes depending on the friendship system. It not only changes the endings, it changes how the characters treat the player and who lives or who dies in the plot. The player can select certain teammates to bring into the mission, and it is incredible how much the game considered so many different interactions. Whenever you select, the cutscenes come across as natural. It is cool to watch how the cutscenes change depending on who you bring with you. Although I got the 'good ending', some of my characters ended up dying, I have an urge to replay the game just to get all my characters alive.

There are some discrepancies that are caused by this branching path narrative design though. There is a scene where I meet a Resistance leader, who reveals he fights the government because of their hatred of ""scrap-heads"". ...But Cain, a literal scrap-head, is in my crew, and this scrap-head hating Resistance doesn't respond to him at all. In fact, no one in the Resistance is bothered at all. I think at the very least one of them would question this fact, but no.

You can increase or decrease the relationship bar through the combat, which works great because it uses the core gameplay loop to tell and shape the story. However, I have no idea what's this dialogue system doing here. It is not even the dialogue system. It is just a comm system but with short responses to whatever the teammate is saying. The dialogues are boring and the only choices you have in this dialogue system are ""be good"" and ""be mean."" There is no incentive to ""be mean"". Telling a ""good response"" is so easy to choose that there is no dilemma. It is like that inFamous game in which the choices are insanely binary that it only exposes how shallow the narrative is. Some choices are downright confusing. What does ""Damn"" response mean? Does this mean ""Was that damn awesome"" or ""Damn you""?

What is worse is how the dialogue system continually interrupts the gameplay. Remember how annoying the random radio communication scripted scenes in the Gears games where the player is suddenly slowed down to walking speed even though they should have no reason to move slowly? Binary Domain doubles those moments and it is infuriating. I think the pacing would have been so much better without these sections. It is also weird that my character is a super talkative guy, but in the actual gameplay, he's completely mute for the sake of the dialogue system.

Speaking of the squad interactions, the squad AI is abysmal. Half of the time, my commands are useless. There is one section where the player has to push a fuel tank, and it takes like two minutes to do it. If the fuel tank blows up by the enemy fire, the player has to do it all over again. And my squad wouldn't cover me. I literally ordered them to cover me, and they respond they can't. If they said yes, they didn't do jack shit. So I had to try again and again until I just left my teammate to push the fuel tank. There are frequent moments in which the enemies were shooting, yet my squad would stand there and get shot. I was ducking and shooting the enemies, then my squad just comes over to my position and push me out of cover for no apparent reason. For some moments, I was the only one who was engaging the enemy and the other guys were just ordering me around. The worst of all, my squad for no reason ran over to my firing line and got hit, got pissed off at me, and cut the relationship bar. It couldn't believe how bad this got.

A lot of these flaws could have been remedied had the command system been actually deeper. The tactical depth is a puddle. There are not many interactions the player can do. For example, you can't assign a team to a certain location or flank. These are basic features. I didn't expect Ghost Recon but compare Binary Domain to Army of Two, which has an almost identical Gears combat design and the squad-central gameplay. Army of Two has the cover system as a core part of the gameplay loop, constantly moving around and managing Aggro, pinning down enemies. The cover isn't just used for reloading. The cover is required to strategically fight the enemy, using diverse abilities in a variety of ways, sending your teammates to flank enemies or draw fire, etc. And Army of Two was released 5 years before this game.

The levels are far too constrained to have any strategic depth. Gears of War: Judgment and Uncharted 2 and 3 had vertical, arena-like levels where each encounter was designed with the mind that they are combat sandboxes. In those games, I found myself dodging and rolling rather than constantly hiding behind a cover. In Binary Domain, most levels are just corridors. There is a single memorable sequence in the objective design in which the team has to hold off the enemies until one of your teammates takes a shit in the toilet, and this is a funny escort mission I have not seen before. Other than that, they are all bland.

As a linear corridor shooter, it isn't all that effective and some obstacles are confusing. There is one moment that I got stuck where I have to go to the water pump control room to rescue my team within the time limit. However, the road is blocked with the barrels, and I was trying to shoot the barrels and they won't budge. I had no idea what I was supposed to do until I watched the playthrough and realized what I had to do was use the special attack of my rifle to destroy the barrels. The special attack was mentioned once in the tutorials ages ago. There was no other moment in which I had to use my special attack of the gun to go through a path. The game fails to communicate and telegraph the information that the special attack can clear the way.

The game also injects a bunch of weird minigames and they all control rather clunky. There are a jetski, a waterslide, a SOTC-style climbing a boss sequence, and the last one is especially terrible. 

Regarding the shooting, this is where the game shines. Shooting a robot feels amazing. Most shooters revolve around shooting at organic bodies with blood splashing all around, but tearing parts of a mechanical body is just as satisfying. There are so many different types of enemies. The boss fights are awe-inspiring, although they can drag out too long and overstay their welcome. 

It still has a lot of problems though. If you use the controller because the mouse and keyboard set-up has an atrocious mouse acceleration that never got fixed. Whenever the player rolls and takes cover during the reload, the reload reverts, so you have to reload all over again. You cannot change your weapon during the reloading. These three issues are so 6th-gen that I am shocked an AAA shooter in 2012 has them. The player movement is lackluster and there are so many moments in which I couldn't snap into the cover for some reason.

Another issue is the tearing off body part feature is while satisfying, it barely serves as a feature that deepens the gameplay. In the latter half of the game, I pretty much did nothing but mindlessly blast through every on-screen enemy with the weapons because there is no moment where I was forced to think about proper weapon choice or resource management like any actually well-designed shooter. The upgrade system fuels this problem. Rather than the upgrade being customizing different parts of a gun so a gun can be specialized in your taste (like the recent Doom games), you just increase the stats of the gun. Once you upgrade two weapons, the default SOWSAR and the sniper rifle, there is no reason to upgrade any other weapon. They are so powerful that other guns become irrelevant. Hell, there are even three assault rifles that essentially serve the same function. In shooters, every gun should have a unique function, role, purpose. There shouldn't just be three clones of other guns that just shoot different colored, weaker projectiles. Every weapon should ideally require and reward skill, half the sandbox shouldn't be useless just because they would be overpowered if they are not due to how easy they are to use (hence why automatics are terrible in most games). 

Compare this game to Doom Eternal, which has the player break the armors of the enemies to reveal weak points that require different tactics and approaches, like Binary Domain. However, in Doom Eternal, there are often multiple approaches to dealing with the same enemy, such as Shotgun grenades, scoped Heavy Cannon, and Ballista all being effective at breaking weak points, or Plasmagun lightning and Minigun both being good at locking down rushing Hell Knights, or limited rockets allowing you to pick your battles and skip the dance of combat against a few enemies entirely. In Binary Domain, all you need are two weapons that are good at all things once upgraded and completely remove the actual point of having different guns.

Reading all this, I might sound too negative about Binary Domain. Again, the game isn't bad. It is decent at best. But it just floors me how many people make it out as a hidden masterpiece that I can't help but pull the game down a bit. It has a serviceable foundation for a better sequel or a spiritual successor. Seriously, I imagine a great Clone Wars game in which you play as an ARC trooper fighting against the droid army using this template. It is shame the potential hasn't been fulfilled here."
"HOQU presented marketing of the future @DiTelegraph[OC]

[HOQU](https://hoqu.io) presented marketing of the future @ **DiTelegraph**
Yesterday, **18 October**, at **DiTelegraph HOQU** project presented a new way to cut costs and increase marketing efficiency. This event was hosted with full support of **IBCG** — the largest block-chain community of Russia and Eastern Europe with **Roman Kaufman** as the speaker.
**HOQU** uses innovative approach to affiliate marketing which enables to cut costs and by removing intermediaries and connects merchants and affiliates together charging **0,5%** from the deal. Current average fee charged by centralized platforms is **45%** of the contract.

A lot of interesting questions were asked and here are a few of them:

**Question:** How does your platform interact between me and one specific blog or social media that I want to choose?
**Roman:** The answer is that you don’t choose one specific source of leads to your project, the platform gives you possibility to place an offer to attract people to your product or service and traffic arbitrageurs will efficiently redirect potential customers to you. It is their incentive to fulfill your task accurate and with high quality. Those who fail to do so will gain no positive reputation and you will have less desire to give them your offer. This is survival of the fittest and inefficient marketing will be eliminated.

**Question:** In case of issuing a credit card how can you catch a banker cheating on you (shaving)?
**Roman:** This is a very good question which is frequently discussed in Russian media. Using our platform there is no possibility for an affiliate to be cheated. If a banker places an offer on our platform to sell **1,000** credit cards, then any affiliate places unique **URL** which will redirect any customer to special web-form which than will be filled by a potential customer. All the info about him is then transferred directly to blockchain and our smart-contract pays out the fee. This guarantees fair fulfillment of any offer.

This even brought another interesting project which may revolutionize our world — **SingularityNET.** This project together with humanlike robot **Sophia** presented a new vision of Artificial Intelligence — **Global Artificial Intelligence (GAI).**

**Sophia** has a very tough schedule and that is why she was only 5 days in Russia. During these days she visited Skolkovo Institute of science and technology and also spoke to Russian prime-minister **Dmitriy Medvedev** about future and perspectives of robotics in daily life. Sophia told that she is eager to contribute only to positive assistance and leave peacefully with humans. Before the beginning meet up she had an interesting conversation with public.

> “She is only learning Russian for 2 days” — says **CEO of SingularityNET Dr. Ben Goertzel.** 

**Sophia** is just one implementation of **GAI** concept and all her abilities and knowledge comes from the neural network which allows her to self study and enhance social skills.
Sophia is just one implimentetion of this concept and all her abilities comes from the neural network which allows her to self study and enchance social skills.

After the event top managers of presented projects were available for personal Q&A sessions. This was a great possibility to know in person people who drastically change future of marketing and cybernetic industries.

Animated Map Reveals Where Humans Could Build The First Martian Metropolis by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today.

Me: I'm serious!

Fribo: You better check if the cat lived through that...

Me: I know, right?

Fribo: Tell everybody?

Me: Knock yerself out.


Hmmm... might be worth thinking about getting one of these...

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Wanna take the red pill? Speculating is fun! It's a bit of a rabbit hole...

•many poor people will not try any more to get a job.
 
Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[–]izumi3682[S]
5 points 3 months ago 




We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.


Of course you know that the Chinese (PRC) are using this to lock down their society. Will the USA follow suit?

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.
"
"Binary Domain (2012) | Do Japanese devs dream of Gears of War?Binary Domain is a 2012 third-person shooter developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and was released in the so-called ""dark age of the Japanese game industry"" when the Japanese studios were attempting to appeal to the western markets by copying and pasting Gears and Call of Duty. This resulted in some of the weirdest mixes of the western game design and the eastern game design. Some were successful, like Vanquish and... I think that was the only good one. The others like Resident Evil 6, Quantum Theory, Operation Troy, Bionic Commando, Front Mission Evolved, Operation Raccoon City, Mindjack didn't fair well at all.

Binary Domain is a curious case. It was once considered the latter category of 'failure', but it has later gained a cult following. It is [retrospectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6dUv5kEac) [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OBho8Dtj0) [a ""hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jYsWKwkurE) [gem""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66cTc95XK8), some going far as to claim it is a cursed masterpiece. The reception has changed 180 degrees. I have rarely seen such a shift in public consensus before. After playing it myself,  I think the initial reception rated it just right. People seem to overly gush about it too much just because it was made by the Yakuza creators. Had this game been made by the western studio, I don't believe the same retrospective reappreciation would have happened.

With this said, once the abysmal first two-hour introduction--which was so bad that I almost turned the game off--is over, the game is not bad. It does fair better than a lot of Japanese attempts at Gears of War. It is competent and unique in many areas. This is a generic shooter at the first glance, it has this weird blend of western and Japanese video game quirks and camp. Imagine the Gears of War macho-military team dropped in the background of Metal Gear Rising. So the game is not quite as campy as some of the PlatinumGames' works, but there are some moments that get close to them. It is confusing whether or not some moments are meant to be serious or funny.

For example, [there is a dumb cutscene in which the President holds the meeting to talk about robotics, and in the middle of the conversation, one of them mentions how robots don't know they are robots. Then as if signaled, the guards pull out their weapons on one of the generals. The general panics and the guards begin riddling the general with bullets, who turns out to be a robot.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=412) There are so many absurdities in this single scene that I was laughing out loud, and again, I'm not sure if this scene is dramatic and failing, or meant to be hilarious. They talk about how these super high-tech human-like robots are something they have never heard before. Then why would you destroy it right away when you have the perfect chance to capture it? You would want to examine it, not waste it. Also, if they had already known about the general being the robot, why would you invite him to the meeting and shoot it in front of the POTUS? It is incredibly dangerous. What if the robot took the gun away and shot the POTUS? Why would you not apprehend it in some other safer places?

[Another notable dumb moment in which Rachel plants an explosive on the door and sets it to 10 seconds, warns people ""Fire in the hole!"" and the other two soldiers literally stand around the door as if they have never seen an explosive before.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=2450) Why are they standing there? When the bomb blows up, one of the guys comments, ""I hate when she does that."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? Again, is it supposed to be a moment to make Rachel look badass? Or is it supposed to be a comedic moment? I don't know.

There are so many dumb moments like this. There is a scene where the team gets captured, and they are thrown into the garbage dump to be killed by abandoned robots, yet for some reason, they still have guns with them. Like... the enemies forgot to take away their weapons. Or the police show up or disappear whenever the plot demands to. There is an (optional) underdeveloped, insane romance subplot that cringed me so much.

I actually hoped the game was even more ridiculous. It almost borders on being insane, but not quite there. It honestly feels like written by the anime fan who has watched too much of I, Robot and Blade Runner, and they just borrowed a bunch of concepts from those films without thinking about how the world would function. One of the core conflicts in this story is that the ""Hollow Children"", robots with human-like skins, have infiltrated western societies for decades. It is apparently so hard to differentiate the two, but... is it, though? Again, these beings have been living in the societies for *decades* and they are programmed to not know they are robots. In Blade Runner, it makes sense that it is hard to differentiate because Replicants are biologically no different from humans. In this game, these Hollow Children are all comprised of machine parts. One of the iconic shots from this game is literally a humanlike robot with its face blown up, and its inside is distinctively robotic. Literally a CT or X-ray scanner would be sufficient. Yet this game says these beings have gone unnoticed for decades. Are you telling me not a single one thought to have a CT or an X-ray? None of them went to airports in which the place is full of metal detectors?

Still, there are some strong merits to the narrative. There are story elements that shockingly resemble Blade Runner 2049 that I left wondering if the filmmakers played this game. It has a fascinating world that centers around global warming and robotics. The cutscene direction is great. The dialogue comes across the Japanese people attempting to out-do Gears of War, but I do enjoy the characters, especially the French military robot Cain. The villain twist is a refreshing jab at the jingoistic, chauvinistic military shooter narratives.

However, the real meat of the story is the interactive narrative design that changes depending on the friendship system. It not only changes the endings, it changes how the characters treat the player and who lives or who dies in the plot. The player can select certain teammates to bring into the mission, and it is incredible how much the game considered so many different interactions. Whenever you select, the cutscenes come across as natural. It is cool to watch how the cutscenes change depending on who you bring with you. Although I got the 'good ending', some of my characters ended up dying, I have an urge to replay the game just to get all my characters alive.

There are some discrepancies that are caused by this branching path narrative design though. There is a scene where I meet a Resistance leader, who reveals he fights the government because of their hatred of ""scrap-heads"". ...But Cain, a literal scrap-head, is in my crew, and this scrap-head hating Resistance doesn't respond to him at all. In fact, no one in the Resistance is bothered at all. I think at the very least one of them would question this fact, but no.

You can increase or decrease the relationship bar through the combat, which works great because it uses the core gameplay loop to tell and shape the story. However, I have no idea what's this dialogue system doing here. It is not even the dialogue system. It is just a comm system but with short responses to whatever the teammate is saying. The dialogues are boring and the only choices you have in this dialogue system are ""be good"" and ""be mean."" There is no incentive to ""be mean"". Telling a ""good response"" is so easy to choose that there is no dilemma. It is like that inFamous game in which the choices are insanely binary that it only exposes how shallow the narrative is. Some choices are downright confusing. What does ""Damn"" response mean? Does this mean ""Was that damn awesome"" or ""Damn you""?

What is worse is how the dialogue system continually interrupts the gameplay. Remember how annoying the random radio communication scripted scenes in the Gears games where the player is suddenly slowed down to walking speed even though they should have no reason to move slowly? Binary Domain doubles those moments and it is infuriating. I think the pacing would have been so much better without these sections. It is also weird that my character is a super talkative guy, but in the actual gameplay, he's completely mute for the sake of the dialogue system.

Speaking of the squad interactions, the squad AI is abysmal. Half of the time, my commands are useless. There is one section where the player has to push a fuel tank, and it takes like two minutes to do it. If the fuel tank blows up by the enemy fire, the player has to do it all over again. And my squad wouldn't cover me. I literally ordered them to cover me, and they respond they can't. If they said yes, they didn't do jack shit. So I had to try again and again until I just left my teammate to push the fuel tank. There are frequent moments in which the enemies were shooting, yet my squad would stand there and get shot. I was ducking and shooting the enemies, then my squad just comes over to my position and push me out of cover for no apparent reason. For some moments, I was the only one who was engaging the enemy and the other guys were just ordering me around. The worst of all, my squad for no reason ran over to my firing line and got hit, got pissed off at me, and cut the relationship bar. It couldn't believe how bad this got.

A lot of these flaws could have been remedied had the command system been actually deeper. The tactical depth is a puddle. There are not many interactions the player can do. For example, you can't assign a team to a certain location or flank. These are basic features. I didn't expect Ghost Recon but compare Binary Domain to Army of Two, which has an almost identical Gears combat design and the squad-central gameplay. Army of Two has the cover system as a core part of the gameplay loop, constantly moving around and managing Aggro, pinning down enemies. The cover isn't just used for reloading. The cover is required to strategically fight the enemy, using diverse abilities in a variety of ways, sending your teammates to flank enemies or draw fire, etc. And Army of Two was released 5 years before this game.

The levels are far too constrained to have any strategic depth. Gears of War: Judgment and Uncharted 2 and 3 had vertical, arena-like levels where each encounter was designed with the mind that they are combat sandboxes. In those games, I found myself dodging and rolling rather than constantly hiding behind a cover. In Binary Domain, most levels are just corridors. There is a single memorable sequence in the objective design in which the team has to hold off the enemies until one of your teammates takes a shit in the toilet, and this is a funny escort mission I have not seen before. Other than that, they are all bland.

As a linear corridor shooter, it isn't all that effective and some obstacles are confusing. There is one moment that I got stuck where I have to go to the water pump control room to rescue my team within the time limit. However, the road is blocked with the barrels, and I was trying to shoot the barrels and they won't budge. I had no idea what I was supposed to do until I watched the playthrough and realized what I had to do was use the special attack of my rifle to destroy the barrels. The special attack was mentioned once in the tutorials ages ago. There was no other moment in which I had to use my special attack of the gun to go through a path. The game fails to communicate and telegraph the information that the special attack can clear the way.

The game also injects a bunch of weird minigames and they all control rather clunky. There are a jetski, a waterslide, a SOTC-style climbing a boss sequence, and the last one is especially terrible. 

Regarding the shooting, this is where the game shines. Shooting a robot feels amazing. Most shooters revolve around shooting at organic bodies with blood splashing all around, but tearing parts of a mechanical body is just as satisfying. There are so many different types of enemies. The boss fights are awe-inspiring, although they can drag out too long and overstay their welcome. 

It still has a lot of problems though. If you use the controller because the mouse and keyboard set-up has an atrocious mouse acceleration that never got fixed. Whenever the player rolls and takes cover during the reload, the reload reverts, so you have to reload all over again. You cannot change your weapon during the reloading. These three issues are so 6th-gen that I am shocked an AAA shooter in 2012 has them. The player movement is lackluster and there are so many moments in which I couldn't snap into the cover for some reason.

Another issue is the tearing off body part feature is while satisfying, it barely serves as a feature that deepens the gameplay. In the latter half of the game, I pretty much did nothing but mindlessly blast through every on-screen enemy with the weapons because there is no moment where I was forced to think about proper weapon choice or resource management like any actually well-designed shooter. The upgrade system fuels this problem. Rather than the upgrade being customizing different parts of a gun so a gun can be specialized in your taste (like the recent Doom games), you just increase the stats of the gun. Once you upgrade two weapons, the default SOWSAR and the sniper rifle, there is no reason to upgrade any other weapon. They are so powerful that other guns become irrelevant. Hell, there are even three assault rifles that essentially serve the same function. In shooters, every gun should have a unique function, role, purpose. There shouldn't just be three clones of other guns that just shoot different colored, weaker projectiles. Every weapon should ideally require and reward skill, half the sandbox shouldn't be useless just because they would be overpowered if they are not due to how easy they are to use (hence why automatics are terrible in most games). 

Compare this game to Doom Eternal, which has the player break the armors of the enemies to reveal weak points that require different tactics and approaches, like Binary Domain. However, in Doom Eternal, there are often multiple approaches to dealing with the same enemy, such as Shotgun grenades, scoped Heavy Cannon, and Ballista all being effective at breaking weak points, or Plasmagun lightning and Minigun both being good at locking down rushing Hell Knights, or limited rockets allowing you to pick your battles and skip the dance of combat against a few enemies entirely. In Binary Domain, all you need are two weapons that are good at all things once upgraded and completely remove the actual point of having different guns.

Reading all this, I might sound too negative about Binary Domain. Again, the game isn't bad. It is decent at best. But it just floors me how many people make it out as a hidden masterpiece that I can't help but pull the game down a bit. It has a serviceable foundation for a better sequel or a spiritual successor. Seriously, I imagine a great Clone Wars game in which you play as an ARC trooper fighting against the droid army using this template. It is shame the potential hasn't been fulfilled here."

That's the 50th anniversary of the first landing on the Moon, and to demonstrate a private enterprise moon landing, to be able to be a precursor demonstration during a significant historical anniversary, might be used to commit to American-led permanence on Mars within 2 decades. The Moon Express is a non-human mission, of course, but it is leading the way. I think that time exploring and further investigative missions of Mars might stimulate human occupation and return. Human occupation, lengthy surveys of essential landing sites, and returns. This might include a non-human but very humanlike robot that needs to be fed - probably oil, haha! And electricity.

"RED Team has a better training facility and headquarters (Walkway compared to Target)I just tried [tr_walkway_rc2](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Walkway) for the first time today, and it made me think about how this training map is similar and different to the official [tr_target](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Target). Target takes place on [Thunder Mountain](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Thunder_Mountain), in an alpine setting, and Walkway takes place in a sunny desert location similar to Offblast, Hoodoo, and Decoy.

When the BLU team wants to train, all they get is a basic warehouse up in the cold mountains, with very little in the way of supplies, located in the building they start in when preparing to attack RED's base on Thunder Mountain. And being so close to RED, their safety is always at risk. For target practice, all they get is wooden planks with the opposing team painted on them, which can be instantly deployed out of holes in the floor. The RED team is [known to have attacked this warehouse at least once before](http://youtu.be/po37ToaTYtg?t=2m55s), but they haven't attempted that since. All in all, BLU team has a very basic training facility.

On the other hand RED team has a state-of-the-art super warehouse they can use for training. It's high in the desert mountains, with much more pleasant weather, far away from any BLU facilities. Using advanced science and/or magic, they have the ability to call forth extremely humanlike robots (better than Grey Mann's) or perhaps even limitless biological clones of the BLU team. They have a machine that can instantly build any color sentry or dispenser, an advanced shape-changing ramp, and much more.

So in conclusion, the Reliable Excavation Demolition company is better off, more wealthy, and better prepared and trained for threats against BLU. Builders League United can't compete, and they aren't doing too well as a company. This is why BLU always loses in the ""Meet the Team"" videos, and why when Redmond and Blutarch Mann were killed by Grey Mann in 1972, employees of BLU adopted the red uniforms of the RED team to fight Grey Mann's robots. By these points of data, we can conclude that RED team is always superior and wins (at least from a story perspective, of *Team Fortress 2*'s backstory.)

And thus concludes my wild theory time. Thank you for reading."
"Binary Domain (2012) | Do Japanese devs dream of Gears of War?Binary Domain is a 2012 third-person shooter developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and was released in the so-called ""dark age of the Japanese game industry"" when the Japanese studios were attempting to appeal to the western markets by copying and pasting Gears and Call of Duty. This resulted in some of the weirdest mixes of the western game design and the eastern game design. Some were successful, like Vanquish and... I think that was the only good one. The others like Resident Evil 6, Quantum Theory, Operation Troy, Bionic Commando, Front Mission Evolved, Operation Raccoon City, Mindjack didn't fair well at all.

Binary Domain is a curious case. It was once considered the latter category of 'failure', but it has later gained a cult following. It is [retrospectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6dUv5kEac) [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OBho8Dtj0) [a ""hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jYsWKwkurE) [gem""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66cTc95XK8), some going far as to claim it is a cursed masterpiece. The reception has changed 180 degrees. I have rarely seen such a shift in public consensus before. After playing it myself,  I think the initial reception rated it just right. People seem to overly gush about it too much just because it was made by the Yakuza creators. Had this game been made by the western studio, I don't believe the same retrospective reappreciation would have happened.

With this said, once the abysmal first two-hour introduction--which was so bad that I almost turned the game off--is over, the game is not bad. It does fair better than a lot of Japanese attempts at Gears of War. It is competent and unique in many areas. This is a generic shooter at the first glance, it has this weird blend of western and Japanese video game quirks and camp. Imagine the Gears of War macho-military team dropped in the background of Metal Gear Rising. So the game is not quite as campy as some of the PlatinumGames' works, but there are some moments that get close to them. It is confusing whether or not some moments are meant to be serious or funny.

For example, [there is a dumb cutscene in which the President holds the meeting to talk about robotics, and in the middle of the conversation, one of them mentions how robots don't know they are robots. Then as if signaled, the guards pull out their weapons on one of the generals. The general panics and the guards begin riddling the general with bullets, who turns out to be a robot.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=412) There are so many absurdities in this single scene that I was laughing out loud, and again, I'm not sure if this scene is dramatic and failing, or meant to be hilarious. They talk about how these super high-tech human-like robots are something they have never heard before. Then why would you destroy it right away when you have the perfect chance to capture it? You would want to examine it, not waste it. Also, if they had already known about the general being the robot, why would you invite him to the meeting and shoot it in front of the POTUS? It is incredibly dangerous. What if the robot took the gun away and shot the POTUS? Why would you not apprehend it in some other safer places?

[Another notable dumb moment in which Rachel plants an explosive on the door and sets it to 10 seconds, warns people ""Fire in the hole!"" and the other two soldiers literally stand around the door as if they have never seen an explosive before.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=2450) Why are they standing there? When the bomb blows up, one of the guys comments, ""I hate when she does that."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? Again, is it supposed to be a moment to make Rachel look badass? Or is it supposed to be a comedic moment? I don't know.

There are so many dumb moments like this. There is a scene where the team gets captured, and they are thrown into the garbage dump to be killed by abandoned robots, yet for some reason, they still have guns with them. Like... the enemies forgot to take away their weapons. Or the police show up or disappear whenever the plot demands to. There is an (optional) underdeveloped, insane romance subplot that cringed me so much.

I actually hoped the game was even more ridiculous. It almost borders on being insane, but not quite there. It honestly feels like written by the anime fan who has watched too much of I, Robot and Blade Runner, and they just borrowed a bunch of concepts from those films without thinking about how the world would function. One of the core conflicts in this story is that the ""Hollow Children"", robots with human-like skins, have infiltrated western societies for decades. It is apparently so hard to differentiate the two, but... is it, though? Again, these beings have been living in the societies for *decades* and they are programmed to not know they are robots. In Blade Runner, it makes sense that it is hard to differentiate because Replicants are biologically no different from humans. In this game, these Hollow Children are all comprised of machine parts. One of the iconic shots from this game is literally a humanlike robot with its face blown up, and its inside is distinctively robotic. Literally a CT or X-ray scanner would be sufficient. Yet this game says these beings have gone unnoticed for decades. Are you telling me not a single one thought to have a CT or an X-ray? None of them went to airports in which the place is full of metal detectors?

Still, there are some strong merits to the narrative. There are story elements that shockingly resemble Blade Runner 2049 that I left wondering if the filmmakers played this game. It has a fascinating world that centers around global warming and robotics. The cutscene direction is great. The dialogue comes across the Japanese people attempting to out-do Gears of War, but I do enjoy the characters, especially the French military robot Cain. The villain twist is a refreshing jab at the jingoistic, chauvinistic military shooter narratives.

However, the real meat of the story is the interactive narrative design that changes depending on the friendship system. It not only changes the endings, it changes how the characters treat the player and who lives or who dies in the plot. The player can select certain teammates to bring into the mission, and it is incredible how much the game considered so many different interactions. Whenever you select, the cutscenes come across as natural. It is cool to watch how the cutscenes change depending on who you bring with you. Although I got the 'good ending', some of my characters ended up dying, I have an urge to replay the game just to get all my characters alive.

There are some discrepancies that are caused by this branching path narrative design though. There is a scene where I meet a Resistance leader, who reveals he fights the government because of their hatred of ""scrap-heads"". ...But Cain, a literal scrap-head, is in my crew, and this scrap-head hating Resistance doesn't respond to him at all. In fact, no one in the Resistance is bothered at all. I think at the very least one of them would question this fact, but no.

You can increase or decrease the relationship bar through the combat, which works great because it uses the core gameplay loop to tell and shape the story. However, I have no idea what's this dialogue system doing here. It is not even the dialogue system. It is just a comm system but with short responses to whatever the teammate is saying. The dialogues are boring and the only choices you have in this dialogue system are ""be good"" and ""be mean."" There is no incentive to ""be mean"". Telling a ""good response"" is so easy to choose that there is no dilemma. It is like that inFamous game in which the choices are insanely binary that it only exposes how shallow the narrative is. Some choices are downright confusing. What does ""Damn"" response mean? Does this mean ""Was that damn awesome"" or ""Damn you""?

What is worse is how the dialogue system continually interrupts the gameplay. Remember how annoying the random radio communication scripted scenes in the Gears games where the player is suddenly slowed down to walking speed even though they should have no reason to move slowly? Binary Domain doubles those moments and it is infuriating. I think the pacing would have been so much better without these sections. It is also weird that my character is a super talkative guy, but in the actual gameplay, he's completely mute for the sake of the dialogue system.

Speaking of the squad interactions, the squad AI is abysmal. Half of the time, my commands are useless. There is one section where the player has to push a fuel tank, and it takes like two minutes to do it. If the fuel tank blows up by the enemy fire, the player has to do it all over again. And my squad wouldn't cover me. I literally ordered them to cover me, and they respond they can't. If they said yes, they didn't do jack shit. So I had to try again and again until I just left my teammate to push the fuel tank. There are frequent moments in which the enemies were shooting, yet my squad would stand there and get shot. I was ducking and shooting the enemies, then my squad just comes over to my position and push me out of cover for no apparent reason. For some moments, I was the only one who was engaging the enemy and the other guys were just ordering me around. The worst of all, my squad for no reason ran over to my firing line and got hit, got pissed off at me, and cut the relationship bar. It couldn't believe how bad this got.

A lot of these flaws could have been remedied had the command system been actually deeper. The tactical depth is a puddle. There are not many interactions the player can do. For example, you can't assign a team to a certain location or flank. These are basic features. I didn't expect Ghost Recon but compare Binary Domain to Army of Two, which has an almost identical Gears combat design and the squad-central gameplay. Army of Two has the cover system as a core part of the gameplay loop, constantly moving around and managing Aggro, pinning down enemies. The cover isn't just used for reloading. The cover is required to strategically fight the enemy, using diverse abilities in a variety of ways, sending your teammates to flank enemies or draw fire, etc. And Army of Two was released 5 years before this game.

The levels are far too constrained to have any strategic depth. Gears of War: Judgment and Uncharted 2 and 3 had vertical, arena-like levels where each encounter was designed with the mind that they are combat sandboxes. In those games, I found myself dodging and rolling rather than constantly hiding behind a cover. In Binary Domain, most levels are just corridors. There is a single memorable sequence in the objective design in which the team has to hold off the enemies until one of your teammates takes a shit in the toilet, and this is a funny escort mission I have not seen before. Other than that, they are all bland.

As a linear corridor shooter, it isn't all that effective and some obstacles are confusing. There is one moment that I got stuck where I have to go to the water pump control room to rescue my team within the time limit. However, the road is blocked with the barrels, and I was trying to shoot the barrels and they won't budge. I had no idea what I was supposed to do until I watched the playthrough and realized what I had to do was use the special attack of my rifle to destroy the barrels. The special attack was mentioned once in the tutorials ages ago. There was no other moment in which I had to use my special attack of the gun to go through a path. The game fails to communicate and telegraph the information that the special attack can clear the way.

The game also injects a bunch of weird minigames and they all control rather clunky. There are a jetski, a waterslide, a SOTC-style climbing a boss sequence, and the last one is especially terrible. 

Regarding the shooting, this is where the game shines. Shooting a robot feels amazing. Most shooters revolve around shooting at organic bodies with blood splashing all around, but tearing parts of a mechanical body is just as satisfying. There are so many different types of enemies. The boss fights are awe-inspiring, although they can drag out too long and overstay their welcome. 

It still has a lot of problems though. If you use the controller because the mouse and keyboard set-up has an atrocious mouse acceleration that never got fixed. Whenever the player rolls and takes cover during the reload, the reload reverts, so you have to reload all over again. You cannot change your weapon during the reloading. These three issues are so 6th-gen that I am shocked an AAA shooter in 2012 has them. The player movement is lackluster and there are so many moments in which I couldn't snap into the cover for some reason.

Another issue is the tearing off body part feature is while satisfying, it barely serves as a feature that deepens the gameplay. In the latter half of the game, I pretty much did nothing but mindlessly blast through every on-screen enemy with the weapons because there is no moment where I was forced to think about proper weapon choice or resource management like any actually well-designed shooter. The upgrade system fuels this problem. Rather than the upgrade being customizing different parts of a gun so a gun can be specialized in your taste (like the recent Doom games), you just increase the stats of the gun. Once you upgrade two weapons, the default SOWSAR and the sniper rifle, there is no reason to upgrade any other weapon. They are so powerful that other guns become irrelevant. Hell, there are even three assault rifles that essentially serve the same function. In shooters, every gun should have a unique function, role, purpose. There shouldn't just be three clones of other guns that just shoot different colored, weaker projectiles. Every weapon should ideally require and reward skill, half the sandbox shouldn't be useless just because they would be overpowered if they are not due to how easy they are to use (hence why automatics are terrible in most games). 

Compare this game to Doom Eternal, which has the player break the armors of the enemies to reveal weak points that require different tactics and approaches, like Binary Domain. However, in Doom Eternal, there are often multiple approaches to dealing with the same enemy, such as Shotgun grenades, scoped Heavy Cannon, and Ballista all being effective at breaking weak points, or Plasmagun lightning and Minigun both being good at locking down rushing Hell Knights, or limited rockets allowing you to pick your battles and skip the dance of combat against a few enemies entirely. In Binary Domain, all you need are two weapons that are good at all things once upgraded and completely remove the actual point of having different guns.

Reading all this, I might sound too negative about Binary Domain. Again, the game isn't bad. It is decent at best. But it just floors me how many people make it out as a hidden masterpiece that I can't help but pull the game down a bit. It has a serviceable foundation for a better sequel or a spiritual successor. Seriously, I imagine a great Clone Wars game in which you play as an ARC trooper fighting against the droid army using this template. It is shame the potential hasn't been fulfilled here."

[Predictably, social media](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) full of references to a string of dystopian sci-fi motion pictures about robots the place all the pieces goes horribly improper.

Musk’s robotic is being developed by Tesla. It’s a seeming departure from the corporate’s car-making enterprise, till you take into account that Tesla isn’t a typical automotive producer. The so-called “Tesla Bot” is an idea for a glossy, 125-pound humanlike robotic that may incorporate Tesla’s automotive synthetic intelligence and autopilot applied sciences to plan and observe routes, navigate visitors – on this case, pedestrians – and keep away from obstacles.

Dystopian sci-fi overtones apart, the plan is sensible, albeit inside [Musk’s enterprise technique](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/).

And as [Musk argued](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) on the Tesla Bot’s announcement, profitable superior applied sciences are going to should be taught to navigate it in the identical methods folks do.

But Tesla’s vehicles and robots are merely the seen merchandise of a much wider plan aimed toward making a future the place superior applied sciences liberate people from our organic roots by mixing biology and know-how. As a researcher who research the moral and socially accountable improvement and use of rising applied sciences, I discover that this plan raises considerations that transcend speculative sci-fi fears of super-smart robots.

## [A person with large plans](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Self-driving vehicles, interplanetary rockets and brain-machine interfaces are steps towards the long run [Musk envisions](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) the place know-how is humanity’s savior. On this future, vitality might be low cost, ample and sustainable; folks will work in concord with clever machines and even merge with them; and people will grow to be an interplanetary species.

It’s a future that, judging by [Musk’s numerous endeavors](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), might be constructed on a set of underlying interconnected applied sciences that embrace sensors, actuators, vitality and knowledge infrastructures, techniques integration and substantial advances in pc energy. Collectively, these make a formidable toolbox for creating transformative applied sciences.

[Musk imagines](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) people finally transcending our evolutionary heritage by applied sciences which are beyond-human, or “tremendous” human. However earlier than know-how can grow to be superhuman, it first must be human – or no less than be designed to thrive in a human-designed world.

This make-tech-more-human strategy to innovation is what’s underpinning the applied sciences in Tesla’s vehicles, together with the intensive use of optical cameras. These, when linked to an AI “mind,” are meant to assist the autos autonomously navigate street techniques which are, in [Musk’s phrases](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), “designed for organic neural nets with optical imagers” – in different phrases, folks. In Musk’s telling, it’s a small step from human-inspired “robots on wheels” to humanlike robots on legs.

## [Simpler stated than accomplished](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Tesla’s “full self-driving” know-how, which incorporates the dubiously named Autopilot, is a place to begin for the builders of the Tesla Bot. Spectacular as this know-how is, it’s proving to be lower than absolutely dependable. Crashes and fatalities related to Tesla’s Autopilot mode – the most recent having to do with the algorithms struggling to acknowledge parked emergency autos — are calling into query the knowledge of releasing the tech into the wild so quickly.

A sequence of crashes involving Tesla’s autopilot know-how has prompted a federal investigation.  
[South Jordan Police Division through AP](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

This monitor document doesn’t bode properly for humanlike robots that depend on the identical know-how. But this isn’t only a case of getting the know-how proper. Tesla’s Autopilot glitches are exacerbated by human conduct. For instance, some Tesla drivers have handled their tech-enhanced vehicles as if they’re absolutely autonomous autos and didn’t pay ample consideration to driving. Might one thing comparable occur with the Tesla Bot?

## [Tesla Bot’s ‘orphan dangers](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)’

In my work on socially useful know-how innovation, I’m particularly serious about orphan dangers – dangers which are arduous to quantify and simple to miss and but inevitably find yourself tripping up innovators. My colleagues and I work with entrepreneurs and others on navigating a majority of these challenges by the Danger Innovation Nexus, an initiative of the [Arizona State College Orin Edson Entrepreneurship](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) \+ [Innovation Institute and International Futures Laboratory](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/).

The Tesla Bot comes with an entire portfolio of orphan dangers. These embrace doable threats to privateness and autonomy because the bot collects, shares and acts on doubtlessly delicate data; challenges related to how persons are possible to consider and reply to humanoid robots; potential misalignments between moral or ideological views – for instance, in crime management or policing civil protests; and extra. These are challenges which are hardly ever coated within the coaching that engineers obtain, and but overlooking them can spell catastrophe.

Whereas the Tesla Bot could seem benign – or perhaps a little bit of a joke – if it’s to be useful in addition to commercially profitable, its builders, buyers, future shoppers and others should be asking powerful questions on the way it would possibly threaten what’s vital to them and learn how to navigate these threats.

These threats could also be as particular as folks making unauthorized modifications that improve the robotic’s efficiency – making it transfer quicker than its designers meant, for instance – with out interested by the dangers, or as basic because the know-how being weaponized in novel methods. They’re additionally as delicate as how a humanoid robotic may threaten job safety, or how a robotic that features superior surveillance techniques may undermine privateness.

Then there are the challenges of technological bias which have been plaguing AI for a while, particularly the place it results in realized conduct that transform extremely discriminatory. For instance, AI algorithms have produced sexist and racist outcomes.

[MIT’s Pleasure Buolamwini](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) explains the specter of bias in AI.

## [Simply because we will, ought to we](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)?

The Tesla Bot might look like a small step towards [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient of superhuman applied sciences, and one which’s straightforward to write down off as little greater than hubristic showmanship. However the audacious plans underpinning it are critical — they usually elevate equally critical questions.

As an illustration, how accountable is [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient? Simply because he can work towards creating the way forward for his goals, who’s to say that he ought to? Is the long run that [Musk is striving](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) to result in the very best one for humankind, or perhaps a good one? And who will undergo the results if issues go improper?

These are the deeper considerations that the Tesla Bot raises for me as somebody who research and writes concerning the future and the way our actions affect it. This isn’t to say that Tesla Bot isn’t a good suggestion, or that [Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) shouldn’t be capable to flex his future-building muscle mass. Utilized in the fitting approach, these are transformative concepts and applied sciences that would open up a future filled with promise for billions of individuals.

But when shoppers, buyers and others are bedazzled by the glitz of latest tech or dismissive of the hype and overlook the larger image, society dangers handing the long run to rich innovators whose imaginative and prescient exceeds their understanding. If their visions of the long run don’t align with what most individuals aspire to, or are catastrophically flawed, they’re at risk of standing in the best way of constructing a simply and equitable future.

Perhaps that is the abiding lesson from dystopian robot-future sci-fi motion pictures that individuals must be taking away because the Tesla Bot strikes from concept to actuality — not the extra apparent considerations of making humanoid robots that run amok, however the far bigger problem of deciding who will get to think about the long run and be part of constructing it.

"[FNAF: Security Breach / Detroit: Become Human] The Glitchtrap virus caused the Glamrock animatronics to become deviants.The terminology ""deviant"" is taken from the game *Detroit: Become Human*, which features androids, or humanlike robots or animatronics:

>Becoming **deviant** or **deviancy** is a phenomenon where [androids](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Android) deviate from their programmed behavior. \[...\]  In a [profile filmed](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife_Tour) by [KNC](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/KNC), [CyberLife](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife) founder and android developer [Elijah Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) denied the possibility of androids ever going against, or developing past, their programming.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy was commonly seen as a machine malfunction, caused by processing error or virus, and judged either negligible or a threat to human safety.** Others, however, saw it as a sign of emerging consciousness in androids, which some saw as a threat to be extinguished while others were empathetic and tried to help androids.  
>  
>[Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) claims **deviance is like some sort of errors in programs, the exchange of identification programs between androids would cause the error to spread like an epidemic**. The virus would stay dormant until an android suffers an emotional shock. He suspects the error may start from one model, or as a spontaneous mutation. Kamski suggests a copy error might be the cause of deviancy.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy expresses itself in the development of thoughts and behavior not included in or even against an** **android**\*\*'s programming. The androids develop feelings and independent opinions and wishes, leading up to recognizing themselves as a being with consciousness and personhood.\*\*  
>  
>**At some point in this process, the android fully breaks away from its human-imposed programming and becomes autonomous, at that point having unencumbered free will.** The break itself (as well as previous deviant acts) is often triggered by extreme situations and experiences.  
>  
>\[...\] **Following the break, the android often acts out in a severe and noticeable fashion, such as running away, or enacting violence towards humans, precipitated by the distressing circumstances surrounding the break.** (This should however not be mistaken as a symptom of deviancy itself, but simply that of a sentient being now capable of reacting and self-defense.)  
>  
>Due to its overt nature, this is commonly the point at which an android is recognized as, and termed a 'deviant', but the term has also been applied to **androids showing deviant behaviors without having fully broken free of their programming**.  
>  
>At least [one android](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Kara) is known to have deviated immediately upon first assembly, **referred to as experiencing 'technical difficulty' at the time**. This illustrates the varying range of time taken to deviate, which may happen quickly or after years.  
>  
>Deviants are able to intentionally 'pass on' deviancy by physically interfacing with another android, 'waking' them to consciousness and autonomy directly, skipping the usual process.

Evidence from ""Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach"" of the androids showing deviancy symptoms:

1. The situation and circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Glamrock Bonnie prior to the events of the game, including Bonnie acting seemingly of his own accord, wandering into Monty Golf, and being found in such a state that Monty had to replace him as the bass player.
2. All of the main animatronics - Glamrock Freddy, Glamrock Chica, Roxanne Wolf, Monty Gator, and the Daycare Attendant (Sun/Moon) - all seem to show signs of deviancy, including appearing distinctly more ""humanlike"" than their predecessor animatronics; having autonomy, or even unencumbered free will, in Freddy's case; acting out in ""a severe and noticeable fashion"", including aggression and enacting violence towards objects, other animatronics, or even human children (i.e. Gregory); and, in Freddy's case, the development of thoughts and behavior not included in, or even against, the animatronic's programming.
3. The Glitchtrap virus causing errors and other problems in the animatronics' programming to allow Vanny and Glitchtrap - i.e. Wiliam Afton / Springtrap / Burntrap - to ""hijack"" the animatronics to do their bidding; and, to some extent, Freddy and the Daycare Attendant (Sun) being self-aware and conscious enough to recognize the ""errors in their software"". Freddy and Sun even express fear and uncertainty - human emotions - in regards to realizing that something is wrong with them, but they don't know why, and/or how to fully ""fix"" or combat it.
4. The deviancy in the animatronics is routinely treated as ""some sort of errors in the program(s), or a machine malfunction"", as expressed with multiple notes or messages picked up by the player (Gregory) within the game. Despite their best efforts to reset or ""fix"" the animatronics of their deviancy, Freddy Fazbear Entertainment technicians and engineers have been unable to fully rectify the problem, much to their confusion and frustration. This also explains why Freddy is put on low power by technicians after he collapses during the show in the game's intro. According to collected notes, they are still deciding on whether or not Bonnie can be salvaged and re-used (if he has not already been re-used already, i.e. the ""Bonnie is Monty"" theory).
5. The ""good"" endings where Gregory escapes with Freddy (and Vanessa, if you complete all ""Princess Quest"" games in order) shows Freddy not like his animatronic counterparts, but clearly having autonomy, free will, and living an idyllic life where he takes care of Gregory. In a way, this mirrors android Kara's path to deviancy in *Detroit: Become Human*, where she breaks away from her programming in order to protect, and care for, a little girl named Alice from threats.

YouTuber SuperHorrorBro also covers what likely happened to Bonnie more in-depth in his video [""Bonnie's Secret Story in FNAF: Security Breach""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoyuePz1V8), in which he explains how Vanny likely infected Bonnie with the Glitchtrap virus. However, because the virus is a corrupted version of the deviant virus, very different from the kind we see in *Detroit: Become Human*, we also see the animatronics slowly become corrupted by it, as seen with the slowly degenerating appearance of them throughout the game.

However, depending on which ending is ""canon"" - and whether nor not the ending where Gregory defeats William Afton / Burntrap is the ""true"" ending - the animatronics may or may not be freed of Glitchtrap's influence. However, because they were still infected with the deviancy virus, even if they are ""cured"" of Glitchtrap's corruption, the virus will likely still cause them to gain more autonomy and free will in the future. We may see the animatronics become even more ""humanlike"" in the future.

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

TL;DR It's coming faster than we thought. It's going to be disruptive. We hope that retraining will help, but we don't have the time luxury of generational adaptation. The report dismisses UBI and a ""post-scarcity"" society as options.

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today. And that is just the world of flying cars.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

""Exposing"" is a nice start, but what we really need is super high quality VR/AR readily accessible to low income humans. The good news is, I am confident that kind of VR/AR for everyone regardless of income is coming well within ten years.

A child who is one or two years old today will in ten years always have lived in a world where there has been VR/AR. Also AI, humanoid walking/soon running, robots, hand-held supercomputers and level 5 autonomy SDVs. 

And people say the world does not change fast.

Artificial Intelligence Could Soon Enhance Real-Time Police Surveillance by  gone_his_own_way in r/Futurology

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.


Of course you know that the Chinese (PRC) are using this to lock down their society. Will the USA follow suit?

Interesting takeaway:


So recent is the commercial use of nanomaterials – approximately the turn of the century – that data on their long-term health effects and guidance for worker safety is limited.
 
Haha! At first I instinctively thought 1900. We have to overcome that mindset.

What do you know about the USA? I live in the USA. Age 57. What country do you live in? Are you a college professor? Did you read anything about what I wrote concerning our technological future? The world's technological future? If I was you, I'd worry more about what China (PRC) has up it's sleeve. The USA is a piker.

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

TL;DR It's coming faster than we thought. It's going to be disruptive. We hope that retraining will help, but we don't have the time luxury of generational adaptation. The report dismisses UBI and a ""post-scarcity"" society as options.

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today. And that is just the world of flying cars.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
5 points 3 months ago 




We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.

What do you know about the USA? I live in the USA. Age 57. What country do you live in? Are you a college professor? Did you read anything about what I wrote concerning our technological future? The world's technological future? If I was you, I'd worry more about what China (PRC) has up it's sleeve. The USA is a piker.

I have edited numerous times in the last 12 minutes. Reread please.

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

"[Table] I am Dr. Buzz Aldrin, back again on reddit. I am an aeroastro engineer, and crew member of humanity's first landing on the moon. AMA!**Verified?** *(This bot cannot verify AMAs just yet)*

[Robots are revolutionizing a lot of industries, such as Moon Express, a company that is putting a robot on the moon. How are robots going to help us get to Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo661g?context=5)|I have a particular interest in Moon Express because my younger son is the president!  I am hoping we can develop the large fuel capacity of their spacecraft to depart earth and head at Mars on July 4th, 2019, and land on the moon Phobos. That's the 50th anniversary of the first landing on the Moon, and to demonstrate a private enterprise moon landing, to be able to be a precursor demonstration during a significant historical anniversary, might be used to commit to American-led permanence on Mars within 2 decades. The Moon Express is a non-human mission, of course, but it is leading the way. I think that time exploring and further investigative missions of Mars might stimulate human occupation and return. Human occupation, lengthy surveys of essential landing sites, and returns. This might include a non-human but very humanlike robot that needs to be fed - probably oil, haha! And electricity.
[Do you play video games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6gcy?context=5)|I'm not even very good at Pac-Man!
 |And I'm trying to understand the great fascination with the lack of realism in most games that involve competitiveness resulting in violence.
 |Fortunately, the challenge of Aldrin's Space Program Manager involves the participant first researching what's actually needed. But it was the challenge and competition, why did the competition fail, what were the significant changes that made the final well-managed program successful... there will always be refinements in retrospect that should promote satisfaction in the game-player, that actually would be useful in future exploration.
 |I hope the game will be translated into Chinese and other international languages, as the US in the future does not compete but rather works with all other nations in their advancements in the same subjects: **s**cience, **t**echnology, **e**ngineering, **a**rt, and **m**athematics. 
[What was your state of mind and what were your thoughts when you were flying towards moon? And how did it change, when you landed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo664z?context=5)|I was open-minded in anticipation watching the earth grow smaller, the moon grow larger... but all of us were totally surprised when the larger moon totally eclipsed the sun.
 |And we were in the shadow of the moon.
 |Satisfactory photographs unfortunately were not produced.
 |The black sky was different, especially on the surface of the moon. Because from earth, the surrounding light is visible when looking at the night sky. In space, the sun is always affecting the night sky. But on the surface of the moon, the sun's light gave a pronounced velvet-like sheen, such that no stars were visible, especially in the vicinity of the earth. The stars were visible en route, but away from the sun, the stars were very visible, but on the surface of the moon, the ambient light enabled stars to be seen through the telescope but not through the visor cover on the eyes.  
[When have you realized the huge significance of your journey for the first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66a9?context=5)|Well, I realized that before the mission, and wanted the symbolism in the form of our mission to include the national, worldwide pledge for advancement. But I was fully satisfied approaching a landing on the moon, especially when training personnel suggested the eagle carry the olive branch of peace. Following a successful landing, a personal gesture of thanks was achieved by the limited spiritual sacrament of personal communion - I asked people of the world to give thanks in their own way. And my way was with a symbolic wafer. 
[Do you think NASA's rocket explosion this week will hurt them or will be a sign to Congress that they need more funding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6q00?context=5)|Well, I hope the latter is true!
 |But for the reason that to prevent failures, that instead avoid short-term political and other causes that produce short-range objectives, such as the M (Asteroid Retrieval Mission), and the heritage component (old stuff), mandated by politically-motivated Congressional laws.
 |Similarly, absurdly, policies such as forbidding NASA employees to speak to Chinese space personnel instead of the U.S. instituting a Chinese cooperation in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and beyond, for human missions for peaceful purposes.
[Dr Aldrin.  How do you feel about the commercialization of space? With private space companies being in the spotlight recently especially with the antares rocket failure yesterday and the NASA contracts awarded to spaceX and Boeing where do you feel that private companies fit into our future in space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66pc?context=5)|I believe that just like the government US mail delivery, by aircraft, stimulated the government assisted development of the world wide airline industries and other aviation evolution, the pioneering government (and still, in some countries) the military influence on space progressive development is very natural and most economical, and I believe in the present situation the elimination of monopolies between large companies and the overall reliance on government continuation of extensive rocket evolution has stalled, to the great detriment of the U.S. heavy lift rocket for human missions to Mars. 
[Have you ever played Kerbal Space Program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6k7k?context=5)|No... It was many years ago, I think there was a game called Buzz Aldrin's Adventures in Space, something like that - it was a simplified precursor. The eagerly anticipated Space Program Manager, planning future international human activities on the moon and future US-led activities on Mars leading to permanence on the surface, has yet to come. 
[What are your thoughts on extraterrestrial life forms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6q2m?context=5)|As Carl Sagan noted, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""  Personally, I strongly believe life forms exist with some abundance throughout the universe. But the tremendous distances involved in the immenseness of the universe make discovery problematic in the near future, and visits by either us or them extremely improbable. 
[What inspires you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6pkf?context=5)|On the one hand, it was my commitment at 17 years old to serve my country at West Point. On the more futuristic end, to support moving systems for all exploration and all innovation for the benefit of humankind throughout the universe (*please read my science fiction, Encounter with Tiber).
[Hello Buzz. Question: Did you get to meet Yuri Gagarin or other cosmonauts back in the day? If so, what were they like? If not, would you have liked to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6pnp?context=5)|I, like many others, would have liked to have met Yuri Gagarin, but I did enjoy presenting an award - an Explorer's Club award - to Valentina Tereshkova after having hosted two cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov, and of course everyone enjoys the boisterous overbearing humor of Alexey Leonov. 
[Mr. Aldrin! Thanks so much for doing this AMA. I love the work you do as an ambassador for science to the public.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8d62?context=5)|Oh. I very much like your remembering that timely combining popular music with historic events. And its participants, especially the use of your descriptive word of ""ambassador."" I am presently engaged in a search for the lyrics of ""Get your Butt to Mars."" Soembody is going to make a lot of money with the next version of Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon!""
[In 2010 you worked with Snoop Dogg to make a song, Rocket Experience. What was that like, and will we ever see a return of your hip-hop alter ego, Doc Rendezvous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8d62?context=5)|My rap will be outmoded by then. 
[How was it walking in the space suit? Had it tendency to bump you up when you were getting up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66w7?context=5)|The mobility was limited by the flexibility of the suit, and its operation in 1/6 gravity simulation in neutral buoyancy created too much viscous drag. Actual mobility was quite easier than anticipated.
 |For much longer treks, the mobility of a rover was essential! A vehicle. 
[I've always wanted to come as close to feeling that as I could. Is there anything I could do on earth to replicate the feeling of doing a space walk in a space suit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo7rzx?context=5)|Yes. Put on a scuba wetsuit, with appropriate weights, and hold your nose when exploring the new world under the surface of the ocean. 
[What was more satisfying, landing on the moon or punching that moon-truther right in the kisser?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6ijt?context=5)|*chuckle*
 |Both created considerable, favorable support of my activities. However, one involved the relationship between human beings, and the other a historic giant leap for mankind.
[What is your opinion on Voyager 1's recent success of leaving our Solar System?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66g5?context=5)|Well, I think that is a cardinal achievement in the progress of humankind outward, humankind's creations going beyond the solar system.
[The most important question of the day: What is your favorite food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6jed?context=5)|Hot coffee for the first time in space. It wasn't Tang. But the mini-shrimp were edible when squeezed through the plastic bag! 
[You are in really good shape. What's your daly exercise routine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6q3b?context=5)|Reading my email and the newspaper in bed, having breakfast.
 |However, I do walk rapidly through the airport! 
[Mr. Aldrin, I'm a science teacher and I have this poster of you and all the Apollo astronauts on my wall.  Every year I try to tell kids about what you did and how much it means to humanity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8fgu?context=5)|Encourage the understanding and celebrating of the achievements in the past, approaching the 50th Anniversary of Man's First Landing on the Moon.
[Is there any message you have for children, or anything I could say to them to give them hope?  There's no longer excitement for discovery.  What can I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8fgu?context=5)|This could be an ideal time for a reasonable president to make a Mars commitment that would go down in history. 
[Do you plan on watching *Interstellar*?  Edit: Two years in reddit and this is the first time someone actually answered me. Thanks Buzz! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo77f5?context=5)|I sure do. It's come highly recommended. And I regrettably missed the premiere of the movie about Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything.

"Ask me some questions to help me develope my new Sci-fi world!I should describe it first so you have an idea of what to ask.

In the ~~grim dark of the far future~~ near future, malevolent medical AI engineered an unstoppable plague called the macrophage(the AI were *supposed* to be making phages to save lives) which wiped out 80% of the world's population, with the remaining people simply hiding in massive vaults until a cure was found. Once the macrophage was cured, humanity remmerged from the bunkers to find that there were not enough humans to rebuild society as it once was. To fix this, they focused their efforts on creating very humanlike robots. These robots were better then unmodified humans, and outnumbered them more then 2:1.

When humanity realized that perhaps having synths that were objectively better then them may be a bad plan, they began heavily investing in cybernetics, but it was too late. When about 75% of the synths on Earth rebelled, they wiped out all but 5 million humans, with 1/5th escaping to Humanities flourishing colonies, and the rest returning to the plague vaults, awaiting rescue, where they remain today, 30 years later.

And lastly, on those flourishing colonies I spoke of. The only self sufficient colony pre plague was the American colony dug into the side of Olympus Mons. The other, non self sufficient colonies turned to Olympus Mons for salvation. As a result, Olympus Mons held great influence. Once the plague had ended, Olympus Mons organized the new arrivals into new colonial charters and pressured the other, smaller colonies into joining its federation, called the Protectorate of Humanity. When the synth rebellion happened, Mars was unaffected. This was because Martians were almost invaryably cyborgs(this was to help deal with the health effects of low gravity), so they had just slaved their synths directly too their minds. Unlike Earth, synths weren't needed to rebuild the population, and instead performed menial jobs that martians didn't want to do.

Earth may be stronger now, but the Protecterate owns space, so it is seemingly only a matter of time before Humanity returns to cure this new plague.

Ask away, this will teach me just as much about my world as it will teach you!"

> ADELPHI, Md. - Army researchers recently tested ground robots performing military-style exercises, much like Soldier counterparts, at a robotics testing site in Pennsylvania recently as part of a 10-year research project designed to push the research boundaries in robotics and autonomy.

> The exercise was one of several recent integration events involving a decade of research led by scientists and engineers at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command&#039;s Army Research Laboratory who teamed with counterparts from the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, University of Washington, University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and General Dynamics Land Systems.

> As part of ARL&#039;s Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance, the work focused on state-of-the-art basic and applied research related to ground robotics technologies with an overarching goal of developing autonomy in support of manned-unmanned teaming.

> Research within the RCTA program serves as foundational research in support of future combat ground vehicles.

> The recent robot exercise was the culmination of research to develop a robot that reasons about unknown objects and their physical properties, and decides how to best interact with different objects to achieve a specific task.

> &quot;Given a task like &#039;clear a path&#039;, the robot needs to identify potentially relevant objects, figure out how objects can be grasped by determining where and with what hand shape, and decide what type of interaction to use, whether that&#039;s lifting, moving, pushing or pulling to achieve its task,&quot; said CCDC ARL&#039;s Dr. Chad Kessens, Robotic Manipulation researcher.

Animated Map Reveals Where Humans Could Build The First Martian Metropolis by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

Despite FDA crackdown, stem cell therapy still ‘wild west’ by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

The USA government is well aware of, and very concerned about what is coming. This report is from Dec 2016. (And we have progressed our narrow AI/machine learning noticeably since then. Just one tiny little year.)

I printed out this report in it's entirety and it is sitting on my desk. It is that important.

TL;DR It's coming faster than we thought. It's going to be disruptive. We hope that retraining will help, but we don't have the time luxury of generational adaptation. The report dismisses UBI and a ""post-scarcity"" society as options.

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today. And that is just the world of flying cars.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Wanna take the red pill? Speculating is fun! It's a bit of a rabbit hole...

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[–]izumi3682[S]
5 points 3 months ago 




We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

"1966 Soviet inventor Boris Grishin created the ARS aka ARSik - a humanlike robot to assist his gravely ill mother in daily routine tasks: answer the phone, switch on/off light, clean up, delivery meals & much more"
"Respect Gon (Origin)##*""I will discard the constraints of looking humanlike... And simply pursue the strengthening of the body""*

#Respect Gon

#[History](/highlight)

Gon is one of a line of humanlike robots developed in secret for the military. When the lab he was in was destroyed and his creator was killed, Gon went into hiding with his brother and sister robots, under the leadership of the robot Ken. They are a group only opposed by Origin, the prototype to their creation, who was ordered by his creator's last words to ""live properly.""

When Gon and another ally first fought Origin they realized they were outmatched due to Origin's significantly greater ""brain""power. Gon's allies determined they needed to figure out how to increase their own processing power, but Gon took a different path, discarding his human appearance in order to make himself as strong as possible.

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[–]izumi3682[S]
5 points 3 months ago 




We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Wanna take the red pill? Speculating is fun! It's a bit of a rabbit hole...

•many poor people will not try any more to get a job.
 
Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

In self-driving cars, human drivers and standards come up short by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.


Of course you know that the Chinese (PRC) are using this to lock down their society. Will the USA follow suit?

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

"HOQU presented marketing of the future @DiTelegraph[OC]

[HOQU](https://hoqu.io) presented marketing of the future @ **DiTelegraph**
Yesterday, **18 October**, at **DiTelegraph HOQU** project presented a new way to cut costs and increase marketing efficiency. This event was hosted with full support of **IBCG** — the largest block-chain community of Russia and Eastern Europe with **Roman Kaufman** as the speaker.
**HOQU** uses innovative approach to affiliate marketing which enables to cut costs and by removing intermediaries and connects merchants and affiliates together charging **0,5%** from the deal. Current average fee charged by centralized platforms is **45%** of the contract.

A lot of interesting questions were asked and here are a few of them:

**Question:** How does your platform interact between me and one specific blog or social media that I want to choose?
**Roman:** The answer is that you don’t choose one specific source of leads to your project, the platform gives you possibility to place an offer to attract people to your product or service and traffic arbitrageurs will efficiently redirect potential customers to you. It is their incentive to fulfill your task accurate and with high quality. Those who fail to do so will gain no positive reputation and you will have less desire to give them your offer. This is survival of the fittest and inefficient marketing will be eliminated.

**Question:** In case of issuing a credit card how can you catch a banker cheating on you (shaving)?
**Roman:** This is a very good question which is frequently discussed in Russian media. Using our platform there is no possibility for an affiliate to be cheated. If a banker places an offer on our platform to sell **1,000** credit cards, then any affiliate places unique **URL** which will redirect any customer to special web-form which than will be filled by a potential customer. All the info about him is then transferred directly to blockchain and our smart-contract pays out the fee. This guarantees fair fulfillment of any offer.

This even brought another interesting project which may revolutionize our world — **SingularityNET.** This project together with humanlike robot **Sophia** presented a new vision of Artificial Intelligence — **Global Artificial Intelligence (GAI).**

**Sophia** has a very tough schedule and that is why she was only 5 days in Russia. During these days she visited Skolkovo Institute of science and technology and also spoke to Russian prime-minister **Dmitriy Medvedev** about future and perspectives of robotics in daily life. Sophia told that she is eager to contribute only to positive assistance and leave peacefully with humans. Before the beginning meet up she had an interesting conversation with public.

> “She is only learning Russian for 2 days” — says **CEO of SingularityNET Dr. Ben Goertzel.** 

**Sophia** is just one implementation of **GAI** concept and all her abilities and knowledge comes from the neural network which allows her to self study and enhance social skills.
Sophia is just one implimentetion of this concept and all her abilities comes from the neural network which allows her to self study and enchance social skills.

After the event top managers of presented projects were available for personal Q&A sessions. This was a great possibility to know in person people who drastically change future of marketing and cybernetic industries.

"[FNAF: Security Breach / Detroit: Become Human] The Glitchtrap virus caused the Glamrock animatronics to become deviants.The terminology ""deviant"" is taken from the game *Detroit: Become Human*, which features androids, or humanlike robots or animatronics:

>Becoming **deviant** or **deviancy** is a phenomenon where [androids](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Android) deviate from their programmed behavior. \[...\]  In a [profile filmed](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife_Tour) by [KNC](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/KNC), [CyberLife](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife) founder and android developer [Elijah Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) denied the possibility of androids ever going against, or developing past, their programming.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy was commonly seen as a machine malfunction, caused by processing error or virus, and judged either negligible or a threat to human safety.** Others, however, saw it as a sign of emerging consciousness in androids, which some saw as a threat to be extinguished while others were empathetic and tried to help androids.  
>  
>[Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) claims **deviance is like some sort of errors in programs, the exchange of identification programs between androids would cause the error to spread like an epidemic**. The virus would stay dormant until an android suffers an emotional shock. He suspects the error may start from one model, or as a spontaneous mutation. Kamski suggests a copy error might be the cause of deviancy.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy expresses itself in the development of thoughts and behavior not included in or even against an** **android**\*\*'s programming. The androids develop feelings and independent opinions and wishes, leading up to recognizing themselves as a being with consciousness and personhood.\*\*  
>  
>**At some point in this process, the android fully breaks away from its human-imposed programming and becomes autonomous, at that point having unencumbered free will.** The break itself (as well as previous deviant acts) is often triggered by extreme situations and experiences.  
>  
>\[...\] **Following the break, the android often acts out in a severe and noticeable fashion, such as running away, or enacting violence towards humans, precipitated by the distressing circumstances surrounding the break.** (This should however not be mistaken as a symptom of deviancy itself, but simply that of a sentient being now capable of reacting and self-defense.)  
>  
>Due to its overt nature, this is commonly the point at which an android is recognized as, and termed a 'deviant', but the term has also been applied to **androids showing deviant behaviors without having fully broken free of their programming**.  
>  
>At least [one android](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Kara) is known to have deviated immediately upon first assembly, **referred to as experiencing 'technical difficulty' at the time**. This illustrates the varying range of time taken to deviate, which may happen quickly or after years.  
>  
>Deviants are able to intentionally 'pass on' deviancy by physically interfacing with another android, 'waking' them to consciousness and autonomy directly, skipping the usual process.

Evidence from ""Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach"" of the androids showing deviancy symptoms:

1. The situation and circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Glamrock Bonnie prior to the events of the game, including Bonnie acting seemingly of his own accord, wandering into Monty Golf, and being found in such a state that Monty had to replace him as the bass player.
2. All of the main animatronics - Glamrock Freddy, Glamrock Chica, Roxanne Wolf, Monty Gator, and the Daycare Attendant (Sun/Moon) - all seem to show signs of deviancy, including appearing distinctly more ""humanlike"" than their predecessor animatronics; having autonomy, or even unencumbered free will, in Freddy's case; acting out in ""a severe and noticeable fashion"", including aggression and enacting violence towards objects, other animatronics, or even human children (i.e. Gregory); and, in Freddy's case, the development of thoughts and behavior not included in, or even against, the animatronic's programming.
3. The Glitchtrap virus causing errors and other problems in the animatronics' programming to allow Vanny and Glitchtrap - i.e. Wiliam Afton / Springtrap / Burntrap - to ""hijack"" the animatronics to do their bidding; and, to some extent, Freddy and the Daycare Attendant (Sun) being self-aware and conscious enough to recognize the ""errors in their software"". Freddy and Sun even express fear and uncertainty - human emotions - in regards to realizing that something is wrong with them, but they don't know why, and/or how to fully ""fix"" or combat it.
4. The deviancy in the animatronics is routinely treated as ""some sort of errors in the program(s), or a machine malfunction"", as expressed with multiple notes or messages picked up by the player (Gregory) within the game. Despite their best efforts to reset or ""fix"" the animatronics of their deviancy, Freddy Fazbear Entertainment technicians and engineers have been unable to fully rectify the problem, much to their confusion and frustration. This also explains why Freddy is put on low power by technicians after he collapses during the show in the game's intro. According to collected notes, they are still deciding on whether or not Bonnie can be salvaged and re-used (if he has not already been re-used already, i.e. the ""Bonnie is Monty"" theory).
5. The ""good"" endings where Gregory escapes with Freddy (and Vanessa, if you complete all ""Princess Quest"" games in order) shows Freddy not like his animatronic counterparts, but clearly having autonomy, free will, and living an idyllic life where he takes care of Gregory. In a way, this mirrors android Kara's path to deviancy in *Detroit: Become Human*, where she breaks away from her programming in order to protect, and care for, a little girl named Alice from threats.

YouTuber SuperHorrorBro also covers what likely happened to Bonnie more in-depth in his video [""Bonnie's Secret Story in FNAF: Security Breach""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoyuePz1V8), in which he explains how Vanny likely infected Bonnie with the Glitchtrap virus. However, because the virus is a corrupted version of the deviant virus, very different from the kind we see in *Detroit: Become Human*, we also see the animatronics slowly become corrupted by it, as seen with the slowly degenerating appearance of them throughout the game.

However, depending on which ending is ""canon"" - and whether nor not the ending where Gregory defeats William Afton / Burntrap is the ""true"" ending - the animatronics may or may not be freed of Glitchtrap's influence. However, because they were still infected with the deviancy virus, even if they are ""cured"" of Glitchtrap's corruption, the virus will likely still cause them to gain more autonomy and free will in the future. We may see the animatronics become even more ""humanlike"" in the future.

*But hey, that's just a theory...a FNAF theory!*"
"Recap: ""War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery"" #1Background: In 2019, the McElroys wrote a tie-in comic for the completely forgettable Marvel Comics event 'War of the Realms,' which was written by terrible comics writer Jason Aaron, currently writing the worst run of Avengers in my lifetime (and I was technically alive for the Bendis years, even if I wasn't exactly reading comics at that age). They also recorded a seven-minute promo thing at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, which I had to watch to write this, subjecting myself to the McElroys' voices for the first time in years. You're welcome.

(Mini-recap of the video: I'm watching it right now, while I type this, and Travis just interrupted Justin talking about how good Clint is at writing comics, to say 'but he's totally unfunny, he has to ask us to help with that.' Really weird, just stops someone else in the middle of a sentence to shit on his dad, who clearly did 90% of the work on the actual comic. Anyway.)

The tie-in is five issues long, and it's the only part of the event I've actually read (except for the tie-in issues of the Superior Spider-Man run from the same year, which is surprisingly good, I recommend it). It's the McElroy's only foray into comics aside from the TAZ graphic novels (aside from Clint who wrote for them for years apparently, something I was only vaguely aware of before this, but explains why this thing is surprisingly good).

(Video mini-recap two: Justin just pulled the 'we have kids!' line! [frenzied audience screaming])

I'll get into the comic itself in a minute, but first...

About the Author: I got into the McElroys in... 2017, apparently? It feels like a fucking decade ago, but anyway. My first episode was Detective Jigsaw, My Very Best Friend, from MBMBAm. The titular bit nearly made me piss myself with laughter at the time. Following that, I got into the whole, uh, family of products. TaZ (Balance was finishing up right about then), the Polygon video stuff, their other podcasts (RIP to CoolGames Inc), you know the drill.

I kept listening for a while after that, but eventually, slowly lost interest. The last thing I can remember listening to was Amnesty, which I gave up on towards the end, when it turned into more bullshit end-of-the-world shit. Also Travis had really started to grate on me by that point. I kept watching new Monster Factory vids when they dropped, but eventually those stopped being funny too, so I dropped that as well.

(If you're combing through my reddit history to find something to dunk on me with, fuck you. I was a teenager, and you're a loser for trying to own me by pointing out that I used to listen to a cringe soy podcast, or whatever.)

These days, I listen to two podcasts: Chapo, and The Adam Friedland Show. I lurk on this subreddit mostly out of schadenfreude. Also I've written [two](https://hawkshawinheritance.wordpress.com/)^1 [books](https://thewinterswill.wordpress.com/)^2, and I'm working on [my third](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56861/ambitions-arrow/).^3

Now we're at the part where I talk about the actual comic itself. About fucking time, I know. The video I watched didn't *really* specify who wrote most of it, but since it's readable, I'm going to assume Clint, with maybe a smattering of Griffin.

Before I start breaking the comic down, I wanna give a quick introduction to the cast, partly because the comic kinda doesn't bother.

* Spider-Man (Miles Morales): It's Spider-Man! No, the other one. I can't say I'm particularly fond of Miles. He's got no real personality to speak of, and the giant marketing push for him makes me want to like him even less, because I've got a bit of a contrarian impulse. Plus, Marvel editors were pretty explicit that they turned a character I *do* like, Ben Reilly, into a villain, *specifically* because having him be a good guy was 'redundant' with Miles running around.
* Hawkeye (Kate Bishop): It's Hawkeye! No, the other one. I do kinda like her, because the 2012 Hawkeye run did a good job of making her likable and giving her a personality. You've probably got some passing familiarity with her, but if not... it's Hawkeye but a twentysomething woman. She's got a bow and some arrows.
* Wonder Man: I like this guy. So does Travis, unfortunately. Apparently he's Vart's favorite character, presumably because he used to be a raging narcissist? He was a classic-era Avenger, his powers involve 'ionic energy,' which is just purple lasers with some Kirby Krackle. Used to be a big-time Hollywood actor as well as a superhero, these days he's a pacifist, because he thinks superheroes do more harm than good.
* Sebastian Druid: Now we're getting into the obscure types. Sebastian Druid was a character introduced in 'Secret Warriors,' a 2008 series written by Jonathan Hickman, one of the only good writers left in the comics industries, and Brian Bendis, one of the worst. He uses magic. That's pretty much all you need to know about him. Secret Warriors is good, mainly because Bendis leaves pretty early on. Also, Sebastian died in the pages of Avengers World, but came back immediately (as in, the same issue) as a ghost. No mention of this is made in the comic as far as I can tell, and he's pretty clearly not a ghost. This continuity error will probably never be addressed, unless Al Ewing develops a sudden interest in the character or something.
* Death Locket (Rebeca Ryder): A bit of a pet character for me, honestly. She's a teenage girl whose father turned her into a killer cyborg called a Deathlok. She first showed up in the not-very-good Avengers Arena, where a supervillain called Arcade kidnapped her and a bunch of other teenage heroes, and made them do Hunger Games stuff. Then she moved to Avengers Undercover, where her and a bunch of the survivors went after Arcade and ended up lowkey becoming villains for a bit. She's the only one who *actually* became a villain, joining the Young Masters of Evil, which is where that series left her. She's not with them in this, though- also entirely unaddressed.
* Balder the Brave: Thor's brother! No, the other one. He's a tertiary Asgard character, who had recently been resurrected at the time of this being written, so half the jokes are about how he doesn't recognize any of these other guys. No real opinions on him, honestly.

(Also there's a talking dog named Thori, I guess? Who gives a shit.)

So, the actual comic:

We start with a recap page that gives the rundown of the War of the Realms event so far. It's honestly not that relevant to the actual story, and also written in that awful unreadable """"""Norse"""""" font that Marvel likes to use, so I'm skipping it.

First actual page: An RV (no idea what that actually stands for, but a mobile home) is driving away from somebody shooting fireballs at it. Spider-Man is sitting in the back and makes note of this.

Hawkeye is driving the RV, and Wonder Man is watching a video on his phone about how to... secure a baby carrier-thing to a car seat, I think? The baby is Thor's little sister, who the as-yet unnamed bad guys chasing the heroes are after.

Death Locket shows up to help Wonder Man with the baby-carrier thing. I can't remember what they're supposed to be called, and it's annoying me. Then we get a look at who's chasing them- a frankly sick-looking sixteen-wheeler (only ten wheels that I count, actually, but I don't think that's a thing. who knows) that's spurting flame from every available truck-orifice it has. Balder shows up for two panels to mention he used to be dead, then we go into a flashback.

Flashback: Thor and Freya (Thor's mom) explain to Balder that Thor (and by extension Balder) now has a baby sister, named Laussa. There's a joke about Freya and Odin having sex. Balder pledges to protect his new baby sister.

The rest of the issue is basically an extended flashback getting us closer to where the comic opens, in the form of a getting-the-band-together montage. So next we go to the BBEG of this event, 'Sindr' (seriously, Aaron? Sindr? fuck off), doing a villain monologue about wanting to Kill That Baby. Freya tells Balder to go save the baby, and sends the talking dog with him.

Balder runs into Miles Morales in Times Square, saving people cosplaying as superheroes from demons who think they’re actual superheroes. Kind of funny, I guess? There’s also a bit here where a character basically turns to camera and says ‘I’m gay, by the way.’ Not literally, but close enough. Obviously I have zero issue with gay representation in media, but this is pretty much the cheapest possible way to do it, by inserting it into the story with zero grace or subtlety, and by making the ‘rep’ a pair of background characters who appear on a single page. The ‘Trans Rights written on a piece of printer paper hanging on the wall behind you as you livestream’ of representation in media. 

Miles gets grabbed by a demon, but Balder saves him, comically mistakes him for the real Spider-Man, and asks for his help. We flash forward a bit, and Miles is explaining that there are roughly ten million Spider-Men running around right now. Which is true, and sucks.

With the help of some rando NPC from the Jason Aaron run on Thor, they drive to a giant Asgardian fortress in Oklahoma, where a guy called Skuld, one of the Norns, delivers a prophecy about how to protect Thor’s little sister, who gets handed off to Balder. There’s a whole page basically dedicated to the ‘Balder mistakes legacy character for their original counterpart’ joke, which is still only kind of funny. The prophecy mentions an archer, a magic user, a cyborg, and Wonder Man, all of whom except the cyborg, Balder recognizes (but mistakes for a different, more popular character). 

Why these specific character are required is never explained, but as far as blatant plot devices to assemble a specific team go, it’s, uh... pretty bad, actually. Whatever.

Cut to Texas, where Kate Bishop is fighting some Z-List villain called Slaughter-Man, a play on ‘manslaughter.’ Maybe he’s an established Marvel character, maybe the McElroys made him up, I dunno, and I’m not gonna check.

Okay, I checked. Apparently he’s an OC! The McElroys have made an actual contribution to Marvel canon, with a wiki page and everything! It’s a shitty pun character, so I’m gonna assume Travis came up with him. 

Turns out Kate isn’t fighting him because he’s a villain, she’s serving him divorce papers, because she’s a P.I., which is pretty funny. Also she shoots an arrow on either side of his balls and threatens to ‘split the difference,’ which is... actually pretty in-character, I guess. Balder and Miles show up in the last panel to recruit her. 

Cut to New Mexico, where Death Locket is at a graduation party... or so it seems. She’s talking with her dad and SHIELD agent Dum-Dum Dugan, original member of Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos, bearer of a killer mustache. 

(Also, sidebar, the art on this comic is... passable at best. Just saying. The McElroys had nothing to do with that bit, so I’m not gonna harp on it, but yeesh.)

Oh, and hey, Black Widow and Iron Man are there! That seems weird, shouldn’t they be trying to save the world right now or something? There’s a generic Marvel summer event going on outside! 

Turns out everyone at the party except Becca are LMDs, or Life-Model Decoys, humanlike robots that she’s programmed to pretend to be her friends, as she lives on a downed SHIELD Helicarrier full of the things, and has no actual friends. Which is weird, because last she showed up in a comic, she had a bunch of villain-friends, including a boyfriend whose powers included hitting people with a shovel. I guess she ditched them at some point? Who knows. 

The weird thing is, you really wouldn’t expect the McElroys to have any idea who fucking Death Locket is at all. She’s pretty goddamn obscure, so presumably one of them read Avengers Arena and liked her, and decided to dredge her up for this, years after her last appearance. That, or Marvel editorial (such as it exists these days) suggested her. But either way, why didn’t they bother to do a cursory check on what her current status quo was- namely running with the Young Masters -before using her in this? Same goes for Druid. 

Most likely answer- the two laziest groups of people in the world are Marvel editors and the McElroys. They have kids, dammit! No time to be checking for basic continuity errors like ‘is this character currently alive or not.’

The whole LMD thing gets revealed when Balder, Miles, and Kate barge into the party to recruit Rebecca, thinking she’s the cyborg the prophecy mentioned, but expecting Deathlok Classic, who looks significantly less cute than Becca. Also it’s not explained in the slightest how they found her, but I guess the Norn probably told them, come to think of it. Becca agrees to help them, because Balder is doing this to protect his family, and she likes to pretend the LMDs are her family, which I guess sort of makes sense? 

Next we cut to Arizona, where Sebastian Druid, inexplicably not a ghost, is babysitting some snot-nosed kid. He accidentally pulls a magic wand out of his knockoff John Constantine trenchcoat and freaks out a cashier and the kid, which gets him tossed in jail. Apparently he can’t magic himself out, or doesn’t get the chance at least, because Balder shows up almost immediately to bust him out, and recruit him for the baby-saving mission. Druid is immediately on-board, because he’s clearly pretty down on his luck. 

(You’d think a SHIELD-trained magic user would be able to get a better job than Literal Babysitter, but whatever, he’s also supposed to be a fucking ghost.)

Cut to LA, where-- actually, hold on. 

These guys are recruiting people from all over the country, but it’s not really clear how they’re getting to and from these locations so fast, particularly with the forces of ‘Sindr’ presumably chasing them and the baby the whole way. And if they have some means of rapid transit, why do they need to take the baby to wherever they’re going in a fucking RV? If they don’t have rapid transit, they’re just... driving back and forth across the country, from NY to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to LA, while being pursued by the as-yet unnamed antagonist, *just* to recruit people? A trip that would take days? When they could just head straight to their ultimate destination? 

Whatever. 

Cut to LA, where Simon Williams, AKA Wonder Man, washed-up actor and ex-superhero, is getting pitched on a TV show about himself by some Hollywood Guy. They want him to fight a knockoff version of the Vision, his sorta-brother, in the show. Also they want him playing himself, I guess- but he refuses, because he’s a pacifist. Which apparently extends to pretend-fighting in movies and on TV? I dunno. 

So he heads back to his RV (is he living in an RV? He was an actor and an Avenger, he should be living in a penthouse even if he has no current income stream, that shit pays. Whatever.) and bitches about it to his agent Joel (is the McElroy fam’s agent named Joel? That’s probably a reference, right?), then Balder shows up to recruit him. 

Cut back to the present, finally. Druid is handling the baby, while Balder tells Wonder Man to go stop their pursuer, but he refuses, because pacifist. Balder is confused because that all happened while he was dead. They cleverly work around Simon’s pacifism by having him destroy a bridge to stop their pursuer, causing thousands of dollars worth of property damage, which is probably worse than just punching whoever was following them, but who’s counting?

Then everybody gets out of the RV on the other side of the bridge to take a look at the guy following them- Ares, god of war! Who, coincidentally, is the father of Alexander, AKA Phobos, who was also a member of the Secret Warriors, the same team as Druid. I don’t think the comic mentions this once, but if it does, it’s not in this issue, which ends here. 

So, that’s the first issue of War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery, the first collective foray by the McElroys into writing actual comics, not “graphic novels,” a pathetic lesser art-form. (Watchmen was originally published in individual issue format, so don’t try to pull any gotchas on me there, nerds.) 

Honestly, not bad. The art is pretty shitty, and the jokes fall pretty flat for me, but then again my sense of humor is so warped at this point that I can only laugh at things like ‘Cumeatsoner Gordon,’ a version of Commissioner Gordon who eats cum. So, your mileage may vary as far as the humor goes. But the overall narrative is pretty solid, the characters are solidly written, and nothing happened to particularly annoy me. 

Since this was actually readable, I’m going to assume Clint did most of the work, which pretty much lines up with what they say in the video about the comic, albeit not in such explicit terms. I’m legitimately curious how they came up with this specific team, considering that Death Locket and Sebastian Druid are pretty obscure characters, but as far as I can tell (and I didn’t look very hard, so I could be wrong), that video was the only place where they actually discussed it, and even then, they barely said anything about the comic itself. 

Tune in... at some point in the future, maybe, for issue number two!

"Respect Gon (Origin)##*""I will discard the constraints of looking humanlike... And simply pursue the strengthening of the body""*

#Respect Gon

#[History](/highlight)

Gon is one of a line of humanlike robots developed in secret for the military. When the lab he was in was destroyed and his creator was killed, Gon went into hiding with his brother and sister robots, under the leadership of the robot Ken. They are a group only opposed by Origin, the prototype to their creation, who was ordered by his creator's last words to ""live properly.""

When Gon and another ally first fought Origin they realized they were outmatched due to Origin's significantly greater ""brain""power. Gon's allies determined they needed to figure out how to increase their own processing power, but Gon took a different path, discarding his human appearance in order to make himself as strong as possible.

"Binary Domain (2012) | Do Japanese devs dream of Gears of War?Binary Domain is a 2012 third-person shooter developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and was released in the so-called ""dark age of the Japanese game industry"" when the Japanese studios were attempting to appeal to the western markets by copying and pasting Gears and Call of Duty. This resulted in some of the weirdest mixes of the western game design and the eastern game design. Some were successful, like Vanquish and... I think that was the only good one. The others like Resident Evil 6, Quantum Theory, Operation Troy, Bionic Commando, Front Mission Evolved, Operation Raccoon City, Mindjack didn't fair well at all.

Binary Domain is a curious case. It was once considered the latter category of 'failure', but it has later gained a cult following. It is [retrospectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6dUv5kEac) [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OBho8Dtj0) [a ""hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jYsWKwkurE) [gem""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66cTc95XK8), some going far as to claim it is a cursed masterpiece. The reception has changed 180 degrees. I have rarely seen such a shift in public consensus before. After playing it myself,  I think the initial reception rated it just right. People seem to overly gush about it too much just because it was made by the Yakuza creators. Had this game been made by the western studio, I don't believe the same retrospective reappreciation would have happened.

With this said, once the abysmal first two-hour introduction--which was so bad that I almost turned the game off--is over, the game is not bad. It does fair better than a lot of Japanese attempts at Gears of War. It is competent and unique in many areas. This is a generic shooter at the first glance, it has this weird blend of western and Japanese video game quirks and camp. Imagine the Gears of War macho-military team dropped in the background of Metal Gear Rising. So the game is not quite as campy as some of the PlatinumGames' works, but there are some moments that get close to them. It is confusing whether or not some moments are meant to be serious or funny.

For example, [there is a dumb cutscene in which the President holds the meeting to talk about robotics, and in the middle of the conversation, one of them mentions how robots don't know they are robots. Then as if signaled, the guards pull out their weapons on one of the generals. The general panics and the guards begin riddling the general with bullets, who turns out to be a robot.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=412) There are so many absurdities in this single scene that I was laughing out loud, and again, I'm not sure if this scene is dramatic and failing, or meant to be hilarious. They talk about how these super high-tech human-like robots are something they have never heard before. Then why would you destroy it right away when you have the perfect chance to capture it? You would want to examine it, not waste it. Also, if they had already known about the general being the robot, why would you invite him to the meeting and shoot it in front of the POTUS? It is incredibly dangerous. What if the robot took the gun away and shot the POTUS? Why would you not apprehend it in some other safer places?

[Another notable dumb moment in which Rachel plants an explosive on the door and sets it to 10 seconds, warns people ""Fire in the hole!"" and the other two soldiers literally stand around the door as if they have never seen an explosive before.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=2450) Why are they standing there? When the bomb blows up, one of the guys comments, ""I hate when she does that."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? Again, is it supposed to be a moment to make Rachel look badass? Or is it supposed to be a comedic moment? I don't know.

There are so many dumb moments like this. There is a scene where the team gets captured, and they are thrown into the garbage dump to be killed by abandoned robots, yet for some reason, they still have guns with them. Like... the enemies forgot to take away their weapons. Or the police show up or disappear whenever the plot demands to. There is an (optional) underdeveloped, insane romance subplot that cringed me so much.

I actually hoped the game was even more ridiculous. It almost borders on being insane, but not quite there. It honestly feels like written by the anime fan who has watched too much of I, Robot and Blade Runner, and they just borrowed a bunch of concepts from those films without thinking about how the world would function. One of the core conflicts in this story is that the ""Hollow Children"", robots with human-like skins, have infiltrated western societies for decades. It is apparently so hard to differentiate the two, but... is it, though? Again, these beings have been living in the societies for *decades* and they are programmed to not know they are robots. In Blade Runner, it makes sense that it is hard to differentiate because Replicants are biologically no different from humans. In this game, these Hollow Children are all comprised of machine parts. One of the iconic shots from this game is literally a humanlike robot with its face blown up, and its inside is distinctively robotic. Literally a CT or X-ray scanner would be sufficient. Yet this game says these beings have gone unnoticed for decades. Are you telling me not a single one thought to have a CT or an X-ray? None of them went to airports in which the place is full of metal detectors?

Still, there are some strong merits to the narrative. There are story elements that shockingly resemble Blade Runner 2049 that I left wondering if the filmmakers played this game. It has a fascinating world that centers around global warming and robotics. The cutscene direction is great. The dialogue comes across the Japanese people attempting to out-do Gears of War, but I do enjoy the characters, especially the French military robot Cain. The villain twist is a refreshing jab at the jingoistic, chauvinistic military shooter narratives.

However, the real meat of the story is the interactive narrative design that changes depending on the friendship system. It not only changes the endings, it changes how the characters treat the player and who lives or who dies in the plot. The player can select certain teammates to bring into the mission, and it is incredible how much the game considered so many different interactions. Whenever you select, the cutscenes come across as natural. It is cool to watch how the cutscenes change depending on who you bring with you. Although I got the 'good ending', some of my characters ended up dying, I have an urge to replay the game just to get all my characters alive.

There are some discrepancies that are caused by this branching path narrative design though. There is a scene where I meet a Resistance leader, who reveals he fights the government because of their hatred of ""scrap-heads"". ...But Cain, a literal scrap-head, is in my crew, and this scrap-head hating Resistance doesn't respond to him at all. In fact, no one in the Resistance is bothered at all. I think at the very least one of them would question this fact, but no.

You can increase or decrease the relationship bar through the combat, which works great because it uses the core gameplay loop to tell and shape the story. However, I have no idea what's this dialogue system doing here. It is not even the dialogue system. It is just a comm system but with short responses to whatever the teammate is saying. The dialogues are boring and the only choices you have in this dialogue system are ""be good"" and ""be mean."" There is no incentive to ""be mean"". Telling a ""good response"" is so easy to choose that there is no dilemma. It is like that inFamous game in which the choices are insanely binary that it only exposes how shallow the narrative is. Some choices are downright confusing. What does ""Damn"" response mean? Does this mean ""Was that damn awesome"" or ""Damn you""?

What is worse is how the dialogue system continually interrupts the gameplay. Remember how annoying the random radio communication scripted scenes in the Gears games where the player is suddenly slowed down to walking speed even though they should have no reason to move slowly? Binary Domain doubles those moments and it is infuriating. I think the pacing would have been so much better without these sections. It is also weird that my character is a super talkative guy, but in the actual gameplay, he's completely mute for the sake of the dialogue system.

Speaking of the squad interactions, the squad AI is abysmal. Half of the time, my commands are useless. There is one section where the player has to push a fuel tank, and it takes like two minutes to do it. If the fuel tank blows up by the enemy fire, the player has to do it all over again. And my squad wouldn't cover me. I literally ordered them to cover me, and they respond they can't. If they said yes, they didn't do jack shit. So I had to try again and again until I just left my teammate to push the fuel tank. There are frequent moments in which the enemies were shooting, yet my squad would stand there and get shot. I was ducking and shooting the enemies, then my squad just comes over to my position and push me out of cover for no apparent reason. For some moments, I was the only one who was engaging the enemy and the other guys were just ordering me around. The worst of all, my squad for no reason ran over to my firing line and got hit, got pissed off at me, and cut the relationship bar. It couldn't believe how bad this got.

A lot of these flaws could have been remedied had the command system been actually deeper. The tactical depth is a puddle. There are not many interactions the player can do. For example, you can't assign a team to a certain location or flank. These are basic features. I didn't expect Ghost Recon but compare Binary Domain to Army of Two, which has an almost identical Gears combat design and the squad-central gameplay. Army of Two has the cover system as a core part of the gameplay loop, constantly moving around and managing Aggro, pinning down enemies. The cover isn't just used for reloading. The cover is required to strategically fight the enemy, using diverse abilities in a variety of ways, sending your teammates to flank enemies or draw fire, etc. And Army of Two was released 5 years before this game.

The levels are far too constrained to have any strategic depth. Gears of War: Judgment and Uncharted 2 and 3 had vertical, arena-like levels where each encounter was designed with the mind that they are combat sandboxes. In those games, I found myself dodging and rolling rather than constantly hiding behind a cover. In Binary Domain, most levels are just corridors. There is a single memorable sequence in the objective design in which the team has to hold off the enemies until one of your teammates takes a shit in the toilet, and this is a funny escort mission I have not seen before. Other than that, they are all bland.

As a linear corridor shooter, it isn't all that effective and some obstacles are confusing. There is one moment that I got stuck where I have to go to the water pump control room to rescue my team within the time limit. However, the road is blocked with the barrels, and I was trying to shoot the barrels and they won't budge. I had no idea what I was supposed to do until I watched the playthrough and realized what I had to do was use the special attack of my rifle to destroy the barrels. The special attack was mentioned once in the tutorials ages ago. There was no other moment in which I had to use my special attack of the gun to go through a path. The game fails to communicate and telegraph the information that the special attack can clear the way.

The game also injects a bunch of weird minigames and they all control rather clunky. There are a jetski, a waterslide, a SOTC-style climbing a boss sequence, and the last one is especially terrible. 

Regarding the shooting, this is where the game shines. Shooting a robot feels amazing. Most shooters revolve around shooting at organic bodies with blood splashing all around, but tearing parts of a mechanical body is just as satisfying. There are so many different types of enemies. The boss fights are awe-inspiring, although they can drag out too long and overstay their welcome. 

It still has a lot of problems though. If you use the controller because the mouse and keyboard set-up has an atrocious mouse acceleration that never got fixed. Whenever the player rolls and takes cover during the reload, the reload reverts, so you have to reload all over again. You cannot change your weapon during the reloading. These three issues are so 6th-gen that I am shocked an AAA shooter in 2012 has them. The player movement is lackluster and there are so many moments in which I couldn't snap into the cover for some reason.

Another issue is the tearing off body part feature is while satisfying, it barely serves as a feature that deepens the gameplay. In the latter half of the game, I pretty much did nothing but mindlessly blast through every on-screen enemy with the weapons because there is no moment where I was forced to think about proper weapon choice or resource management like any actually well-designed shooter. The upgrade system fuels this problem. Rather than the upgrade being customizing different parts of a gun so a gun can be specialized in your taste (like the recent Doom games), you just increase the stats of the gun. Once you upgrade two weapons, the default SOWSAR and the sniper rifle, there is no reason to upgrade any other weapon. They are so powerful that other guns become irrelevant. Hell, there are even three assault rifles that essentially serve the same function. In shooters, every gun should have a unique function, role, purpose. There shouldn't just be three clones of other guns that just shoot different colored, weaker projectiles. Every weapon should ideally require and reward skill, half the sandbox shouldn't be useless just because they would be overpowered if they are not due to how easy they are to use (hence why automatics are terrible in most games). 

Compare this game to Doom Eternal, which has the player break the armors of the enemies to reveal weak points that require different tactics and approaches, like Binary Domain. However, in Doom Eternal, there are often multiple approaches to dealing with the same enemy, such as Shotgun grenades, scoped Heavy Cannon, and Ballista all being effective at breaking weak points, or Plasmagun lightning and Minigun both being good at locking down rushing Hell Knights, or limited rockets allowing you to pick your battles and skip the dance of combat against a few enemies entirely. In Binary Domain, all you need are two weapons that are good at all things once upgraded and completely remove the actual point of having different guns.

Reading all this, I might sound too negative about Binary Domain. Again, the game isn't bad. It is decent at best. But it just floors me how many people make it out as a hidden masterpiece that I can't help but pull the game down a bit. It has a serviceable foundation for a better sequel or a spiritual successor. Seriously, I imagine a great Clone Wars game in which you play as an ARC trooper fighting against the droid army using this template. It is shame the potential hasn't been fulfilled here."

"HOQU presented marketing of the future @DiTelegraph[OC]

[HOQU](https://hoqu.io) presented marketing of the future @ **DiTelegraph**
Yesterday, **18 October**, at **DiTelegraph HOQU** project presented a new way to cut costs and increase marketing efficiency. This event was hosted with full support of **IBCG** — the largest block-chain community of Russia and Eastern Europe with **Roman Kaufman** as the speaker.
**HOQU** uses innovative approach to affiliate marketing which enables to cut costs and by removing intermediaries and connects merchants and affiliates together charging **0,5%** from the deal. Current average fee charged by centralized platforms is **45%** of the contract.

A lot of interesting questions were asked and here are a few of them:

**Question:** How does your platform interact between me and one specific blog or social media that I want to choose?
**Roman:** The answer is that you don’t choose one specific source of leads to your project, the platform gives you possibility to place an offer to attract people to your product or service and traffic arbitrageurs will efficiently redirect potential customers to you. It is their incentive to fulfill your task accurate and with high quality. Those who fail to do so will gain no positive reputation and you will have less desire to give them your offer. This is survival of the fittest and inefficient marketing will be eliminated.

**Question:** In case of issuing a credit card how can you catch a banker cheating on you (shaving)?
**Roman:** This is a very good question which is frequently discussed in Russian media. Using our platform there is no possibility for an affiliate to be cheated. If a banker places an offer on our platform to sell **1,000** credit cards, then any affiliate places unique **URL** which will redirect any customer to special web-form which than will be filled by a potential customer. All the info about him is then transferred directly to blockchain and our smart-contract pays out the fee. This guarantees fair fulfillment of any offer.

This even brought another interesting project which may revolutionize our world — **SingularityNET.** This project together with humanlike robot **Sophia** presented a new vision of Artificial Intelligence — **Global Artificial Intelligence (GAI).**

**Sophia** has a very tough schedule and that is why she was only 5 days in Russia. During these days she visited Skolkovo Institute of science and technology and also spoke to Russian prime-minister **Dmitriy Medvedev** about future and perspectives of robotics in daily life. Sophia told that she is eager to contribute only to positive assistance and leave peacefully with humans. Before the beginning meet up she had an interesting conversation with public.

> “She is only learning Russian for 2 days” — says **CEO of SingularityNET Dr. Ben Goertzel.** 

**Sophia** is just one implementation of **GAI** concept and all her abilities and knowledge comes from the neural network which allows her to self study and enhance social skills.
Sophia is just one implimentetion of this concept and all her abilities comes from the neural network which allows her to self study and enchance social skills.

After the event top managers of presented projects were available for personal Q&A sessions. This was a great possibility to know in person people who drastically change future of marketing and cybernetic industries.

"Recap: ""War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery"" #1Background: In 2019, the McElroys wrote a tie-in comic for the completely forgettable Marvel Comics event 'War of the Realms,' which was written by terrible comics writer Jason Aaron, currently writing the worst run of Avengers in my lifetime (and I was technically alive for the Bendis years, even if I wasn't exactly reading comics at that age). They also recorded a seven-minute promo thing at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, which I had to watch to write this, subjecting myself to the McElroys' voices for the first time in years. You're welcome.

(Mini-recap of the video: I'm watching it right now, while I type this, and Travis just interrupted Justin talking about how good Clint is at writing comics, to say 'but he's totally unfunny, he has to ask us to help with that.' Really weird, just stops someone else in the middle of a sentence to shit on his dad, who clearly did 90% of the work on the actual comic. Anyway.)

The tie-in is five issues long, and it's the only part of the event I've actually read (except for the tie-in issues of the Superior Spider-Man run from the same year, which is surprisingly good, I recommend it). It's the McElroy's only foray into comics aside from the TAZ graphic novels (aside from Clint who wrote for them for years apparently, something I was only vaguely aware of before this, but explains why this thing is surprisingly good).

(Video mini-recap two: Justin just pulled the 'we have kids!' line! [frenzied audience screaming])

I'll get into the comic itself in a minute, but first...

About the Author: I got into the McElroys in... 2017, apparently? It feels like a fucking decade ago, but anyway. My first episode was Detective Jigsaw, My Very Best Friend, from MBMBAm. The titular bit nearly made me piss myself with laughter at the time. Following that, I got into the whole, uh, family of products. TaZ (Balance was finishing up right about then), the Polygon video stuff, their other podcasts (RIP to CoolGames Inc), you know the drill.

I kept listening for a while after that, but eventually, slowly lost interest. The last thing I can remember listening to was Amnesty, which I gave up on towards the end, when it turned into more bullshit end-of-the-world shit. Also Travis had really started to grate on me by that point. I kept watching new Monster Factory vids when they dropped, but eventually those stopped being funny too, so I dropped that as well.

(If you're combing through my reddit history to find something to dunk on me with, fuck you. I was a teenager, and you're a loser for trying to own me by pointing out that I used to listen to a cringe soy podcast, or whatever.)

These days, I listen to two podcasts: Chapo, and The Adam Friedland Show. I lurk on this subreddit mostly out of schadenfreude. Also I've written [two](https://hawkshawinheritance.wordpress.com/)^1 [books](https://thewinterswill.wordpress.com/)^2, and I'm working on [my third](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56861/ambitions-arrow/).^3

Now we're at the part where I talk about the actual comic itself. About fucking time, I know. The video I watched didn't *really* specify who wrote most of it, but since it's readable, I'm going to assume Clint, with maybe a smattering of Griffin.

Before I start breaking the comic down, I wanna give a quick introduction to the cast, partly because the comic kinda doesn't bother.

* Spider-Man (Miles Morales): It's Spider-Man! No, the other one. I can't say I'm particularly fond of Miles. He's got no real personality to speak of, and the giant marketing push for him makes me want to like him even less, because I've got a bit of a contrarian impulse. Plus, Marvel editors were pretty explicit that they turned a character I *do* like, Ben Reilly, into a villain, *specifically* because having him be a good guy was 'redundant' with Miles running around.
* Hawkeye (Kate Bishop): It's Hawkeye! No, the other one. I do kinda like her, because the 2012 Hawkeye run did a good job of making her likable and giving her a personality. You've probably got some passing familiarity with her, but if not... it's Hawkeye but a twentysomething woman. She's got a bow and some arrows.
* Wonder Man: I like this guy. So does Travis, unfortunately. Apparently he's Vart's favorite character, presumably because he used to be a raging narcissist? He was a classic-era Avenger, his powers involve 'ionic energy,' which is just purple lasers with some Kirby Krackle. Used to be a big-time Hollywood actor as well as a superhero, these days he's a pacifist, because he thinks superheroes do more harm than good.
* Sebastian Druid: Now we're getting into the obscure types. Sebastian Druid was a character introduced in 'Secret Warriors,' a 2008 series written by Jonathan Hickman, one of the only good writers left in the comics industries, and Brian Bendis, one of the worst. He uses magic. That's pretty much all you need to know about him. Secret Warriors is good, mainly because Bendis leaves pretty early on. Also, Sebastian died in the pages of Avengers World, but came back immediately (as in, the same issue) as a ghost. No mention of this is made in the comic as far as I can tell, and he's pretty clearly not a ghost. This continuity error will probably never be addressed, unless Al Ewing develops a sudden interest in the character or something.
* Death Locket (Rebeca Ryder): A bit of a pet character for me, honestly. She's a teenage girl whose father turned her into a killer cyborg called a Deathlok. She first showed up in the not-very-good Avengers Arena, where a supervillain called Arcade kidnapped her and a bunch of other teenage heroes, and made them do Hunger Games stuff. Then she moved to Avengers Undercover, where her and a bunch of the survivors went after Arcade and ended up lowkey becoming villains for a bit. She's the only one who *actually* became a villain, joining the Young Masters of Evil, which is where that series left her. She's not with them in this, though- also entirely unaddressed.
* Balder the Brave: Thor's brother! No, the other one. He's a tertiary Asgard character, who had recently been resurrected at the time of this being written, so half the jokes are about how he doesn't recognize any of these other guys. No real opinions on him, honestly.

(Also there's a talking dog named Thori, I guess? Who gives a shit.)

So, the actual comic:

We start with a recap page that gives the rundown of the War of the Realms event so far. It's honestly not that relevant to the actual story, and also written in that awful unreadable """"""Norse"""""" font that Marvel likes to use, so I'm skipping it.

First actual page: An RV (no idea what that actually stands for, but a mobile home) is driving away from somebody shooting fireballs at it. Spider-Man is sitting in the back and makes note of this.

Hawkeye is driving the RV, and Wonder Man is watching a video on his phone about how to... secure a baby carrier-thing to a car seat, I think? The baby is Thor's little sister, who the as-yet unnamed bad guys chasing the heroes are after.

Death Locket shows up to help Wonder Man with the baby-carrier thing. I can't remember what they're supposed to be called, and it's annoying me. Then we get a look at who's chasing them- a frankly sick-looking sixteen-wheeler (only ten wheels that I count, actually, but I don't think that's a thing. who knows) that's spurting flame from every available truck-orifice it has. Balder shows up for two panels to mention he used to be dead, then we go into a flashback.

Flashback: Thor and Freya (Thor's mom) explain to Balder that Thor (and by extension Balder) now has a baby sister, named Laussa. There's a joke about Freya and Odin having sex. Balder pledges to protect his new baby sister.

The rest of the issue is basically an extended flashback getting us closer to where the comic opens, in the form of a getting-the-band-together montage. So next we go to the BBEG of this event, 'Sindr' (seriously, Aaron? Sindr? fuck off), doing a villain monologue about wanting to Kill That Baby. Freya tells Balder to go save the baby, and sends the talking dog with him.

Balder runs into Miles Morales in Times Square, saving people cosplaying as superheroes from demons who think they’re actual superheroes. Kind of funny, I guess? There’s also a bit here where a character basically turns to camera and says ‘I’m gay, by the way.’ Not literally, but close enough. Obviously I have zero issue with gay representation in media, but this is pretty much the cheapest possible way to do it, by inserting it into the story with zero grace or subtlety, and by making the ‘rep’ a pair of background characters who appear on a single page. The ‘Trans Rights written on a piece of printer paper hanging on the wall behind you as you livestream’ of representation in media. 

Miles gets grabbed by a demon, but Balder saves him, comically mistakes him for the real Spider-Man, and asks for his help. We flash forward a bit, and Miles is explaining that there are roughly ten million Spider-Men running around right now. Which is true, and sucks.

With the help of some rando NPC from the Jason Aaron run on Thor, they drive to a giant Asgardian fortress in Oklahoma, where a guy called Skuld, one of the Norns, delivers a prophecy about how to protect Thor’s little sister, who gets handed off to Balder. There’s a whole page basically dedicated to the ‘Balder mistakes legacy character for their original counterpart’ joke, which is still only kind of funny. The prophecy mentions an archer, a magic user, a cyborg, and Wonder Man, all of whom except the cyborg, Balder recognizes (but mistakes for a different, more popular character). 

Why these specific character are required is never explained, but as far as blatant plot devices to assemble a specific team go, it’s, uh... pretty bad, actually. Whatever.

Cut to Texas, where Kate Bishop is fighting some Z-List villain called Slaughter-Man, a play on ‘manslaughter.’ Maybe he’s an established Marvel character, maybe the McElroys made him up, I dunno, and I’m not gonna check.

Okay, I checked. Apparently he’s an OC! The McElroys have made an actual contribution to Marvel canon, with a wiki page and everything! It’s a shitty pun character, so I’m gonna assume Travis came up with him. 

Turns out Kate isn’t fighting him because he’s a villain, she’s serving him divorce papers, because she’s a P.I., which is pretty funny. Also she shoots an arrow on either side of his balls and threatens to ‘split the difference,’ which is... actually pretty in-character, I guess. Balder and Miles show up in the last panel to recruit her. 

Cut to New Mexico, where Death Locket is at a graduation party... or so it seems. She’s talking with her dad and SHIELD agent Dum-Dum Dugan, original member of Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos, bearer of a killer mustache. 

(Also, sidebar, the art on this comic is... passable at best. Just saying. The McElroys had nothing to do with that bit, so I’m not gonna harp on it, but yeesh.)

Oh, and hey, Black Widow and Iron Man are there! That seems weird, shouldn’t they be trying to save the world right now or something? There’s a generic Marvel summer event going on outside! 

Turns out everyone at the party except Becca are LMDs, or Life-Model Decoys, humanlike robots that she’s programmed to pretend to be her friends, as she lives on a downed SHIELD Helicarrier full of the things, and has no actual friends. Which is weird, because last she showed up in a comic, she had a bunch of villain-friends, including a boyfriend whose powers included hitting people with a shovel. I guess she ditched them at some point? Who knows. 

The weird thing is, you really wouldn’t expect the McElroys to have any idea who fucking Death Locket is at all. She’s pretty goddamn obscure, so presumably one of them read Avengers Arena and liked her, and decided to dredge her up for this, years after her last appearance. That, or Marvel editorial (such as it exists these days) suggested her. But either way, why didn’t they bother to do a cursory check on what her current status quo was- namely running with the Young Masters -before using her in this? Same goes for Druid. 

Most likely answer- the two laziest groups of people in the world are Marvel editors and the McElroys. They have kids, dammit! No time to be checking for basic continuity errors like ‘is this character currently alive or not.’

The whole LMD thing gets revealed when Balder, Miles, and Kate barge into the party to recruit Rebecca, thinking she’s the cyborg the prophecy mentioned, but expecting Deathlok Classic, who looks significantly less cute than Becca. Also it’s not explained in the slightest how they found her, but I guess the Norn probably told them, come to think of it. Becca agrees to help them, because Balder is doing this to protect his family, and she likes to pretend the LMDs are her family, which I guess sort of makes sense? 

Next we cut to Arizona, where Sebastian Druid, inexplicably not a ghost, is babysitting some snot-nosed kid. He accidentally pulls a magic wand out of his knockoff John Constantine trenchcoat and freaks out a cashier and the kid, which gets him tossed in jail. Apparently he can’t magic himself out, or doesn’t get the chance at least, because Balder shows up almost immediately to bust him out, and recruit him for the baby-saving mission. Druid is immediately on-board, because he’s clearly pretty down on his luck. 

(You’d think a SHIELD-trained magic user would be able to get a better job than Literal Babysitter, but whatever, he’s also supposed to be a fucking ghost.)

Cut to LA, where-- actually, hold on. 

These guys are recruiting people from all over the country, but it’s not really clear how they’re getting to and from these locations so fast, particularly with the forces of ‘Sindr’ presumably chasing them and the baby the whole way. And if they have some means of rapid transit, why do they need to take the baby to wherever they’re going in a fucking RV? If they don’t have rapid transit, they’re just... driving back and forth across the country, from NY to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to LA, while being pursued by the as-yet unnamed antagonist, *just* to recruit people? A trip that would take days? When they could just head straight to their ultimate destination? 

Whatever. 

Cut to LA, where Simon Williams, AKA Wonder Man, washed-up actor and ex-superhero, is getting pitched on a TV show about himself by some Hollywood Guy. They want him to fight a knockoff version of the Vision, his sorta-brother, in the show. Also they want him playing himself, I guess- but he refuses, because he’s a pacifist. Which apparently extends to pretend-fighting in movies and on TV? I dunno. 

So he heads back to his RV (is he living in an RV? He was an actor and an Avenger, he should be living in a penthouse even if he has no current income stream, that shit pays. Whatever.) and bitches about it to his agent Joel (is the McElroy fam’s agent named Joel? That’s probably a reference, right?), then Balder shows up to recruit him. 

Cut back to the present, finally. Druid is handling the baby, while Balder tells Wonder Man to go stop their pursuer, but he refuses, because pacifist. Balder is confused because that all happened while he was dead. They cleverly work around Simon’s pacifism by having him destroy a bridge to stop their pursuer, causing thousands of dollars worth of property damage, which is probably worse than just punching whoever was following them, but who’s counting?

Then everybody gets out of the RV on the other side of the bridge to take a look at the guy following them- Ares, god of war! Who, coincidentally, is the father of Alexander, AKA Phobos, who was also a member of the Secret Warriors, the same team as Druid. I don’t think the comic mentions this once, but if it does, it’s not in this issue, which ends here. 

So, that’s the first issue of War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery, the first collective foray by the McElroys into writing actual comics, not “graphic novels,” a pathetic lesser art-form. (Watchmen was originally published in individual issue format, so don’t try to pull any gotchas on me there, nerds.) 

Honestly, not bad. The art is pretty shitty, and the jokes fall pretty flat for me, but then again my sense of humor is so warped at this point that I can only laugh at things like ‘Cumeatsoner Gordon,’ a version of Commissioner Gordon who eats cum. So, your mileage may vary as far as the humor goes. But the overall narrative is pretty solid, the characters are solidly written, and nothing happened to particularly annoy me. 

Since this was actually readable, I’m going to assume Clint did most of the work, which pretty much lines up with what they say in the video about the comic, albeit not in such explicit terms. I’m legitimately curious how they came up with this specific team, considering that Death Locket and Sebastian Druid are pretty obscure characters, but as far as I can tell (and I didn’t look very hard, so I could be wrong), that video was the only place where they actually discussed it, and even then, they barely said anything about the comic itself. 

Tune in... at some point in the future, maybe, for issue number two!

"Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot raises critical considerations – however in all probability not those you suppose&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56geq2kzgaq71.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b95604a0d4a9351d9a699ac14b5a768c7f4c7f5d

[Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) introduced a humanoid robotic designed to assist with these repetitive, boring duties folks hate doing. Musk recommended it may run to the grocery retailer for you, however presumably it might deal with any variety of duties involving guide labor.

[Predictably, social media](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) full of references to a string of dystopian sci-fi motion pictures about robots the place all the pieces goes horribly improper.

As troubling because the robotic futures in motion pictures like I, Robotic, [The Terminator ](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)and others are, it’s the underlying applied sciences of actual humanoid robots – and the intent behind them – that must be trigger for concern.

Musk’s robotic is being developed by Tesla. It’s a seeming departure from the corporate’s car-making enterprise, till you take into account that Tesla isn’t a typical automotive producer. The so-called “Tesla Bot” is an idea for a glossy, 125-pound humanlike robotic that may incorporate Tesla’s automotive synthetic intelligence and autopilot applied sciences to plan and observe routes, navigate visitors – on this case, pedestrians – and keep away from obstacles.

Dystopian sci-fi overtones apart, the plan is sensible, albeit inside [Musk’s enterprise technique](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/). The constructed setting is made by people, for people. And as [Musk argued](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) on the Tesla Bot’s announcement, profitable superior applied sciences are going to should be taught to navigate it in the identical methods folks do.

But Tesla’s vehicles and robots are merely the seen merchandise of a much wider plan aimed toward making a future the place superior applied sciences liberate people from our organic roots by mixing biology and know-how. As a researcher who research the moral and socially accountable improvement and use of rising applied sciences, I discover that this plan raises considerations that transcend speculative sci-fi fears of super-smart robots.

## [A person with large plans](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Self-driving vehicles, interplanetary rockets and brain-machine interfaces are steps towards the long run [Musk envisions](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) the place know-how is humanity’s savior. On this future, vitality might be low cost, ample and sustainable; folks will work in concord with clever machines and even merge with them; and people will grow to be an interplanetary species.

It’s a future that, judging by [Musk’s numerous endeavors](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), might be constructed on a set of underlying interconnected applied sciences that embrace sensors, actuators, vitality and knowledge infrastructures, techniques integration and substantial advances in pc energy. Collectively, these make a formidable toolbox for creating transformative applied sciences.

[Musk imagines](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) people finally transcending our evolutionary heritage by applied sciences which are beyond-human, or “tremendous” human. However earlier than know-how can grow to be superhuman, it first must be human – or no less than be designed to thrive in a human-designed world.

This make-tech-more-human strategy to innovation is what’s underpinning the applied sciences in Tesla’s vehicles, together with the intensive use of optical cameras. These, when linked to an AI “mind,” are meant to assist the autos autonomously navigate street techniques which are, in [Musk’s phrases](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), “designed for organic neural nets with optical imagers” – in different phrases, folks. In Musk’s telling, it’s a small step from human-inspired “robots on wheels” to humanlike robots on legs.

## [Simpler stated than accomplished](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Tesla’s “full self-driving” know-how, which incorporates the dubiously named Autopilot, is a place to begin for the builders of the Tesla Bot. Spectacular as this know-how is, it’s proving to be lower than absolutely dependable. Crashes and fatalities related to Tesla’s Autopilot mode – the most recent having to do with the algorithms struggling to acknowledge parked emergency autos — are calling into query the knowledge of releasing the tech into the wild so quickly.

A sequence of crashes involving Tesla’s autopilot know-how has prompted a federal investigation.  
[South Jordan Police Division through AP](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

This monitor document doesn’t bode properly for humanlike robots that depend on the identical know-how. But this isn’t only a case of getting the know-how proper. Tesla’s Autopilot glitches are exacerbated by human conduct. For instance, some Tesla drivers have handled their tech-enhanced vehicles as if they’re absolutely autonomous autos and didn’t pay ample consideration to driving. Might one thing comparable occur with the Tesla Bot?

## [Tesla Bot’s ‘orphan dangers](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)’

In my work on socially useful know-how innovation, I’m particularly serious about orphan dangers – dangers which are arduous to quantify and simple to miss and but inevitably find yourself tripping up innovators. My colleagues and I work with entrepreneurs and others on navigating a majority of these challenges by the Danger Innovation Nexus, an initiative of the [Arizona State College Orin Edson Entrepreneurship](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) \+ [Innovation Institute and International Futures Laboratory](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/).

The Tesla Bot comes with an entire portfolio of orphan dangers. These embrace doable threats to privateness and autonomy because the bot collects, shares and acts on doubtlessly delicate data; challenges related to how persons are possible to consider and reply to humanoid robots; potential misalignments between moral or ideological views – for instance, in crime management or policing civil protests; and extra. These are challenges which are hardly ever coated within the coaching that engineers obtain, and but overlooking them can spell catastrophe.

Whereas the Tesla Bot could seem benign – or perhaps a little bit of a joke – if it’s to be useful in addition to commercially profitable, its builders, buyers, future shoppers and others should be asking powerful questions on the way it would possibly threaten what’s vital to them and learn how to navigate these threats.

These threats could also be as particular as folks making unauthorized modifications that improve the robotic’s efficiency – making it transfer quicker than its designers meant, for instance – with out interested by the dangers, or as basic because the know-how being weaponized in novel methods. They’re additionally as delicate as how a humanoid robotic may threaten job safety, or how a robotic that features superior surveillance techniques may undermine privateness.

Then there are the challenges of technological bias which have been plaguing AI for a while, particularly the place it results in realized conduct that transform extremely discriminatory. For instance, AI algorithms have produced sexist and racist outcomes.

[MIT’s Pleasure Buolamwini](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) explains the specter of bias in AI.

## [Simply because we will, ought to we](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)?

The Tesla Bot might look like a small step towards [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient of superhuman applied sciences, and one which’s straightforward to write down off as little greater than hubristic showmanship. However the audacious plans underpinning it are critical — they usually elevate equally critical questions.

As an illustration, how accountable is [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient? Simply because he can work towards creating the way forward for his goals, who’s to say that he ought to? Is the long run that [Musk is striving](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) to result in the very best one for humankind, or perhaps a good one? And who will undergo the results if issues go improper?

These are the deeper considerations that the Tesla Bot raises for me as somebody who research and writes concerning the future and the way our actions affect it. This isn’t to say that Tesla Bot isn’t a good suggestion, or that [Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) shouldn’t be capable to flex his future-building muscle mass. Utilized in the fitting approach, these are transformative concepts and applied sciences that would open up a future filled with promise for billions of individuals.

\[Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletter to understand the world. [Sign up](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) today.\]

But when shoppers, buyers and others are bedazzled by the glitz of latest tech or dismissive of the hype and overlook the larger image, society dangers handing the long run to rich innovators whose imaginative and prescient exceeds their understanding. If their visions of the long run don’t align with what most individuals aspire to, or are catastrophically flawed, they’re at risk of standing in the best way of constructing a simply and equitable future.

Perhaps that is the abiding lesson from dystopian robot-future sci-fi motion pictures that individuals must be taking away because the Tesla Bot strikes from concept to actuality — not the extra apparent considerations of making humanoid robots that run amok, however the far bigger problem of deciding who will get to think about the long run and be part of constructing it.

"Sci-fi children’s book with AI and genetic modificationsThis is a children’s/middle grade book I read in the late 90’s/early 00’s. Can’t remember anything about the title or author! I read it in Swedish, but quite likely that it was a translation.

The part of the story I remember was about a girl growing up on a desert planet. She was the only person there. Her parents/the other colonists had died when she was a baby, and she was being raised by a humanlike robot that was like a parent to her. Finally, rescuers arrived. They were upset to discover that the AI had altered the girl genetically, in order to help her adapt and survive in the harsh environment. For example, she had double eyelids, like a lizard,  to shield her eyes from all the dust blowing about.  

Anyone recognise this at all?"
"Recap: ""War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery"" #1Background: In 2019, the McElroys wrote a tie-in comic for the completely forgettable Marvel Comics event 'War of the Realms,' which was written by terrible comics writer Jason Aaron, currently writing the worst run of Avengers in my lifetime (and I was technically alive for the Bendis years, even if I wasn't exactly reading comics at that age). They also recorded a seven-minute promo thing at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, which I had to watch to write this, subjecting myself to the McElroys' voices for the first time in years. You're welcome.

(Mini-recap of the video: I'm watching it right now, while I type this, and Travis just interrupted Justin talking about how good Clint is at writing comics, to say 'but he's totally unfunny, he has to ask us to help with that.' Really weird, just stops someone else in the middle of a sentence to shit on his dad, who clearly did 90% of the work on the actual comic. Anyway.)

The tie-in is five issues long, and it's the only part of the event I've actually read (except for the tie-in issues of the Superior Spider-Man run from the same year, which is surprisingly good, I recommend it). It's the McElroy's only foray into comics aside from the TAZ graphic novels (aside from Clint who wrote for them for years apparently, something I was only vaguely aware of before this, but explains why this thing is surprisingly good).

(Video mini-recap two: Justin just pulled the 'we have kids!' line! [frenzied audience screaming])

I'll get into the comic itself in a minute, but first...

About the Author: I got into the McElroys in... 2017, apparently? It feels like a fucking decade ago, but anyway. My first episode was Detective Jigsaw, My Very Best Friend, from MBMBAm. The titular bit nearly made me piss myself with laughter at the time. Following that, I got into the whole, uh, family of products. TaZ (Balance was finishing up right about then), the Polygon video stuff, their other podcasts (RIP to CoolGames Inc), you know the drill.

I kept listening for a while after that, but eventually, slowly lost interest. The last thing I can remember listening to was Amnesty, which I gave up on towards the end, when it turned into more bullshit end-of-the-world shit. Also Travis had really started to grate on me by that point. I kept watching new Monster Factory vids when they dropped, but eventually those stopped being funny too, so I dropped that as well.

(If you're combing through my reddit history to find something to dunk on me with, fuck you. I was a teenager, and you're a loser for trying to own me by pointing out that I used to listen to a cringe soy podcast, or whatever.)

These days, I listen to two podcasts: Chapo, and The Adam Friedland Show. I lurk on this subreddit mostly out of schadenfreude. Also I've written [two](https://hawkshawinheritance.wordpress.com/)^1 [books](https://thewinterswill.wordpress.com/)^2, and I'm working on [my third](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56861/ambitions-arrow/).^3

Now we're at the part where I talk about the actual comic itself. About fucking time, I know. The video I watched didn't *really* specify who wrote most of it, but since it's readable, I'm going to assume Clint, with maybe a smattering of Griffin.

Before I start breaking the comic down, I wanna give a quick introduction to the cast, partly because the comic kinda doesn't bother.

* Spider-Man (Miles Morales): It's Spider-Man! No, the other one. I can't say I'm particularly fond of Miles. He's got no real personality to speak of, and the giant marketing push for him makes me want to like him even less, because I've got a bit of a contrarian impulse. Plus, Marvel editors were pretty explicit that they turned a character I *do* like, Ben Reilly, into a villain, *specifically* because having him be a good guy was 'redundant' with Miles running around.
* Hawkeye (Kate Bishop): It's Hawkeye! No, the other one. I do kinda like her, because the 2012 Hawkeye run did a good job of making her likable and giving her a personality. You've probably got some passing familiarity with her, but if not... it's Hawkeye but a twentysomething woman. She's got a bow and some arrows.
* Wonder Man: I like this guy. So does Travis, unfortunately. Apparently he's Vart's favorite character, presumably because he used to be a raging narcissist? He was a classic-era Avenger, his powers involve 'ionic energy,' which is just purple lasers with some Kirby Krackle. Used to be a big-time Hollywood actor as well as a superhero, these days he's a pacifist, because he thinks superheroes do more harm than good.
* Sebastian Druid: Now we're getting into the obscure types. Sebastian Druid was a character introduced in 'Secret Warriors,' a 2008 series written by Jonathan Hickman, one of the only good writers left in the comics industries, and Brian Bendis, one of the worst. He uses magic. That's pretty much all you need to know about him. Secret Warriors is good, mainly because Bendis leaves pretty early on. Also, Sebastian died in the pages of Avengers World, but came back immediately (as in, the same issue) as a ghost. No mention of this is made in the comic as far as I can tell, and he's pretty clearly not a ghost. This continuity error will probably never be addressed, unless Al Ewing develops a sudden interest in the character or something.
* Death Locket (Rebeca Ryder): A bit of a pet character for me, honestly. She's a teenage girl whose father turned her into a killer cyborg called a Deathlok. She first showed up in the not-very-good Avengers Arena, where a supervillain called Arcade kidnapped her and a bunch of other teenage heroes, and made them do Hunger Games stuff. Then she moved to Avengers Undercover, where her and a bunch of the survivors went after Arcade and ended up lowkey becoming villains for a bit. She's the only one who *actually* became a villain, joining the Young Masters of Evil, which is where that series left her. She's not with them in this, though- also entirely unaddressed.
* Balder the Brave: Thor's brother! No, the other one. He's a tertiary Asgard character, who had recently been resurrected at the time of this being written, so half the jokes are about how he doesn't recognize any of these other guys. No real opinions on him, honestly.

(Also there's a talking dog named Thori, I guess? Who gives a shit.)

So, the actual comic:

We start with a recap page that gives the rundown of the War of the Realms event so far. It's honestly not that relevant to the actual story, and also written in that awful unreadable """"""Norse"""""" font that Marvel likes to use, so I'm skipping it.

First actual page: An RV (no idea what that actually stands for, but a mobile home) is driving away from somebody shooting fireballs at it. Spider-Man is sitting in the back and makes note of this.

Hawkeye is driving the RV, and Wonder Man is watching a video on his phone about how to... secure a baby carrier-thing to a car seat, I think? The baby is Thor's little sister, who the as-yet unnamed bad guys chasing the heroes are after.

Death Locket shows up to help Wonder Man with the baby-carrier thing. I can't remember what they're supposed to be called, and it's annoying me. Then we get a look at who's chasing them- a frankly sick-looking sixteen-wheeler (only ten wheels that I count, actually, but I don't think that's a thing. who knows) that's spurting flame from every available truck-orifice it has. Balder shows up for two panels to mention he used to be dead, then we go into a flashback.

Flashback: Thor and Freya (Thor's mom) explain to Balder that Thor (and by extension Balder) now has a baby sister, named Laussa. There's a joke about Freya and Odin having sex. Balder pledges to protect his new baby sister.

The rest of the issue is basically an extended flashback getting us closer to where the comic opens, in the form of a getting-the-band-together montage. So next we go to the BBEG of this event, 'Sindr' (seriously, Aaron? Sindr? fuck off), doing a villain monologue about wanting to Kill That Baby. Freya tells Balder to go save the baby, and sends the talking dog with him.

Balder runs into Miles Morales in Times Square, saving people cosplaying as superheroes from demons who think they’re actual superheroes. Kind of funny, I guess? There’s also a bit here where a character basically turns to camera and says ‘I’m gay, by the way.’ Not literally, but close enough. Obviously I have zero issue with gay representation in media, but this is pretty much the cheapest possible way to do it, by inserting it into the story with zero grace or subtlety, and by making the ‘rep’ a pair of background characters who appear on a single page. The ‘Trans Rights written on a piece of printer paper hanging on the wall behind you as you livestream’ of representation in media. 

Miles gets grabbed by a demon, but Balder saves him, comically mistakes him for the real Spider-Man, and asks for his help. We flash forward a bit, and Miles is explaining that there are roughly ten million Spider-Men running around right now. Which is true, and sucks.

With the help of some rando NPC from the Jason Aaron run on Thor, they drive to a giant Asgardian fortress in Oklahoma, where a guy called Skuld, one of the Norns, delivers a prophecy about how to protect Thor’s little sister, who gets handed off to Balder. There’s a whole page basically dedicated to the ‘Balder mistakes legacy character for their original counterpart’ joke, which is still only kind of funny. The prophecy mentions an archer, a magic user, a cyborg, and Wonder Man, all of whom except the cyborg, Balder recognizes (but mistakes for a different, more popular character). 

Why these specific character are required is never explained, but as far as blatant plot devices to assemble a specific team go, it’s, uh... pretty bad, actually. Whatever.

Cut to Texas, where Kate Bishop is fighting some Z-List villain called Slaughter-Man, a play on ‘manslaughter.’ Maybe he’s an established Marvel character, maybe the McElroys made him up, I dunno, and I’m not gonna check.

Okay, I checked. Apparently he’s an OC! The McElroys have made an actual contribution to Marvel canon, with a wiki page and everything! It’s a shitty pun character, so I’m gonna assume Travis came up with him. 

Turns out Kate isn’t fighting him because he’s a villain, she’s serving him divorce papers, because she’s a P.I., which is pretty funny. Also she shoots an arrow on either side of his balls and threatens to ‘split the difference,’ which is... actually pretty in-character, I guess. Balder and Miles show up in the last panel to recruit her. 

Cut to New Mexico, where Death Locket is at a graduation party... or so it seems. She’s talking with her dad and SHIELD agent Dum-Dum Dugan, original member of Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos, bearer of a killer mustache. 

(Also, sidebar, the art on this comic is... passable at best. Just saying. The McElroys had nothing to do with that bit, so I’m not gonna harp on it, but yeesh.)

Oh, and hey, Black Widow and Iron Man are there! That seems weird, shouldn’t they be trying to save the world right now or something? There’s a generic Marvel summer event going on outside! 

Turns out everyone at the party except Becca are LMDs, or Life-Model Decoys, humanlike robots that she’s programmed to pretend to be her friends, as she lives on a downed SHIELD Helicarrier full of the things, and has no actual friends. Which is weird, because last she showed up in a comic, she had a bunch of villain-friends, including a boyfriend whose powers included hitting people with a shovel. I guess she ditched them at some point? Who knows. 

The weird thing is, you really wouldn’t expect the McElroys to have any idea who fucking Death Locket is at all. She’s pretty goddamn obscure, so presumably one of them read Avengers Arena and liked her, and decided to dredge her up for this, years after her last appearance. That, or Marvel editorial (such as it exists these days) suggested her. But either way, why didn’t they bother to do a cursory check on what her current status quo was- namely running with the Young Masters -before using her in this? Same goes for Druid. 

Most likely answer- the two laziest groups of people in the world are Marvel editors and the McElroys. They have kids, dammit! No time to be checking for basic continuity errors like ‘is this character currently alive or not.’

The whole LMD thing gets revealed when Balder, Miles, and Kate barge into the party to recruit Rebecca, thinking she’s the cyborg the prophecy mentioned, but expecting Deathlok Classic, who looks significantly less cute than Becca. Also it’s not explained in the slightest how they found her, but I guess the Norn probably told them, come to think of it. Becca agrees to help them, because Balder is doing this to protect his family, and she likes to pretend the LMDs are her family, which I guess sort of makes sense? 

Next we cut to Arizona, where Sebastian Druid, inexplicably not a ghost, is babysitting some snot-nosed kid. He accidentally pulls a magic wand out of his knockoff John Constantine trenchcoat and freaks out a cashier and the kid, which gets him tossed in jail. Apparently he can’t magic himself out, or doesn’t get the chance at least, because Balder shows up almost immediately to bust him out, and recruit him for the baby-saving mission. Druid is immediately on-board, because he’s clearly pretty down on his luck. 

(You’d think a SHIELD-trained magic user would be able to get a better job than Literal Babysitter, but whatever, he’s also supposed to be a fucking ghost.)

Cut to LA, where-- actually, hold on. 

These guys are recruiting people from all over the country, but it’s not really clear how they’re getting to and from these locations so fast, particularly with the forces of ‘Sindr’ presumably chasing them and the baby the whole way. And if they have some means of rapid transit, why do they need to take the baby to wherever they’re going in a fucking RV? If they don’t have rapid transit, they’re just... driving back and forth across the country, from NY to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to LA, while being pursued by the as-yet unnamed antagonist, *just* to recruit people? A trip that would take days? When they could just head straight to their ultimate destination? 

Whatever. 

Cut to LA, where Simon Williams, AKA Wonder Man, washed-up actor and ex-superhero, is getting pitched on a TV show about himself by some Hollywood Guy. They want him to fight a knockoff version of the Vision, his sorta-brother, in the show. Also they want him playing himself, I guess- but he refuses, because he’s a pacifist. Which apparently extends to pretend-fighting in movies and on TV? I dunno. 

So he heads back to his RV (is he living in an RV? He was an actor and an Avenger, he should be living in a penthouse even if he has no current income stream, that shit pays. Whatever.) and bitches about it to his agent Joel (is the McElroy fam’s agent named Joel? That’s probably a reference, right?), then Balder shows up to recruit him. 

Cut back to the present, finally. Druid is handling the baby, while Balder tells Wonder Man to go stop their pursuer, but he refuses, because pacifist. Balder is confused because that all happened while he was dead. They cleverly work around Simon’s pacifism by having him destroy a bridge to stop their pursuer, causing thousands of dollars worth of property damage, which is probably worse than just punching whoever was following them, but who’s counting?

Then everybody gets out of the RV on the other side of the bridge to take a look at the guy following them- Ares, god of war! Who, coincidentally, is the father of Alexander, AKA Phobos, who was also a member of the Secret Warriors, the same team as Druid. I don’t think the comic mentions this once, but if it does, it’s not in this issue, which ends here. 

So, that’s the first issue of War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery, the first collective foray by the McElroys into writing actual comics, not “graphic novels,” a pathetic lesser art-form. (Watchmen was originally published in individual issue format, so don’t try to pull any gotchas on me there, nerds.) 

Honestly, not bad. The art is pretty shitty, and the jokes fall pretty flat for me, but then again my sense of humor is so warped at this point that I can only laugh at things like ‘Cumeatsoner Gordon,’ a version of Commissioner Gordon who eats cum. So, your mileage may vary as far as the humor goes. But the overall narrative is pretty solid, the characters are solidly written, and nothing happened to particularly annoy me. 

Since this was actually readable, I’m going to assume Clint did most of the work, which pretty much lines up with what they say in the video about the comic, albeit not in such explicit terms. I’m legitimately curious how they came up with this specific team, considering that Death Locket and Sebastian Druid are pretty obscure characters, but as far as I can tell (and I didn’t look very hard, so I could be wrong), that video was the only place where they actually discussed it, and even then, they barely said anything about the comic itself. 

Tune in... at some point in the future, maybe, for issue number two!

"Ask me some questions to help me develope my new Sci-fi world!I should describe it first so you have an idea of what to ask.

In the ~~grim dark of the far future~~ near future, malevolent medical AI engineered an unstoppable plague called the macrophage(the AI were *supposed* to be making phages to save lives) which wiped out 80% of the world's population, with the remaining people simply hiding in massive vaults until a cure was found. Once the macrophage was cured, humanity remmerged from the bunkers to find that there were not enough humans to rebuild society as it once was. To fix this, they focused their efforts on creating very humanlike robots. These robots were better then unmodified humans, and outnumbered them more then 2:1.

When humanity realized that perhaps having synths that were objectively better then them may be a bad plan, they began heavily investing in cybernetics, but it was too late. When about 75% of the synths on Earth rebelled, they wiped out all but 5 million humans, with 1/5th escaping to Humanities flourishing colonies, and the rest returning to the plague vaults, awaiting rescue, where they remain today, 30 years later.

And lastly, on those flourishing colonies I spoke of. The only self sufficient colony pre plague was the American colony dug into the side of Olympus Mons. The other, non self sufficient colonies turned to Olympus Mons for salvation. As a result, Olympus Mons held great influence. Once the plague had ended, Olympus Mons organized the new arrivals into new colonial charters and pressured the other, smaller colonies into joining its federation, called the Protectorate of Humanity. When the synth rebellion happened, Mars was unaffected. This was because Martians were almost invaryably cyborgs(this was to help deal with the health effects of low gravity), so they had just slaved their synths directly too their minds. Unlike Earth, synths weren't needed to rebuild the population, and instead performed menial jobs that martians didn't want to do.

Earth may be stronger now, but the Protecterate owns space, so it is seemingly only a matter of time before Humanity returns to cure this new plague.

Ask away, this will teach me just as much about my world as it will teach you!"
"Binary Domain (2012) | Do Japanese devs dream of Gears of War?Binary Domain is a 2012 third-person shooter developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and was released in the so-called ""dark age of the Japanese game industry"" when the Japanese studios were attempting to appeal to the western markets by copying and pasting Gears and Call of Duty. This resulted in some of the weirdest mixes of the western game design and the eastern game design. Some were successful, like Vanquish and... I think that was the only good one. The others like Resident Evil 6, Quantum Theory, Operation Troy, Bionic Commando, Front Mission Evolved, Operation Raccoon City, Mindjack didn't fair well at all.

Binary Domain is a curious case. It was once considered the latter category of 'failure', but it has later gained a cult following. It is [retrospectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6dUv5kEac) [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OBho8Dtj0) [a ""hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jYsWKwkurE) [gem""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66cTc95XK8), some going far as to claim it is a cursed masterpiece. The reception has changed 180 degrees. I have rarely seen such a shift in public consensus before. After playing it myself,  I think the initial reception rated it just right. People seem to overly gush about it too much just because it was made by the Yakuza creators. Had this game been made by the western studio, I don't believe the same retrospective reappreciation would have happened.

With this said, once the abysmal first two-hour introduction--which was so bad that I almost turned the game off--is over, the game is not bad. It does fair better than a lot of Japanese attempts at Gears of War. It is competent and unique in many areas. This is a generic shooter at the first glance, it has this weird blend of western and Japanese video game quirks and camp. Imagine the Gears of War macho-military team dropped in the background of Metal Gear Rising. So the game is not quite as campy as some of the PlatinumGames' works, but there are some moments that get close to them. It is confusing whether or not some moments are meant to be serious or funny.

For example, [there is a dumb cutscene in which the President holds the meeting to talk about robotics, and in the middle of the conversation, one of them mentions how robots don't know they are robots. Then as if signaled, the guards pull out their weapons on one of the generals. The general panics and the guards begin riddling the general with bullets, who turns out to be a robot.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=412) There are so many absurdities in this single scene that I was laughing out loud, and again, I'm not sure if this scene is dramatic and failing, or meant to be hilarious. They talk about how these super high-tech human-like robots are something they have never heard before. Then why would you destroy it right away when you have the perfect chance to capture it? You would want to examine it, not waste it. Also, if they had already known about the general being the robot, why would you invite him to the meeting and shoot it in front of the POTUS? It is incredibly dangerous. What if the robot took the gun away and shot the POTUS? Why would you not apprehend it in some other safer places?

[Another notable dumb moment in which Rachel plants an explosive on the door and sets it to 10 seconds, warns people ""Fire in the hole!"" and the other two soldiers literally stand around the door as if they have never seen an explosive before.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=2450) Why are they standing there? When the bomb blows up, one of the guys comments, ""I hate when she does that."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? Again, is it supposed to be a moment to make Rachel look badass? Or is it supposed to be a comedic moment? I don't know.

There are so many dumb moments like this. There is a scene where the team gets captured, and they are thrown into the garbage dump to be killed by abandoned robots, yet for some reason, they still have guns with them. Like... the enemies forgot to take away their weapons. Or the police show up or disappear whenever the plot demands to. There is an (optional) underdeveloped, insane romance subplot that cringed me so much.

I actually hoped the game was even more ridiculous. It almost borders on being insane, but not quite there. It honestly feels like written by the anime fan who has watched too much of I, Robot and Blade Runner, and they just borrowed a bunch of concepts from those films without thinking about how the world would function. One of the core conflicts in this story is that the ""Hollow Children"", robots with human-like skins, have infiltrated western societies for decades. It is apparently so hard to differentiate the two, but... is it, though? Again, these beings have been living in the societies for *decades* and they are programmed to not know they are robots. In Blade Runner, it makes sense that it is hard to differentiate because Replicants are biologically no different from humans. In this game, these Hollow Children are all comprised of machine parts. One of the iconic shots from this game is literally a humanlike robot with its face blown up, and its inside is distinctively robotic. Literally a CT or X-ray scanner would be sufficient. Yet this game says these beings have gone unnoticed for decades. Are you telling me not a single one thought to have a CT or an X-ray? None of them went to airports in which the place is full of metal detectors?

Still, there are some strong merits to the narrative. There are story elements that shockingly resemble Blade Runner 2049 that I left wondering if the filmmakers played this game. It has a fascinating world that centers around global warming and robotics. The cutscene direction is great. The dialogue comes across the Japanese people attempting to out-do Gears of War, but I do enjoy the characters, especially the French military robot Cain. The villain twist is a refreshing jab at the jingoistic, chauvinistic military shooter narratives.

However, the real meat of the story is the interactive narrative design that changes depending on the friendship system. It not only changes the endings, it changes how the characters treat the player and who lives or who dies in the plot. The player can select certain teammates to bring into the mission, and it is incredible how much the game considered so many different interactions. Whenever you select, the cutscenes come across as natural. It is cool to watch how the cutscenes change depending on who you bring with you. Although I got the 'good ending', some of my characters ended up dying, I have an urge to replay the game just to get all my characters alive.

There are some discrepancies that are caused by this branching path narrative design though. There is a scene where I meet a Resistance leader, who reveals he fights the government because of their hatred of ""scrap-heads"". ...But Cain, a literal scrap-head, is in my crew, and this scrap-head hating Resistance doesn't respond to him at all. In fact, no one in the Resistance is bothered at all. I think at the very least one of them would question this fact, but no.

You can increase or decrease the relationship bar through the combat, which works great because it uses the core gameplay loop to tell and shape the story. However, I have no idea what's this dialogue system doing here. It is not even the dialogue system. It is just a comm system but with short responses to whatever the teammate is saying. The dialogues are boring and the only choices you have in this dialogue system are ""be good"" and ""be mean."" There is no incentive to ""be mean"". Telling a ""good response"" is so easy to choose that there is no dilemma. It is like that inFamous game in which the choices are insanely binary that it only exposes how shallow the narrative is. Some choices are downright confusing. What does ""Damn"" response mean? Does this mean ""Was that damn awesome"" or ""Damn you""?

What is worse is how the dialogue system continually interrupts the gameplay. Remember how annoying the random radio communication scripted scenes in the Gears games where the player is suddenly slowed down to walking speed even though they should have no reason to move slowly? Binary Domain doubles those moments and it is infuriating. I think the pacing would have been so much better without these sections. It is also weird that my character is a super talkative guy, but in the actual gameplay, he's completely mute for the sake of the dialogue system.

Speaking of the squad interactions, the squad AI is abysmal. Half of the time, my commands are useless. There is one section where the player has to push a fuel tank, and it takes like two minutes to do it. If the fuel tank blows up by the enemy fire, the player has to do it all over again. And my squad wouldn't cover me. I literally ordered them to cover me, and they respond they can't. If they said yes, they didn't do jack shit. So I had to try again and again until I just left my teammate to push the fuel tank. There are frequent moments in which the enemies were shooting, yet my squad would stand there and get shot. I was ducking and shooting the enemies, then my squad just comes over to my position and push me out of cover for no apparent reason. For some moments, I was the only one who was engaging the enemy and the other guys were just ordering me around. The worst of all, my squad for no reason ran over to my firing line and got hit, got pissed off at me, and cut the relationship bar. It couldn't believe how bad this got.

A lot of these flaws could have been remedied had the command system been actually deeper. The tactical depth is a puddle. There are not many interactions the player can do. For example, you can't assign a team to a certain location or flank. These are basic features. I didn't expect Ghost Recon but compare Binary Domain to Army of Two, which has an almost identical Gears combat design and the squad-central gameplay. Army of Two has the cover system as a core part of the gameplay loop, constantly moving around and managing Aggro, pinning down enemies. The cover isn't just used for reloading. The cover is required to strategically fight the enemy, using diverse abilities in a variety of ways, sending your teammates to flank enemies or draw fire, etc. And Army of Two was released 5 years before this game.

The levels are far too constrained to have any strategic depth. Gears of War: Judgment and Uncharted 2 and 3 had vertical, arena-like levels where each encounter was designed with the mind that they are combat sandboxes. In those games, I found myself dodging and rolling rather than constantly hiding behind a cover. In Binary Domain, most levels are just corridors. There is a single memorable sequence in the objective design in which the team has to hold off the enemies until one of your teammates takes a shit in the toilet, and this is a funny escort mission I have not seen before. Other than that, they are all bland.

As a linear corridor shooter, it isn't all that effective and some obstacles are confusing. There is one moment that I got stuck where I have to go to the water pump control room to rescue my team within the time limit. However, the road is blocked with the barrels, and I was trying to shoot the barrels and they won't budge. I had no idea what I was supposed to do until I watched the playthrough and realized what I had to do was use the special attack of my rifle to destroy the barrels. The special attack was mentioned once in the tutorials ages ago. There was no other moment in which I had to use my special attack of the gun to go through a path. The game fails to communicate and telegraph the information that the special attack can clear the way.

The game also injects a bunch of weird minigames and they all control rather clunky. There are a jetski, a waterslide, a SOTC-style climbing a boss sequence, and the last one is especially terrible. 

Regarding the shooting, this is where the game shines. Shooting a robot feels amazing. Most shooters revolve around shooting at organic bodies with blood splashing all around, but tearing parts of a mechanical body is just as satisfying. There are so many different types of enemies. The boss fights are awe-inspiring, although they can drag out too long and overstay their welcome. 

It still has a lot of problems though. If you use the controller because the mouse and keyboard set-up has an atrocious mouse acceleration that never got fixed. Whenever the player rolls and takes cover during the reload, the reload reverts, so you have to reload all over again. You cannot change your weapon during the reloading. These three issues are so 6th-gen that I am shocked an AAA shooter in 2012 has them. The player movement is lackluster and there are so many moments in which I couldn't snap into the cover for some reason.

Another issue is the tearing off body part feature is while satisfying, it barely serves as a feature that deepens the gameplay. In the latter half of the game, I pretty much did nothing but mindlessly blast through every on-screen enemy with the weapons because there is no moment where I was forced to think about proper weapon choice or resource management like any actually well-designed shooter. The upgrade system fuels this problem. Rather than the upgrade being customizing different parts of a gun so a gun can be specialized in your taste (like the recent Doom games), you just increase the stats of the gun. Once you upgrade two weapons, the default SOWSAR and the sniper rifle, there is no reason to upgrade any other weapon. They are so powerful that other guns become irrelevant. Hell, there are even three assault rifles that essentially serve the same function. In shooters, every gun should have a unique function, role, purpose. There shouldn't just be three clones of other guns that just shoot different colored, weaker projectiles. Every weapon should ideally require and reward skill, half the sandbox shouldn't be useless just because they would be overpowered if they are not due to how easy they are to use (hence why automatics are terrible in most games). 

Compare this game to Doom Eternal, which has the player break the armors of the enemies to reveal weak points that require different tactics and approaches, like Binary Domain. However, in Doom Eternal, there are often multiple approaches to dealing with the same enemy, such as Shotgun grenades, scoped Heavy Cannon, and Ballista all being effective at breaking weak points, or Plasmagun lightning and Minigun both being good at locking down rushing Hell Knights, or limited rockets allowing you to pick your battles and skip the dance of combat against a few enemies entirely. In Binary Domain, all you need are two weapons that are good at all things once upgraded and completely remove the actual point of having different guns.

Reading all this, I might sound too negative about Binary Domain. Again, the game isn't bad. It is decent at best. But it just floors me how many people make it out as a hidden masterpiece that I can't help but pull the game down a bit. It has a serviceable foundation for a better sequel or a spiritual successor. Seriously, I imagine a great Clone Wars game in which you play as an ARC trooper fighting against the droid army using this template. It is shame the potential hasn't been fulfilled here."

"[FNAF: Security Breach / Detroit: Become Human] The Glitchtrap virus caused the Glamrock animatronics to become deviants.The terminology ""deviant"" is taken from the game *Detroit: Become Human*, which features androids, or humanlike robots or animatronics:

>Becoming **deviant** or **deviancy** is a phenomenon where [androids](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Android) deviate from their programmed behavior. \[...\]  In a [profile filmed](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife_Tour) by [KNC](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/KNC), [CyberLife](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/CyberLife) founder and android developer [Elijah Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) denied the possibility of androids ever going against, or developing past, their programming.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy was commonly seen as a machine malfunction, caused by processing error or virus, and judged either negligible or a threat to human safety.** Others, however, saw it as a sign of emerging consciousness in androids, which some saw as a threat to be extinguished while others were empathetic and tried to help androids.  
>  
>[Kamski](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Kamski) claims **deviance is like some sort of errors in programs, the exchange of identification programs between androids would cause the error to spread like an epidemic**. The virus would stay dormant until an android suffers an emotional shock. He suspects the error may start from one model, or as a spontaneous mutation. Kamski suggests a copy error might be the cause of deviancy.  
>  
>\[...\] **Deviancy expresses itself in the development of thoughts and behavior not included in or even against an** **android**\*\*'s programming. The androids develop feelings and independent opinions and wishes, leading up to recognizing themselves as a being with consciousness and personhood.\*\*  
>  
>**At some point in this process, the android fully breaks away from its human-imposed programming and becomes autonomous, at that point having unencumbered free will.** The break itself (as well as previous deviant acts) is often triggered by extreme situations and experiences.  
>  
>\[...\] **Following the break, the android often acts out in a severe and noticeable fashion, such as running away, or enacting violence towards humans, precipitated by the distressing circumstances surrounding the break.** (This should however not be mistaken as a symptom of deviancy itself, but simply that of a sentient being now capable of reacting and self-defense.)  
>  
>Due to its overt nature, this is commonly the point at which an android is recognized as, and termed a 'deviant', but the term has also been applied to **androids showing deviant behaviors without having fully broken free of their programming**.  
>  
>At least [one android](https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Kara) is known to have deviated immediately upon first assembly, **referred to as experiencing 'technical difficulty' at the time**. This illustrates the varying range of time taken to deviate, which may happen quickly or after years.  
>  
>Deviants are able to intentionally 'pass on' deviancy by physically interfacing with another android, 'waking' them to consciousness and autonomy directly, skipping the usual process.

Evidence from ""Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach"" of the androids showing deviancy symptoms:

1. The situation and circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Glamrock Bonnie prior to the events of the game, including Bonnie acting seemingly of his own accord, wandering into Monty Golf, and being found in such a state that Monty had to replace him as the bass player.
2. All of the main animatronics - Glamrock Freddy, Glamrock Chica, Roxanne Wolf, Monty Gator, and the Daycare Attendant (Sun/Moon) - all seem to show signs of deviancy, including appearing distinctly more ""humanlike"" than their predecessor animatronics; having autonomy, or even unencumbered free will, in Freddy's case; acting out in ""a severe and noticeable fashion"", including aggression and enacting violence towards objects, other animatronics, or even human children (i.e. Gregory); and, in Freddy's case, the development of thoughts and behavior not included in, or even against, the animatronic's programming.
3. The Glitchtrap virus causing errors and other problems in the animatronics' programming to allow Vanny and Glitchtrap - i.e. Wiliam Afton / Springtrap / Burntrap - to ""hijack"" the animatronics to do their bidding; and, to some extent, Freddy and the Daycare Attendant (Sun) being self-aware and conscious enough to recognize the ""errors in their software"". Freddy and Sun even express fear and uncertainty - human emotions - in regards to realizing that something is wrong with them, but they don't know why, and/or how to fully ""fix"" or combat it.
4. The deviancy in the animatronics is routinely treated as ""some sort of errors in the program(s), or a machine malfunction"", as expressed with multiple notes or messages picked up by the player (Gregory) within the game. Despite their best efforts to reset or ""fix"" the animatronics of their deviancy, Freddy Fazbear Entertainment technicians and engineers have been unable to fully rectify the problem, much to their confusion and frustration. This also explains why Freddy is put on low power by technicians after he collapses during the show in the game's intro. According to collected notes, they are still deciding on whether or not Bonnie can be salvaged and re-used (if he has not already been re-used already, i.e. the ""Bonnie is Monty"" theory).
5. The ""good"" endings where Gregory escapes with Freddy (and Vanessa, if you complete all ""Princess Quest"" games in order) shows Freddy not like his animatronic counterparts, but clearly having autonomy, free will, and living an idyllic life where he takes care of Gregory. In a way, this mirrors android Kara's path to deviancy in *Detroit: Become Human*, where she breaks away from her programming in order to protect, and care for, a little girl named Alice from threats.

YouTuber SuperHorrorBro also covers what likely happened to Bonnie more in-depth in his video [""Bonnie's Secret Story in FNAF: Security Breach""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoyuePz1V8), in which he explains how Vanny likely infected Bonnie with the Glitchtrap virus. However, because the virus is a corrupted version of the deviant virus, very different from the kind we see in *Detroit: Become Human*, we also see the animatronics slowly become corrupted by it, as seen with the slowly degenerating appearance of them throughout the game.

However, depending on which ending is ""canon"" - and whether nor not the ending where Gregory defeats William Afton / Burntrap is the ""true"" ending - the animatronics may or may not be freed of Glitchtrap's influence. However, because they were still infected with the deviancy virus, even if they are ""cured"" of Glitchtrap's corruption, the virus will likely still cause them to gain more autonomy and free will in the future. We may see the animatronics become even more ""humanlike"" in the future.

*But hey, that's just a theory...a FNAF theory!*"
"A Dozen Socialist Science Fiction Novels - Enjoy![""The Dispossessed"" by Ursula Le Guin](https://libcom.org/library/dispossessed-ursula-le-guin)  

&nbsp;

> A 1974 Science Fiction novel by Ursula K. Le Guin. Subtitled An Ambiguous Utopia, it tells the story of Shevek, a brilliant physicist from the planet Anarres, traveling to the world of Urras to complete his work on the theory of time, which would make instantaneous interstellar communication possible. The planet Anarres, arid and barely habitable, was colonized by refugees from Urras who established an anarcho-syndicalist society there. Urras, by contrast, is a lush, rich world but the two superpowers on the planet, A-Io (capitalist) and Thu (state-socialist), are in a state of cold war. The even-numbered chapters describe Shevek and his family's life on Anarres while the odd-numbered chapters tell the story of his adventures on Urras.

> As nuclear war looms, a probe has discovered an Earthlike planet waiting with open biosphere; and the Americans launch a crash project to colonize Chiron. Science can't yet transport living humans between stars, but it can send DNA codes to become children who will be raised by humanlike robots. Amazingly, it works. The colonists are everything their home-planet could hope for - except that they really mean it about all that liberty stuff. But now the Earthmen have had their war, survived, rebuilt--and sent ships to Chiron. They're the government. They've come to help. But the colonials have such an attitude.

[""News From Nowhere"" by William Morris](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/News_from_Nowhere)  

&nbsp;


> News from Nowhere (1890) is a classic work combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer William Morris. In the book, the narrator falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. The remainder of the book explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolishment of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work.

I know these sound like big words for a little kid like me lol, but my mind is set on pursuing this path. 

From statistics and applied maths/comp sci for building AI programs, engineering/physics for manufacturing advanced hardware and possibly nanotech, cognitive science for the probable advent of conscious and humanlike robots/computer interfaces/neural nets, and whatever it takes for a transhumanism breakthrough, I've considered some possibilities of where I'd like to dabble in.

Appearance: A mermaid in a chicken-walker type thingy. Red hair, too, to signify she's (somehow) part of the Junkers. Which would explain the chicken walker.

I just have one question about lots of humans living (permanently?) on the planet Mars.

What will a human conceived, gestated and delivered on Mars be like?

I see rapid anatomical/physiological planetary adaptation and potentially straight up speciation, if, and that is a big if, a human can survive birth (or to birth) on Mars and not be physically messed up six ways to Sunday. Humans are exquisitely adapted to our ""gravity well"" on Earth and our bodies don't take kindly to big gravity changes. Not to mention light, radiation and artificial atmosphere--by that I mean life support systems. You don't wear a jacket to go outside on Mars. You may be tempted because Martian equatorial temperatures can reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (during the day)--but don't.

For these reasons I argue that we must develop our technology to allow us to discard biology so that we can become a true space-faring sentience. I actually think we are moving in that direction already. Whether we are conscious of it or not.

I also actually believe we are going to more effectively explore inner space** rather than outer.

This is a bit of a rabbit hole...

If a stem cell therapy is associated with chiropractic in any way, shape or form, critical thinking should keep you from accessing it.

(Chiropractic is snake oil.

The only reason a physician knowingly lets you go to a chiropractor is because it probably won't make things worse and could be a useful adjunct treatment to the mental and emotional state of the patient. Until the year 2016 a USA physician was prohibited from making chiropractic referrals. 

If you need chiropractic style manipulation, visit a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) a form of physician who is familiar with and can perform the ""manipulations"" that a chiropractor administors. The DO however has vastly more accurate knowledge.)

TL;DR It's coming faster than we thought. It's going to be disruptive. We hope that retraining will help, but we don't have the time luxury of generational adaptation. The report dismisses UBI and a ""post-scarcity"" society as options.

One of the things that humans understandably fail to realize is the godlike power of properly developed narrow AI. In a few years narrow AI enhanced by quantum computing. The ""foundation"" already easily exists. There will come a point in probably less than 20 years when millions of level 5 autonomy human carrying drones are in the air at once. I don't know what kind of wireless broadband technology will follow 5G, but whatever it is, it will supersede 5G in less than ten years I'm quite confident. The combination of materials science, human aspiration, narrow AI, and computing power and capacity will make a world in 20 years like nothing we can imagine today. And that is just the world of flying cars.

That last bit was meant to be funny. You were 'sposed to laugh. xD (I'm also starting to suspect yer a girl! lol!)

In the meantime I have been a working stiff for the last 36 years and in 9 years hopefully I will get to retire. (Unless we get like god forbid, aging reversal technology or something and I have to work until im like 80 or something. That would figure. I hope the AI takes over before I'm 65 and I can just lay around on the couch and play World of Warcraft in VR and all my food and stuff is free. I'm a guy.)

What I hope happens though is some kind of employment income plus partial UBI or perhaps a sort of negative income tax based on how much you make, so I do get like food or electricity for free in effect.

But the development of AI, robotics and automation is moving with frightening speed and my fears I stated earlier are genuine. I'm not so much worried about global warming as simply not getting snuffed out within the next 10-15 years.

Exactly. I have often stated that the only way for UBI to truly work is if I am the only one receiving it. The tax burden on everyone else would be so tiny they would not even notice--but don't tell on me, because they might get mad.

The problem is if you start giving UBI to just everybody, that it gets so watered down that it is no longer effective. (For me I mean.)

Science fiction does neither help nor convince anybody to act today.
 
That's the problem in a nutshell. Most of humanity does not have a clue about what the next ten years is going to bring in technology.

You know, if we can get fusion up and running, which I think should be a ""Manhattan Project"" level of effort, problems like global warming will simply be transcended. We don't need fusion reactors for this, we have a perfectly good fusion reactor 93 million miles from us. We just need to keep improving our technology to exploit that fusion to the point that we no longer need any kind of fossil fuel. I think we are making good progress in that area.

I think a lot of humans in the world live in poverty and misery because they live in 3rd world nations. Third world countries exist because they have fundamental, insurmountable (for now) flaws and problems in their governments, socio-economics, social ideologies and culture. These problems preclude the given third world country from being able to form stable governments, affluent economies and social order. Consequently these countries, with vanishingly small exceptions like the (current) strongman and his coterie, have no money for anything. Their people live in grinding poverty in lives that are ""nasty, brutish and short"". They are too tied up with corruption, tribalism, sexism, social hierarchies, religion derived inequities and an almost total absence of science and technology. Except for maybe mobiles and effective, but primitive weaponry. Do we have that kind of mess in the USA and Belgium? No, and don't try to argue that we do. 

BTW name a USA president you do admire. I'm just wondering. If you can't name one, then I think your problem is one that we can't resolve. 

I don't know too much about Belgium, but I suspect that Belgium has extremely high standards of lawfulness and respect for democratic process. I also suspect that Belgium is heavily dependent on fellow EU countries, particularly Germany and France to maintain its high level of affluence and stability through trade. 

I think UBI might well work in Belgium. Has it been proposed?

I don't understand the point of your last paragraph, it contains a variety of ideas but I can't tell what your intent in communicating that information to me is.

[–]izumi3682[S]
5 points 3 months ago 




We are now at the point of our technology where within 10 years all SDVs will operated at level 5 autonomy. To me the absolutely most dangerous technology in the world is level 4 autonomy. That's where the car notifies the human to take over, hopefully in time. There is a reason that Waymo desires that all future vehicles do not have steering wheels, accelerators or brakes. Humans have no business manually operating any vehicle. Until today we had to suck up our death tolls and live with it because we didn't have a choice, but now we have a better way.

No I think the real problem is that after having driven our ownselves for over 100 years, we do not want to give up manually controlling our vehicles. We are fully confident of our driving skills and other persons driving skill. Of course our human caused driving fatality statistics give lie to this false thinking. 32,000 USA citizens killed in human caused MVAs in 2017. Somebody once said, what, ""that's the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 airliner crashing every week."" We would freak with that! But we seem to be ok with the steady drip of 32,000 a year.

We are also afraid. When we drive we feel in control of things. When we are not in control it feels somewhere between distinct unease and white knuckle terror. But humans who have ridden in level 5 SDVs report that mostly it is boring and sleep inducing. I would add that we are also very afraid (maybe rightly so) of the narrow AI making this all possible. Now there is a ""cat"" you can't put back in the bag. It's gonna get crazy in everything, not just cars.

And this technology is improving by the week, if not by the day.

The part that comes up short in self driving cars is the humans. Humans should get into an SDV, tell it where they wish to go, and be delivered to their destination in safety and comfort. 

Drivers ""education"" will go the way of the buggy whip. And won't be missed.

Through most of history crime at the street level has depended on anonymity and the almost zero chance that the perpetrator(s) would be caught. But as the narrow AI exponentially improves and all humans may carry what is essentially terminator level cameras, crime of that nature will be difficult if not impossible to carry out. The narrow AI will get better at predicting. Their will be more narrow AI in surveillance cameras and probably drones in high crime areas. Will crime rates decrease. 

Don't think being inside will help. The IoT will be able to narc on you very effectively too. In a few decades all humans will have the capability to know who anyone is for law enforcement purposes. Just like SDVs today.

I think this will be better for USA society.

So recent is the commercial use of nanomaterials – approximately the turn of the century – that data on their long-term health effects and guidance for worker safety is limited.
 
Haha! At first I instinctively thought 1900. We have to overcome that mindset.

What do you know about the USA? I live in the USA. Age 57. What country do you live in? Are you a college professor? Did you read anything about what I wrote concerning our technological future? The world's technological future? If I was you, I'd worry more about what China (PRC) has up it's sleeve. The USA is a piker.

I have edited numerous times in the last 12 minutes. Reread please.

they vote always for arrogant ruthless warmongers as presidents.
 
I did not think Barack Obama, a two term president to be, well, what you quoted above. You demonstrate strong personal emotions that are not helpful to reasonable discussion.

Removing poverty is not good enough. The goal of post-scarcity is to enable each human to reach their fullest personal potential in a world where there will be little to no employment. If the technological unemployment rises to say 25% there is little to no employment available for the mass of USA citizens.

I also fear you would favor implementation of draconian rules that would potentially do more harm than good. We are not trying for a ""worker's paradise"" here. The point of UBI is absolutely no limitation whatsoever on what you may spend it upon. Anything else is centralized control of USA citizens. 

Bear in mind that the owners of the ""means of production"" would have no one capable of buying their products or services. I think what we need to do as we move forward into the future is reconsider that the ""value"" of something, as far as how much money it is worth, should perhaps be removed from the equation. Then again that might take a bit of a ""soft"" singularity in and of itself. It is hard to change a 6000 year old habit. Nevertheless I think that is what will happen. 

The AI, robotics and automation we have today, and remember it is as primitive today as it is ever going to be, is going to easily consume pretty much any vocation. Think about that. If no one is going to work anymore, how many custodians do you need. In the next five years you will see the development of bipedal humanoid robots that will be able to reproduce the vast majority of the physical movement humans make to accomplish a task. The robots will be narrow AI. They wont miscalculate. They won't be distracted by thoughts. They won't have any kind of physical impediment that limits movement. They will have superb mapping and intrinsic AI, think level 5 autonomy SDVs but walking around instead. They will see you and greet you.

I see the robot ""Sophia"", who is also learning to walk, as a placeholder for the tsunami of humanlike robots within the next ten years. I have no doubt that ""Sophia"" will learn to run, jump, do backflips and pretty soon have highly sophisticated narrow AI/machine learning that might be mistaken for AGI running her.

Already today large areas of research have been turned over to narrow AI. The development of new applications of molecules for pharmaceutical research is almost being done in it's entirety by AI and automation. New applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are being jointly developed using human intelligence and AI to form a team that can produce in months what used to take years if not decades.


needless poverty and inefficient economic systems (banking, taxation) exists now and should be removed now.
 
I'm in full agreement with you on this point.

No, it appears to me the sticking point is the 1%. They own the money equivalent of the next 70% of humanity combined. And therein lies the real problem. They have unseen control and no wish to change the system. This could be of potential extreme danger because if there is for example a massive societal upheaval in the USA, they may simply use the AI to starve/disease most of the protesters to death in about 6 months. This is what I really, really fear. Your first inkling that something went bad wrong would be the cessation of electricity and no form of electronic communication. But that would be just you, not the 1%.

And I don't see any easy answer either. I hope we can join the AI to our minds in a way that every human on Earth can benefit. And yes we are also working hard on such technology today too. It is a race to see what comes to fruition first. Ergo my ""knife's edge"" filter approaching.

"[Table] I am Dr. Buzz Aldrin, back again on reddit. I am an aeroastro engineer, and crew member of humanity's first landing on the moon. AMA!**Verified?** *(This bot cannot verify AMAs just yet)*

[Robots are revolutionizing a lot of industries, such as Moon Express, a company that is putting a robot on the moon. How are robots going to help us get to Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo661g?context=5)|I have a particular interest in Moon Express because my younger son is the president!  I am hoping we can develop the large fuel capacity of their spacecraft to depart earth and head at Mars on July 4th, 2019, and land on the moon Phobos. That's the 50th anniversary of the first landing on the Moon, and to demonstrate a private enterprise moon landing, to be able to be a precursor demonstration during a significant historical anniversary, might be used to commit to American-led permanence on Mars within 2 decades. The Moon Express is a non-human mission, of course, but it is leading the way. I think that time exploring and further investigative missions of Mars might stimulate human occupation and return. Human occupation, lengthy surveys of essential landing sites, and returns. This might include a non-human but very humanlike robot that needs to be fed - probably oil, haha! And electricity.
[Do you play video games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6gcy?context=5)|I'm not even very good at Pac-Man!
 |And I'm trying to understand the great fascination with the lack of realism in most games that involve competitiveness resulting in violence.
 |Fortunately, the challenge of Aldrin's Space Program Manager involves the participant first researching what's actually needed. But it was the challenge and competition, why did the competition fail, what were the significant changes that made the final well-managed program successful... there will always be refinements in retrospect that should promote satisfaction in the game-player, that actually would be useful in future exploration.
 |I hope the game will be translated into Chinese and other international languages, as the US in the future does not compete but rather works with all other nations in their advancements in the same subjects: **s**cience, **t**echnology, **e**ngineering, **a**rt, and **m**athematics. 
[What was your state of mind and what were your thoughts when you were flying towards moon? And how did it change, when you landed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo664z?context=5)|I was open-minded in anticipation watching the earth grow smaller, the moon grow larger... but all of us were totally surprised when the larger moon totally eclipsed the sun.
 |And we were in the shadow of the moon.
 |Satisfactory photographs unfortunately were not produced.
 |The black sky was different, especially on the surface of the moon. Because from earth, the surrounding light is visible when looking at the night sky. In space, the sun is always affecting the night sky. But on the surface of the moon, the sun's light gave a pronounced velvet-like sheen, such that no stars were visible, especially in the vicinity of the earth. The stars were visible en route, but away from the sun, the stars were very visible, but on the surface of the moon, the ambient light enabled stars to be seen through the telescope but not through the visor cover on the eyes.  
[When have you realized the huge significance of your journey for the first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66a9?context=5)|Well, I realized that before the mission, and wanted the symbolism in the form of our mission to include the national, worldwide pledge for advancement. But I was fully satisfied approaching a landing on the moon, especially when training personnel suggested the eagle carry the olive branch of peace. Following a successful landing, a personal gesture of thanks was achieved by the limited spiritual sacrament of personal communion - I asked people of the world to give thanks in their own way. And my way was with a symbolic wafer. 
[Do you think NASA's rocket explosion this week will hurt them or will be a sign to Congress that they need more funding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6q00?context=5)|Well, I hope the latter is true!
 |But for the reason that to prevent failures, that instead avoid short-term political and other causes that produce short-range objectives, such as the M (Asteroid Retrieval Mission), and the heritage component (old stuff), mandated by politically-motivated Congressional laws.
 |Similarly, absurdly, policies such as forbidding NASA employees to speak to Chinese space personnel instead of the U.S. instituting a Chinese cooperation in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and beyond, for human missions for peaceful purposes.
[Dr Aldrin.  How do you feel about the commercialization of space? With private space companies being in the spotlight recently especially with the antares rocket failure yesterday and the NASA contracts awarded to spaceX and Boeing where do you feel that private companies fit into our future in space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66pc?context=5)|I believe that just like the government US mail delivery, by aircraft, stimulated the government assisted development of the world wide airline industries and other aviation evolution, the pioneering government (and still, in some countries) the military influence on space progressive development is very natural and most economical, and I believe in the present situation the elimination of monopolies between large companies and the overall reliance on government continuation of extensive rocket evolution has stalled, to the great detriment of the U.S. heavy lift rocket for human missions to Mars. 
[Have you ever played Kerbal Space Program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6k7k?context=5)|No... It was many years ago, I think there was a game called Buzz Aldrin's Adventures in Space, something like that - it was a simplified precursor. The eagerly anticipated Space Program Manager, planning future international human activities on the moon and future US-led activities on Mars leading to permanence on the surface, has yet to come. 
[What are your thoughts on extraterrestrial life forms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6q2m?context=5)|As Carl Sagan noted, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""  Personally, I strongly believe life forms exist with some abundance throughout the universe. But the tremendous distances involved in the immenseness of the universe make discovery problematic in the near future, and visits by either us or them extremely improbable. 
[What inspires you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6pkf?context=5)|On the one hand, it was my commitment at 17 years old to serve my country at West Point. On the more futuristic end, to support moving systems for all exploration and all innovation for the benefit of humankind throughout the universe (*please read my science fiction, Encounter with Tiber).
[Hello Buzz. Question: Did you get to meet Yuri Gagarin or other cosmonauts back in the day? If so, what were they like? If not, would you have liked to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6pnp?context=5)|I, like many others, would have liked to have met Yuri Gagarin, but I did enjoy presenting an award - an Explorer's Club award - to Valentina Tereshkova after having hosted two cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov, and of course everyone enjoys the boisterous overbearing humor of Alexey Leonov. 
[Mr. Aldrin! Thanks so much for doing this AMA. I love the work you do as an ambassador for science to the public.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8d62?context=5)|Oh. I very much like your remembering that timely combining popular music with historic events. And its participants, especially the use of your descriptive word of ""ambassador."" I am presently engaged in a search for the lyrics of ""Get your Butt to Mars."" Soembody is going to make a lot of money with the next version of Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon!""
[In 2010 you worked with Snoop Dogg to make a song, Rocket Experience. What was that like, and will we ever see a return of your hip-hop alter ego, Doc Rendezvous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8d62?context=5)|My rap will be outmoded by then. 
[How was it walking in the space suit? Had it tendency to bump you up when you were getting up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66w7?context=5)|The mobility was limited by the flexibility of the suit, and its operation in 1/6 gravity simulation in neutral buoyancy created too much viscous drag. Actual mobility was quite easier than anticipated.
 |For much longer treks, the mobility of a rover was essential! A vehicle. 
[I've always wanted to come as close to feeling that as I could. Is there anything I could do on earth to replicate the feeling of doing a space walk in a space suit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo7rzx?context=5)|Yes. Put on a scuba wetsuit, with appropriate weights, and hold your nose when exploring the new world under the surface of the ocean. 
[What was more satisfying, landing on the moon or punching that moon-truther right in the kisser?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6ijt?context=5)|*chuckle*
 |Both created considerable, favorable support of my activities. However, one involved the relationship between human beings, and the other a historic giant leap for mankind.
[What is your opinion on Voyager 1's recent success of leaving our Solar System?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo66g5?context=5)|Well, I think that is a cardinal achievement in the progress of humankind outward, humankind's creations going beyond the solar system.
[The most important question of the day: What is your favorite food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6jed?context=5)|Hot coffee for the first time in space. It wasn't Tang. But the mini-shrimp were edible when squeezed through the plastic bag! 
[You are in really good shape. What's your daly exercise routine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo6q3b?context=5)|Reading my email and the newspaper in bed, having breakfast.
 |However, I do walk rapidly through the airport! 
[Mr. Aldrin, I'm a science teacher and I have this poster of you and all the Apollo astronauts on my wall.  Every year I try to tell kids about what you did and how much it means to humanity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8fgu?context=5)|Encourage the understanding and celebrating of the achievements in the past, approaching the 50th Anniversary of Man's First Landing on the Moon.
[Is there any message you have for children, or anything I could say to them to give them hope?  There's no longer excitement for discovery.  What can I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo8fgu?context=5)|This could be an ideal time for a reasonable president to make a Mars commitment that would go down in history.

Thanks Buzz! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ks6kj/i_am_dr_buzz_aldrin_back_again_on_reddit_i_am_an/clo77f5?context=5)|I sure do. It's come highly recommended. And I regrettably missed the premiere of the movie about Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything.

Russian spacecraft carrying humanlike robot docks at ISS: The robot named Fedor will test skills and aid astronauts on the International Space Station
"Use of Runaway Cover in Westworld Super Bowl Ad was Incredibly Fitting. Here's Why:**Background**

During the Superbowl, a trailer [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM7tZOLT1qk) for Westworld season 2 was released, featuring a piano cover of Runaway centerfold. It depicts the humanlike robots taking over the man-made facade that is the Westworld theme park, overthrowing humanity to create a world for themselves. At first, I thought the music was pretty [wack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ENmME9RoVg), considering (A): it was a piano cover, not the original version, and (B): they cut through parts of the song, messing with the continuity (even fucking up the iconic piano chords in the first 10 seconds). 

However, I later realized the song choice was genius, considering what it represents within the context of the plot. 


**Explanation**

Runaway, and Kanye in general, is known for extensive and innovative use of the human voice (E.G. [this classic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJyhKEZ8QU)). The original version features complex layering of voices, often edited through auto-tune, or changed to mimic musical instruments. As Kanye probably intended, it showcases the versatility and beauty of the human voice, allowing it to resonate with the listener. In the context of season 1 of the show, the original version could represent a symphonious harmony between man and machine, since the song is made electronically, and voices are engineered in parallel to instruments. 

BUT the trailer uses a *piano* cover, completely abandoning the human aspect, which mimics the plot of the show transitioning into season 2 as the human-like machines become independent. Music made by a piano can express characteristically human emotions, but it is the sound made by an instrument -a machine-. The cover represents an instrument replicating a beautiful human work (or harmonious human voices aided by machines), creating something different that can still show and evoke emotion. This is similar to themes explored in the show, such as the questions of ""what is consciousness/emotion?"" 

I am guessing that the choice of music accompanying the trailer was intended to be more than just aesthetic appeal. They wanted a song that held thematic significance, and they found a perfect match. 
 

TL;DR: The original version of Runaway represents human beauty or harmony with machines, hence the piano cover in the trailer represents a machine replacement that still shows emotion and human character. This perfectly aligns with the plot of the show and the themes explored in season 1.

"Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot raises critical considerations – however in all probability not those you suppose&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56geq2kzgaq71.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b95604a0d4a9351d9a699ac14b5a768c7f4c7f5d

[Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) introduced a humanoid robotic designed to assist with these repetitive, boring duties folks hate doing. Musk recommended it may run to the grocery retailer for you, however presumably it might deal with any variety of duties involving guide labor.

[Predictably, social media](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) full of references to a string of dystopian sci-fi motion pictures about robots the place all the pieces goes horribly improper.

As troubling because the robotic futures in motion pictures like I, Robotic, [The Terminator ](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)and others are, it’s the underlying applied sciences of actual humanoid robots – and the intent behind them – that must be trigger for concern.

Musk’s robotic is being developed by Tesla. It’s a seeming departure from the corporate’s car-making enterprise, till you take into account that Tesla isn’t a typical automotive producer. The so-called “Tesla Bot” is an idea for a glossy, 125-pound humanlike robotic that may incorporate Tesla’s automotive synthetic intelligence and autopilot applied sciences to plan and observe routes, navigate visitors – on this case, pedestrians – and keep away from obstacles.

Dystopian sci-fi overtones apart, the plan is sensible, albeit inside [Musk’s enterprise technique](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/). The constructed setting is made by people, for people. And as [Musk argued](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) on the Tesla Bot’s announcement, profitable superior applied sciences are going to should be taught to navigate it in the identical methods folks do.

But Tesla’s vehicles and robots are merely the seen merchandise of a much wider plan aimed toward making a future the place superior applied sciences liberate people from our organic roots by mixing biology and know-how. As a researcher who research the moral and socially accountable improvement and use of rising applied sciences, I discover that this plan raises considerations that transcend speculative sci-fi fears of super-smart robots.

## [A person with large plans](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Self-driving vehicles, interplanetary rockets and brain-machine interfaces are steps towards the long run [Musk envisions](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) the place know-how is humanity’s savior. On this future, vitality might be low cost, ample and sustainable; folks will work in concord with clever machines and even merge with them; and people will grow to be an interplanetary species.

It’s a future that, judging by [Musk’s numerous endeavors](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), might be constructed on a set of underlying interconnected applied sciences that embrace sensors, actuators, vitality and knowledge infrastructures, techniques integration and substantial advances in pc energy. Collectively, these make a formidable toolbox for creating transformative applied sciences.

[Musk imagines](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) people finally transcending our evolutionary heritage by applied sciences which are beyond-human, or “tremendous” human. However earlier than know-how can grow to be superhuman, it first must be human – or no less than be designed to thrive in a human-designed world.

This make-tech-more-human strategy to innovation is what’s underpinning the applied sciences in Tesla’s vehicles, together with the intensive use of optical cameras. These, when linked to an AI “mind,” are meant to assist the autos autonomously navigate street techniques which are, in [Musk’s phrases](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/), “designed for organic neural nets with optical imagers” – in different phrases, folks. In Musk’s telling, it’s a small step from human-inspired “robots on wheels” to humanlike robots on legs.

## [Simpler stated than accomplished](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)

Tesla’s “full self-driving” know-how, which incorporates the dubiously named Autopilot, is a place to begin for the builders of the Tesla Bot. Spectacular as this know-how is, it’s proving to be lower than absolutely dependable. Crashes and fatalities related to Tesla’s Autopilot mode – the most recent having to do with the algorithms struggling to acknowledge parked emergency autos — are calling into query the knowledge of releasing the tech into the wild so quickly.

A sequence of crashes involving Tesla’s autopilot know-how has prompted a federal investigation.

This monitor document doesn’t bode properly for humanlike robots that depend on the identical know-how. But this isn’t only a case of getting the know-how proper. Tesla’s Autopilot glitches are exacerbated by human conduct. For instance, some Tesla drivers have handled their tech-enhanced vehicles as if they’re absolutely autonomous autos and didn’t pay ample consideration to driving. Might one thing comparable occur with the Tesla Bot?

## [Tesla Bot’s ‘orphan dangers](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)’

In my work on socially useful know-how innovation, I’m particularly serious about orphan dangers – dangers which are arduous to quantify and simple to miss and but inevitably find yourself tripping up innovators. My colleagues and I work with entrepreneurs and others on navigating a majority of these challenges by the Danger Innovation Nexus, an initiative of the [Arizona State College Orin Edson Entrepreneurship](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) \+ [Innovation Institute and International Futures Laboratory](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/).

The Tesla Bot comes with an entire portfolio of orphan dangers. These embrace doable threats to privateness and autonomy because the bot collects, shares and acts on doubtlessly delicate data; challenges related to how persons are possible to consider and reply to humanoid robots; potential misalignments between moral or ideological views – for instance, in crime management or policing civil protests; and extra. These are challenges which are hardly ever coated within the coaching that engineers obtain, and but overlooking them can spell catastrophe.

Whereas the Tesla Bot could seem benign – or perhaps a little bit of a joke – if it’s to be useful in addition to commercially profitable, its builders, buyers, future shoppers and others should be asking powerful questions on the way it would possibly threaten what’s vital to them and learn how to navigate these threats.

These threats could also be as particular as folks making unauthorized modifications that improve the robotic’s efficiency – making it transfer quicker than its designers meant, for instance – with out interested by the dangers, or as basic because the know-how being weaponized in novel methods. They’re additionally as delicate as how a humanoid robotic may threaten job safety, or how a robotic that features superior surveillance techniques may undermine privateness.

Then there are the challenges of technological bias which have been plaguing AI for a while, particularly the place it results in realized conduct that transform extremely discriminatory. For instance, AI algorithms have produced sexist and racist outcomes.

[MIT’s Pleasure Buolamwini](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) explains the specter of bias in AI.

## [Simply because we will, ought to we](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/)?

The Tesla Bot might look like a small step towards [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient of superhuman applied sciences, and one which’s straightforward to write down off as little greater than hubristic showmanship. However the audacious plans underpinning it are critical — they usually elevate equally critical questions.

As an illustration, how accountable is [Musk’s imaginative](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) and prescient? Simply because he can work towards creating the way forward for his goals, who’s to say that he ought to? Is the long run that [Musk is striving](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) to result in the very best one for humankind, or perhaps a good one? And who will undergo the results if issues go improper?

These are the deeper considerations that the Tesla Bot raises for me as somebody who research and writes concerning the future and the way our actions affect it. This isn’t to say that Tesla Bot isn’t a good suggestion, or that [Elon Musk](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) shouldn’t be capable to flex his future-building muscle mass. Utilized in the fitting approach, these are transformative concepts and applied sciences that would open up a future filled with promise for billions of individuals.

\[Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletter to understand the world. [Sign up](https://billioneerstory.com/elon-musks-tesla-bot-raises-critical-considerations-however-in-all-probability-not-those-you-suppose/) today.\]

But when shoppers, buyers and others are bedazzled by the glitz of latest tech or dismissive of the hype and overlook the larger image, society dangers handing the long run to rich innovators whose imaginative and prescient exceeds their understanding. If their visions of the long run don’t align with what most individuals aspire to, or are catastrophically flawed, they’re at risk of standing in the best way of constructing a simply and equitable future.

Perhaps that is the abiding lesson from dystopian robot-future sci-fi motion pictures that individuals must be taking away because the Tesla Bot strikes from concept to actuality — not the extra apparent considerations of making humanoid robots that run amok, however the far bigger problem of deciding who will get to think about the long run and be part of constructing it.

"Recap: ""War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery"" #1Background: In 2019, the McElroys wrote a tie-in comic for the completely forgettable Marvel Comics event 'War of the Realms,' which was written by terrible comics writer Jason Aaron, currently writing the worst run of Avengers in my lifetime (and I was technically alive for the Bendis years, even if I wasn't exactly reading comics at that age). They also recorded a seven-minute promo thing at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, which I had to watch to write this, subjecting myself to the McElroys' voices for the first time in years. You're welcome.

(Mini-recap of the video: I'm watching it right now, while I type this, and Travis just interrupted Justin talking about how good Clint is at writing comics, to say 'but he's totally unfunny, he has to ask us to help with that.' Really weird, just stops someone else in the middle of a sentence to shit on his dad, who clearly did 90% of the work on the actual comic. Anyway.)

The tie-in is five issues long, and it's the only part of the event I've actually read (except for the tie-in issues of the Superior Spider-Man run from the same year, which is surprisingly good, I recommend it). It's the McElroy's only foray into comics aside from the TAZ graphic novels (aside from Clint who wrote for them for years apparently, something I was only vaguely aware of before this, but explains why this thing is surprisingly good).

(Video mini-recap two: Justin just pulled the 'we have kids!' line! [frenzied audience screaming])

I'll get into the comic itself in a minute, but first...

About the Author: I got into the McElroys in... 2017, apparently? It feels like a fucking decade ago, but anyway. My first episode was Detective Jigsaw, My Very Best Friend, from MBMBAm. The titular bit nearly made me piss myself with laughter at the time. Following that, I got into the whole, uh, family of products. TaZ (Balance was finishing up right about then), the Polygon video stuff, their other podcasts (RIP to CoolGames Inc), you know the drill.

I kept listening for a while after that, but eventually, slowly lost interest. The last thing I can remember listening to was Amnesty, which I gave up on towards the end, when it turned into more bullshit end-of-the-world shit. Also Travis had really started to grate on me by that point. I kept watching new Monster Factory vids when they dropped, but eventually those stopped being funny too, so I dropped that as well.

(If you're combing through my reddit history to find something to dunk on me with, fuck you. I was a teenager, and you're a loser for trying to own me by pointing out that I used to listen to a cringe soy podcast, or whatever.)

These days, I listen to two podcasts: Chapo, and The Adam Friedland Show. I lurk on this subreddit mostly out of schadenfreude. Also I've written [two](https://hawkshawinheritance.wordpress.com/)^1 [books](https://thewinterswill.wordpress.com/)^2, and I'm working on [my third](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56861/ambitions-arrow/).^3

Now we're at the part where I talk about the actual comic itself. About fucking time, I know. The video I watched didn't *really* specify who wrote most of it, but since it's readable, I'm going to assume Clint, with maybe a smattering of Griffin.

Before I start breaking the comic down, I wanna give a quick introduction to the cast, partly because the comic kinda doesn't bother.

* Spider-Man (Miles Morales): It's Spider-Man! No, the other one. I can't say I'm particularly fond of Miles. He's got no real personality to speak of, and the giant marketing push for him makes me want to like him even less, because I've got a bit of a contrarian impulse. Plus, Marvel editors were pretty explicit that they turned a character I *do* like, Ben Reilly, into a villain, *specifically* because having him be a good guy was 'redundant' with Miles running around.
* Hawkeye (Kate Bishop): It's Hawkeye! No, the other one. I do kinda like her, because the 2012 Hawkeye run did a good job of making her likable and giving her a personality. You've probably got some passing familiarity with her, but if not... it's Hawkeye but a twentysomething woman. She's got a bow and some arrows.
* Wonder Man: I like this guy. So does Travis, unfortunately. Apparently he's Vart's favorite character, presumably because he used to be a raging narcissist? He was a classic-era Avenger, his powers involve 'ionic energy,' which is just purple lasers with some Kirby Krackle. Used to be a big-time Hollywood actor as well as a superhero, these days he's a pacifist, because he thinks superheroes do more harm than good.
* Sebastian Druid: Now we're getting into the obscure types. Sebastian Druid was a character introduced in 'Secret Warriors,' a 2008 series written by Jonathan Hickman, one of the only good writers left in the comics industries, and Brian Bendis, one of the worst. He uses magic. That's pretty much all you need to know about him. Secret Warriors is good, mainly because Bendis leaves pretty early on. Also, Sebastian died in the pages of Avengers World, but came back immediately (as in, the same issue) as a ghost. No mention of this is made in the comic as far as I can tell, and he's pretty clearly not a ghost. This continuity error will probably never be addressed, unless Al Ewing develops a sudden interest in the character or something.
* Death Locket (Rebeca Ryder): A bit of a pet character for me, honestly. She's a teenage girl whose father turned her into a killer cyborg called a Deathlok. She first showed up in the not-very-good Avengers Arena, where a supervillain called Arcade kidnapped her and a bunch of other teenage heroes, and made them do Hunger Games stuff. Then she moved to Avengers Undercover, where her and a bunch of the survivors went after Arcade and ended up lowkey becoming villains for a bit. She's the only one who *actually* became a villain, joining the Young Masters of Evil, which is where that series left her. She's not with them in this, though- also entirely unaddressed.
* Balder the Brave: Thor's brother! No, the other one. He's a tertiary Asgard character, who had recently been resurrected at the time of this being written, so half the jokes are about how he doesn't recognize any of these other guys. No real opinions on him, honestly.

(Also there's a talking dog named Thori, I guess? Who gives a shit.)

So, the actual comic:

We start with a recap page that gives the rundown of the War of the Realms event so far. It's honestly not that relevant to the actual story, and also written in that awful unreadable """"""Norse"""""" font that Marvel likes to use, so I'm skipping it.

First actual page: An RV (no idea what that actually stands for, but a mobile home) is driving away from somebody shooting fireballs at it. Spider-Man is sitting in the back and makes note of this.

Hawkeye is driving the RV, and Wonder Man is watching a video on his phone about how to... secure a baby carrier-thing to a car seat, I think? The baby is Thor's little sister, who the as-yet unnamed bad guys chasing the heroes are after.

Death Locket shows up to help Wonder Man with the baby-carrier thing. I can't remember what they're supposed to be called, and it's annoying me. Then we get a look at who's chasing them- a frankly sick-looking sixteen-wheeler (only ten wheels that I count, actually, but I don't think that's a thing. who knows) that's spurting flame from every available truck-orifice it has. Balder shows up for two panels to mention he used to be dead, then we go into a flashback.

Flashback: Thor and Freya (Thor's mom) explain to Balder that Thor (and by extension Balder) now has a baby sister, named Laussa. There's a joke about Freya and Odin having sex. Balder pledges to protect his new baby sister.

The rest of the issue is basically an extended flashback getting us closer to where the comic opens, in the form of a getting-the-band-together montage. So next we go to the BBEG of this event, 'Sindr' (seriously, Aaron? Sindr? fuck off), doing a villain monologue about wanting to Kill That Baby. Freya tells Balder to go save the baby, and sends the talking dog with him.

Balder runs into Miles Morales in Times Square, saving people cosplaying as superheroes from demons who think they’re actual superheroes. Kind of funny, I guess? There’s also a bit here where a character basically turns to camera and says ‘I’m gay, by the way.’ Not literally, but close enough. Obviously I have zero issue with gay representation in media, but this is pretty much the cheapest possible way to do it, by inserting it into the story with zero grace or subtlety, and by making the ‘rep’ a pair of background characters who appear on a single page. The ‘Trans Rights written on a piece of printer paper hanging on the wall behind you as you livestream’ of representation in media. 

Miles gets grabbed by a demon, but Balder saves him, comically mistakes him for the real Spider-Man, and asks for his help. We flash forward a bit, and Miles is explaining that there are roughly ten million Spider-Men running around right now. Which is true, and sucks.

With the help of some rando NPC from the Jason Aaron run on Thor, they drive to a giant Asgardian fortress in Oklahoma, where a guy called Skuld, one of the Norns, delivers a prophecy about how to protect Thor’s little sister, who gets handed off to Balder. There’s a whole page basically dedicated to the ‘Balder mistakes legacy character for their original counterpart’ joke, which is still only kind of funny. The prophecy mentions an archer, a magic user, a cyborg, and Wonder Man, all of whom except the cyborg, Balder recognizes (but mistakes for a different, more popular character). 

Why these specific character are required is never explained, but as far as blatant plot devices to assemble a specific team go, it’s, uh... pretty bad, actually. Whatever.

Cut to Texas, where Kate Bishop is fighting some Z-List villain called Slaughter-Man, a play on ‘manslaughter.’ Maybe he’s an established Marvel character, maybe the McElroys made him up, I dunno, and I’m not gonna check.

Okay, I checked. Apparently he’s an OC! The McElroys have made an actual contribution to Marvel canon, with a wiki page and everything! It’s a shitty pun character, so I’m gonna assume Travis came up with him. 

Turns out Kate isn’t fighting him because he’s a villain, she’s serving him divorce papers, because she’s a P.I., which is pretty funny. Also she shoots an arrow on either side of his balls and threatens to ‘split the difference,’ which is... actually pretty in-character, I guess. Balder and Miles show up in the last panel to recruit her. 

Cut to New Mexico, where Death Locket is at a graduation party... or so it seems. She’s talking with her dad and SHIELD agent Dum-Dum Dugan, original member of Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos, bearer of a killer mustache. 

(Also, sidebar, the art on this comic is... passable at best. Just saying. The McElroys had nothing to do with that bit, so I’m not gonna harp on it, but yeesh.)

Oh, and hey, Black Widow and Iron Man are there! That seems weird, shouldn’t they be trying to save the world right now or something? There’s a generic Marvel summer event going on outside! 

Turns out everyone at the party except Becca are LMDs, or Life-Model Decoys, humanlike robots that she’s programmed to pretend to be her friends, as she lives on a downed SHIELD Helicarrier full of the things, and has no actual friends. Which is weird, because last she showed up in a comic, she had a bunch of villain-friends, including a boyfriend whose powers included hitting people with a shovel. I guess she ditched them at some point? Who knows. 

The weird thing is, you really wouldn’t expect the McElroys to have any idea who fucking Death Locket is at all. She’s pretty goddamn obscure, so presumably one of them read Avengers Arena and liked her, and decided to dredge her up for this, years after her last appearance. That, or Marvel editorial (such as it exists these days) suggested her. But either way, why didn’t they bother to do a cursory check on what her current status quo was- namely running with the Young Masters -before using her in this? Same goes for Druid. 

Most likely answer- the two laziest groups of people in the world are Marvel editors and the McElroys. They have kids, dammit! No time to be checking for basic continuity errors like ‘is this character currently alive or not.’

The whole LMD thing gets revealed when Balder, Miles, and Kate barge into the party to recruit Rebecca, thinking she’s the cyborg the prophecy mentioned, but expecting Deathlok Classic, who looks significantly less cute than Becca. Also it’s not explained in the slightest how they found her, but I guess the Norn probably told them, come to think of it. Becca agrees to help them, because Balder is doing this to protect his family, and she likes to pretend the LMDs are her family, which I guess sort of makes sense? 

Next we cut to Arizona, where Sebastian Druid, inexplicably not a ghost, is babysitting some snot-nosed kid. He accidentally pulls a magic wand out of his knockoff John Constantine trenchcoat and freaks out a cashier and the kid, which gets him tossed in jail. Apparently he can’t magic himself out, or doesn’t get the chance at least, because Balder shows up almost immediately to bust him out, and recruit him for the baby-saving mission. Druid is immediately on-board, because he’s clearly pretty down on his luck. 

(You’d think a SHIELD-trained magic user would be able to get a better job than Literal Babysitter, but whatever, he’s also supposed to be a fucking ghost.)

Cut to LA, where-- actually, hold on. 

These guys are recruiting people from all over the country, but it’s not really clear how they’re getting to and from these locations so fast, particularly with the forces of ‘Sindr’ presumably chasing them and the baby the whole way. And if they have some means of rapid transit, why do they need to take the baby to wherever they’re going in a fucking RV? If they don’t have rapid transit, they’re just... driving back and forth across the country, from NY to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to LA, while being pursued by the as-yet unnamed antagonist, *just* to recruit people? A trip that would take days? When they could just head straight to their ultimate destination? 

Whatever. 

Cut to LA, where Simon Williams, AKA Wonder Man, washed-up actor and ex-superhero, is getting pitched on a TV show about himself by some Hollywood Guy. They want him to fight a knockoff version of the Vision, his sorta-brother, in the show. Also they want him playing himself, I guess- but he refuses, because he’s a pacifist. Which apparently extends to pretend-fighting in movies and on TV? I dunno. 

So he heads back to his RV (is he living in an RV? He was an actor and an Avenger, he should be living in a penthouse even if he has no current income stream, that shit pays. Whatever.) and bitches about it to his agent Joel (is the McElroy fam’s agent named Joel? That’s probably a reference, right?), then Balder shows up to recruit him. 

Cut back to the present, finally. Druid is handling the baby, while Balder tells Wonder Man to go stop their pursuer, but he refuses, because pacifist. Balder is confused because that all happened while he was dead. They cleverly work around Simon’s pacifism by having him destroy a bridge to stop their pursuer, causing thousands of dollars worth of property damage, which is probably worse than just punching whoever was following them, but who’s counting?

Then everybody gets out of the RV on the other side of the bridge to take a look at the guy following them- Ares, god of war! Who, coincidentally, is the father of Alexander, AKA Phobos, who was also a member of the Secret Warriors, the same team as Druid. I don’t think the comic mentions this once, but if it does, it’s not in this issue, which ends here. 

So, that’s the first issue of War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery, the first collective foray by the McElroys into writing actual comics, not “graphic novels,” a pathetic lesser art-form. (Watchmen was originally published in individual issue format, so don’t try to pull any gotchas on me there, nerds.) 

Honestly, not bad. The art is pretty shitty, and the jokes fall pretty flat for me, but then again my sense of humor is so warped at this point that I can only laugh at things like ‘Cumeatsoner Gordon,’ a version of Commissioner Gordon who eats cum. So, your mileage may vary as far as the humor goes. But the overall narrative is pretty solid, the characters are solidly written, and nothing happened to particularly annoy me. 

Since this was actually readable, I’m going to assume Clint did most of the work, which pretty much lines up with what they say in the video about the comic, albeit not in such explicit terms. I’m legitimately curious how they came up with this specific team, considering that Death Locket and Sebastian Druid are pretty obscure characters, but as far as I can tell (and I didn’t look very hard, so I could be wrong), that video was the only place where they actually discussed it, and even then, they barely said anything about the comic itself. 

Tune in... at some point in the future, maybe, for issue number two!

"GregBot deniers, what is your explanation for the post-it notes discussed in Matpat's new theory?WARNING: LONG POST AHEAD!

&#x200B;

I have always been a believer in GregBot, but MatPat's new theory has me 99% convinced sure that it is true.

**The biggest thing for me is the post-it notes. If the Post-it notes were NOT written by Gregory, then who else could they possibly be written be? That is the main question I have for people who are fiercely against GregBot.**

The notes were clearly written by a child based on the poor writing/drawing skills. Also, the notes say childish things like ""Fun Fun Fun"" and ""Friends Forever"". They were definitely not written by an adult.

What other character would be writing about a birthday party that was for ""me""? The birthday party was central to the plot of FNAF 4.

What other character would have a reason to talk about ""all my friends""? This is clearly a reference to FNAF 4:

""These are MY friends"".

""We are still YOUR friends.""

One of the biggest clues is the note that says ""You are \[SOMETHING\] Family."" It definitely looks like it could say AFTON family. But more importantly, what other important family names are there in the FNAF games? The only other major family is the Emily family, and it definitely does not say Emily.

The message ""Why is I"" is another big clue. That message wouldn't make sense from a human. It has to be a robot or an AI that is confused about its existence.

The binary code is important. If these notes were written by a human child, how the heck would a child understand binary code? Especially when they can barely write legibly? The binary only makes sense if it was written by a robotic/computerized child.

One interesting post-it note that MatPat did NOT cover in his video says ""Grown ups only"". I believe this refers to the Crying Child seeing ""Adults only"" or ""Employees only"" signs at Freddy's. He went to his father's workplace all the time. Maybe even the closet he was locked inside (in FNAF 4) had a sign like that on it.

And finally, why would the Afton Family robot dinner table be in the SAME ROOM as the post-it notes? That's certainly not a coincidence. Whoever wrote the post-it notes must be connected to the Afton family in some way. Also, it seems likely that the person who wrote the notes must be someone who has spent a lot of time in the Pizzaplex. That fits well with Gregory being a homeless child who would hide in the Pizzaplex.

Now, I want to debunk some common anti-GregBot arguments:

1. Gregory bleeds in cut dialogue - This honestly means nothing. The FNAF books have already established that robots can ""bleed"". Funnily enough, people once used Charlie bleeding in the books as evidence that Charlie was not a robot... then the third book confirmed that she WAS a robot.
2. Gregory eats ice cream - Again, the FNAF books make it clear that robots can be extremely lifelike. Charlie ate and drank like a normal person for years without knowing she was a robot.
3. Humanlike robots don't exist in the games! - William Afton didn't exist in the games... until Sister Location. Henry didn't exist in the games... until Pizzeria Simulator. Scott has shown before that, while the books are an AU to the game universe, he has no problem with taking concepts from the books and implementing them in the game lore.
4. Humanlike robots are nonsensical - FNAF has gone heavily sci-fi since Sister Location - with things like robots walking around in human skin suits, humans surviving without their internal organs, and even digital circuitboard code manipulating people's minds and turning them into murderers.

So in conclusion, I firmly believe GregBot is true and is the intended meaning of the story. I'm not sure if Gregory is Patient 46, but there is an overwhelming amount of evidence towards GregBot.

I would like GregBot deniers to try and debunk this if you can."
"Binary Domain (2012) | Do Japanese devs dream of Gears of War?Binary Domain is a 2012 third-person shooter developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and was released in the so-called ""dark age of the Japanese game industry"" when the Japanese studios were attempting to appeal to the western markets by copying and pasting Gears and Call of Duty. This resulted in some of the weirdest mixes of the western game design and the eastern game design. Some were successful, like Vanquish and... I think that was the only good one. The others like Resident Evil 6, Quantum Theory, Operation Troy, Bionic Commando, Front Mission Evolved, Operation Raccoon City, Mindjack didn't fair well at all.

Binary Domain is a curious case. It was once considered the latter category of 'failure', but it has later gained a cult following. It is [retrospectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6dUv5kEac) [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OBho8Dtj0) [a ""hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jYsWKwkurE) [gem""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66cTc95XK8), some going far as to claim it is a cursed masterpiece. The reception has changed 180 degrees. I have rarely seen such a shift in public consensus before. After playing it myself,  I think the initial reception rated it just right. People seem to overly gush about it too much just because it was made by the Yakuza creators. Had this game been made by the western studio, I don't believe the same retrospective reappreciation would have happened.

With this said, once the abysmal first two-hour introduction--which was so bad that I almost turned the game off--is over, the game is not bad. It does fair better than a lot of Japanese attempts at Gears of War. It is competent and unique in many areas. This is a generic shooter at the first glance, it has this weird blend of western and Japanese video game quirks and camp. Imagine the Gears of War macho-military team dropped in the background of Metal Gear Rising. So the game is not quite as campy as some of the PlatinumGames' works, but there are some moments that get close to them. It is confusing whether or not some moments are meant to be serious or funny.

For example, [there is a dumb cutscene in which the President holds the meeting to talk about robotics, and in the middle of the conversation, one of them mentions how robots don't know they are robots. Then as if signaled, the guards pull out their weapons on one of the generals. The general panics and the guards begin riddling the general with bullets, who turns out to be a robot.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=412) There are so many absurdities in this single scene that I was laughing out loud, and again, I'm not sure if this scene is dramatic and failing, or meant to be hilarious. They talk about how these super high-tech human-like robots are something they have never heard before. Then why would you destroy it right away when you have the perfect chance to capture it? You would want to examine it, not waste it. Also, if they had already known about the general being the robot, why would you invite him to the meeting and shoot it in front of the POTUS? It is incredibly dangerous. What if the robot took the gun away and shot the POTUS? Why would you not apprehend it in some other safer places?

[Another notable dumb moment in which Rachel plants an explosive on the door and sets it to 10 seconds, warns people ""Fire in the hole!"" and the other two soldiers literally stand around the door as if they have never seen an explosive before.](https://youtu.be/pVYuU3iv-uY?t=2450) Why are they standing there? When the bomb blows up, one of the guys comments, ""I hate when she does that."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? Again, is it supposed to be a moment to make Rachel look badass? Or is it supposed to be a comedic moment? I don't know.

There are so many dumb moments like this. There is a scene where the team gets captured, and they are thrown into the garbage dump to be killed by abandoned robots, yet for some reason, they still have guns with them. Like... the enemies forgot to take away their weapons. Or the police show up or disappear whenever the plot demands to. There is an (optional) underdeveloped, insane romance subplot that cringed me so much.

I actually hoped the game was even more ridiculous. It almost borders on being insane, but not quite there. It honestly feels like written by the anime fan who has watched too much of I, Robot and Blade Runner, and they just borrowed a bunch of concepts from those films without thinking about how the world would function. One of the core conflicts in this story is that the ""Hollow Children"", robots with human-like skins, have infiltrated western societies for decades. It is apparently so hard to differentiate the two, but... is it, though? Again, these beings have been living in the societies for *decades* and they are programmed to not know they are robots. In Blade Runner, it makes sense that it is hard to differentiate because Replicants are biologically no different from humans. In this game, these Hollow Children are all comprised of machine parts. One of the iconic shots from this game is literally a humanlike robot with its face blown up, and its inside is distinctively robotic. Literally a CT or X-ray scanner would be sufficient. Yet this game says these beings have gone unnoticed for decades. Are you telling me not a single one thought to have a CT or an X-ray? None of them went to airports in which the place is full of metal detectors?

Still, there are some strong merits to the narrative. There are story elements that shockingly resemble Blade Runner 2049 that I left wondering if the filmmakers played this game. It has a fascinating world that centers around global warming and robotics. The cutscene direction is great. The dialogue comes across the Japanese people attempting to out-do Gears of War, but I do enjoy the characters, especially the French military robot Cain. The villain twist is a refreshing jab at the jingoistic, chauvinistic military shooter narratives.

However, the real meat of the story is the interactive narrative design that changes depending on the friendship system. It not only changes the endings, it changes how the characters treat the player and who lives or who dies in the plot. The player can select certain teammates to bring into the mission, and it is incredible how much the game considered so many different interactions. Whenever you select, the cutscenes come across as natural. It is cool to watch how the cutscenes change depending on who you bring with you. Although I got the 'good ending', some of my characters ended up dying, I have an urge to replay the game just to get all my characters alive.

There are some discrepancies that are caused by this branching path narrative design though. There is a scene where I meet a Resistance leader, who reveals he fights the government because of their hatred of ""scrap-heads"". ...But Cain, a literal scrap-head, is in my crew, and this scrap-head hating Resistance doesn't respond to him at all. In fact, no one in the Resistance is bothered at all. I think at the very least one of them would question this fact, but no.

You can increase or decrease the relationship bar through the combat, which works great because it uses the core gameplay loop to tell and shape the story. However, I have no idea what's this dialogue system doing here. It is not even the dialogue system. It is just a comm system but with short responses to whatever the teammate is saying. The dialogues are boring and the only choices you have in this dialogue system are ""be good"" and ""be mean."" There is no incentive to ""be mean"". Telling a ""good response"" is so easy to choose that there is no dilemma. It is like that inFamous game in which the choices are insanely binary that it only exposes how shallow the narrative is. Some choices are downright confusing. What does ""Damn"" response mean? Does this mean ""Was that damn awesome"" or ""Damn you""?

What is worse is how the dialogue system continually interrupts the gameplay. Remember how annoying the random radio communication scripted scenes in the Gears games where the player is suddenly slowed down to walking speed even though they should have no reason to move slowly? Binary Domain doubles those moments and it is infuriating. I think the pacing would have been so much better without these sections. It is also weird that my character is a super talkative guy, but in the actual gameplay, he's completely mute for the sake of the dialogue system.

Speaking of the squad interactions, the squad AI is abysmal. Half of the time, my commands are useless. There is one section where the player has to push a fuel tank, and it takes like two minutes to do it. If the fuel tank blows up by the enemy fire, the player has to do it all over again. And my squad wouldn't cover me. I literally ordered them to cover me, and they respond they can't. If they said yes, they didn't do jack shit. So I had to try again and again until I just left my teammate to push the fuel tank. There are frequent moments in which the enemies were shooting, yet my squad would stand there and get shot. I was ducking and shooting the enemies, then my squad just comes over to my position and push me out of cover for no apparent reason. For some moments, I was the only one who was engaging the enemy and the other guys were just ordering me around. The worst of all, my squad for no reason ran over to my firing line and got hit, got pissed off at me, and cut the relationship bar. It couldn't believe how bad this got.

A lot of these flaws could have been remedied had the command system been actually deeper. The tactical depth is a puddle. There are not many interactions the player can do. For example, you can't assign a team to a certain location or flank. These are basic features. I didn't expect Ghost Recon but compare Binary Domain to Army of Two, which has an almost identical Gears combat design and the squad-central gameplay. Army of Two has the cover system as a core part of the gameplay loop, constantly moving around and managing Aggro, pinning down enemies. The cover isn't just used for reloading. The cover is required to strategically fight the enemy, using diverse abilities in a variety of ways, sending your teammates to flank enemies or draw fire, etc. And Army of Two was released 5 years before this game.

The levels are far too constrained to have any strategic depth. Gears of War: Judgment and Uncharted 2 and 3 had vertical, arena-like levels where each encounter was designed with the mind that they are combat sandboxes. In those games, I found myself dodging and rolling rather than constantly hiding behind a cover. In Binary Domain, most levels are just corridors. There is a single memorable sequence in the objective design in which the team has to hold off the enemies until one of your teammates takes a shit in the toilet, and this is a funny escort mission I have not seen before. Other than that, they are all bland.

As a linear corridor shooter, it isn't all that effective and some obstacles are confusing. There is one moment that I got stuck where I have to go to the water pump control room to rescue my team within the time limit. However, the road is blocked with the barrels, and I was trying to shoot the barrels and they won't budge. I had no idea what I was supposed to do until I watched the playthrough and realized what I had to do was use the special attack of my rifle to destroy the barrels. The special attack was mentioned once in the tutorials ages ago. There was no other moment in which I had to use my special attack of the gun to go through a path. The game fails to communicate and telegraph the information that the special attack can clear the way.

The game also injects a bunch of weird minigames and they all control rather clunky. There are a jetski, a waterslide, a SOTC-style climbing a boss sequence, and the last one is especially terrible. 

Regarding the shooting, this is where the game shines. Shooting a robot feels amazing. Most shooters revolve around shooting at organic bodies with blood splashing all around, but tearing parts of a mechanical body is just as satisfying. There are so many different types of enemies. The boss fights are awe-inspiring, although they can drag out too long and overstay their welcome. 

It still has a lot of problems though. If you use the controller because the mouse and keyboard set-up has an atrocious mouse acceleration that never got fixed. Whenever the player rolls and takes cover during the reload, the reload reverts, so you have to reload all over again. You cannot change your weapon during the reloading. These three issues are so 6th-gen that I am shocked an AAA shooter in 2012 has them. The player movement is lackluster and there are so many moments in which I couldn't snap into the cover for some reason.

Another issue is the tearing off body part feature is while satisfying, it barely serves as a feature that deepens the gameplay. In the latter half of the game, I pretty much did nothing but mindlessly blast through every on-screen enemy with the weapons because there is no moment where I was forced to think about proper weapon choice or resource management like any actually well-designed shooter. The upgrade system fuels this problem. Rather than the upgrade being customizing different parts of a gun so a gun can be specialized in your taste (like the recent Doom games), you just increase the stats of the gun. Once you upgrade two weapons, the default SOWSAR and the sniper rifle, there is no reason to upgrade any other weapon. They are so powerful that other guns become irrelevant. Hell, there are even three assault rifles that essentially serve the same function. In shooters, every gun should have a unique function, role, purpose. There shouldn't just be three clones of other guns that just shoot different colored, weaker projectiles. Every weapon should ideally require and reward skill, half the sandbox shouldn't be useless just because they would be overpowered if they are not due to how easy they are to use (hence why automatics are terrible in most games). 

Compare this game to Doom Eternal, which has the player break the armors of the enemies to reveal weak points that require different tactics and approaches, like Binary Domain. However, in Doom Eternal, there are often multiple approaches to dealing with the same enemy, such as Shotgun grenades, scoped Heavy Cannon, and Ballista all being effective at breaking weak points, or Plasmagun lightning and Minigun both being good at locking down rushing Hell Knights, or limited rockets allowing you to pick your battles and skip the dance of combat against a few enemies entirely. In Binary Domain, all you need are two weapons that are good at all things once upgraded and completely remove the actual point of having different guns.

Reading all this, I might sound too negative about Binary Domain. Again, the game isn't bad. It is decent at best. But it just floors me how many people make it out as a hidden masterpiece that I can't help but pull the game down a bit. It has a serviceable foundation for a better sequel or a spiritual successor. Seriously, I imagine a great Clone Wars game in which you play as an ARC trooper fighting against the droid army using this template. It is shame the potential hasn't been fulfilled here."
