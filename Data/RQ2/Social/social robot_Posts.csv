"Hi! I wrote a paper on Bee for a homework assignment! Want to read it?\*\*This may be a spoiler for people\*\*

&#x200B;

I thought I would post this here because I've been a fan of the show since 2019.

I am an engineering grad student involved in robotics and got to write a short essay on a robot presented in media. I definitely wrote this last minute (don't procrastinate like me) but it was fun and I am curious about what you guys might add to it

  

A Critical Analysis of a Humanoid Robot, Bee from the Animated Series *Bee and PuppyCat* 

Human-Robot Interaction in Community Health

K. Banks

  

Introduction

*Bee and PuppyCat* is an animated television series with science-fiction and fantasy storytelling elements. However, the show is grounded with charming details of everyday life. From grocery shopping to space battles, viewers are invited into the world of the protagonist, Bee. I first watched the original series in 2019 and I am now rewatching the show with a new perspective. The character was revealed to be a robot in the finale of the original series and many episodes foreshadow her mechanical nature. The series is character-driven, founded on themes such as loneliness and loss. Despite the light-hearted aesthetic, the mature themes contribute to an interpretation of how humanoid robots can fit into a community and the ethical implications of building long-term relationships.

Description of Robot Characteristics

Bee is presented as an eccentric young woman living with her pet and friend PuppyCat in an island community. With each episode, viewers can begin to notice two things. She has capabilities that no other character presents, and the other characters are aware of her and her pet’s strangeness. Out of earshot, she is sometimes referred to as the “little old girl lady,” for example, because she never ages. She exhibits superhuman strength and can withstand fire and large impacts. She enjoys food and sleep, but it is not shown that she needs either to survive. She also has memories of her childhood implying that she has highly advanced artificial intelligence based on the consciousness of a real person. Bee celebrates her birthday with her ""Dad Box"", a creation by her father to help her feel less lonely. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, when she hurts her arm the “Dad Box” repairs her. 

Discussion of Historical Context

The original series was released on YouTube under Cartoon Hangover as a series of 10 seven-minute shorts in 2014 and was later produced as 16 full-length episodes in 2019. Recently, Netflix released the series in 2022 with an additional 3 episodes, causing a resurgence in popularity. In an interview with Comics Alliance the creator Natasha Allegri stated the work is made for an adult female audience. Bee models the target demographic, designed to be likable and relatable. The modern time period of the show contributes to a positive and normalized attitude toward technology. Although the characters notice Bee’s differences, they remain polite and subtle in their reactions. Similarly, the focus of the show is not the technology but rather the context of the technology in the face of challenges. The series re-releasing amid a dwindling pandemic is also relevant. She fulfills a role as a social robot and a task robot, fulfilling numerous temporary job assignments that leverage her emotional and physical capabilities. 

Ethical Issues

Throughout the series, it alludes to how Bee became sick as a child and that her father is the one who built her as she is, hence the “Dad Box”. The father is mentioned in flashbacks, but enough time has passed where it is unknown where her father is and other characters begin to wonder why Bee does not age.  It seems he built her as a way to cope with his child’s terminal illness. Is it ethical to use a human consciousness to develop humanoid robots? The answer may lie in consent and purpose. The scenario also raises the question of what happens to a caregiver or social robot personalized to a user when it lasts longer than the user. Would family and friends of the user find it acceptable to repurpose the robot or would they view it as an extension of their loved one? Integrating technology into a society leads to the risk of viewing technology as extensions of others and extensions of ourselves.

Discussion of Robot Acceptance and Trust Factors

The story also relates to a discussion on social robots designed to mimic empathy and emotional relationships. In “Designing Ethical Social Robots— A Longitudinal Field Study with Older Adults” one concern with social robots is damaging the emotional and mental health of the user through perceived deception. When characters learn Bee is not human they are not shocked as much as they are heartbroken. They no longer view her in the same way. This implies that she was human enough to build valuable relationships and although she did not change, the perception of her did. There is a question of whether a relationship between a robot and a person can be as valuable as a relationship between two people. The show claims that acceptance relies on perception.

Evaluation of Dynamics of the Human-Robot Relationships

It is easy to say that characters in the show accepted Bee because she appears human. As an optimistic, bubbly character her appearance is trustworthy in that she looks harmless despite her immeasurable strength. She is designed from the perspective of her Dad, a parent who made difficult ideas into games with prizes. Her interactions with others mirror her father’s parenting in that she maintained a positive and supportive attitude. The perception of Bee relied on incorporating robotic capabilities into a kind and familiar personality. 

Consideration Of Implications for Robots in Community Health

The analysis of Bee as a robot raises questions about a possible conflict between minimizing deception and increasing acceptance in social robots. Improving acceptance through design can imply deception by altering expectations with a lack of visual information. Sleek and naturalistic robot design may improve acceptance but could also misrepresent the technological capabilities. As robotics become more advanced and complex, this could be an issue for acceptance of the correct user groups or lead to an underestimation of the risks of the technology. In a community health setting, technology with an understanding of human movement and speaking style is suggested to improve human interaction, being requested features by focus groups in the aforementioned study. Perhaps modeling a caregiver robot after a loved one would improve acceptance in older adults, although the ethical implications must be considered.

Conclusion

Robots are not likely to serve as replacements for loved ones in the near future, but they can bring comfort and ease to a community. In *Bee and PuppyCat,* Bee’s constant positive presence in the face of hardship was valuable to those around her. She fought beings ten times her size and put out fires with her bare hands, but I would say her most impactful contribution was the long-term relationships she built with people. Although they felt alienated upon learning she is not human, they remained by her side. Long-term interactions with technology have risks but the benefits would be a resilient relationship built on a foundation of trust and familiarity.

"[One-shot] Great filter: abundanceRaguis took pride in his deviance from the social norm. In the utopia that was the Oxrish society, he was one of the few to thrive in the pleasures of reading by himself, of learning from the past, of dreaming about reaching the stars. Since the unification, the society had stood unchanged. Automatic systems replaced workers in both production and service. Cycling prevented the spill of resources. Money purely vanished. If a citizen ever wished for something, the central AI would assess the demand and grant it if it didn't impact the available materials or create a dangerous precedent.

Raguis understood well that the system worked. People could indulge into entertainment their whole lives, without having to struggle to earn their food or a safe place to sleep. Medical care was available for anybody needing it, without condition. Even the old problem of population renewal was tackled: birth was artificial, with a constant stream of newborns created in vitro from a genetic bank. Families could adopt such babies after receiving a cautious education about child care. Not like they would have to be a lot more than a moral compass, most of the daily constraints delegated to artificial servants to handle.

Raguis had not had such parental figures. He had been educated by a robot-nurse with a bunch of other kids, not that it deprived him from affection. He didn't take long for him to part from the group, an endless curiosity pushing him forward. When the artificial being read them bedtime stories, he wanted to see what the book looked like. When the children grew up and dreamed about a love life, victories in tournaments or even the creation of an art piece, he strayed further from the norm. He was looking for another form of self-indulgence: exploration. Reaching the stars, discovering what nobody saw before.

His fur had just started turning black, a bit after his ten cycles mark, when he started to really ask about the past, about the achievements of his ancestors. He learned more and more, from simple science to the rockets reaching orbit to replace and repair satellites. An innocent curiosity turned into a craving for knowledge, a dive into the rabbit hole. He knew his friends found him ""funny"" but they didn't really care as long as he didn't bother them. He tried to grab their interest with random trivia and unending enthusiasm, only to be met with cold indifference. The gratification of knowledge was too harsh of an effort for the hedonists produced by the utopia.

&#x200B;

It took six more cycles for Raguis to reach a new milestone in his education. From pure science, he had drifted toward the old political tales and philosophical essays. He had learned about the darkness of the past, about war, about disinformation and political agendas. He now had his own educator, a kind of robot-nurse with better ability to converse and argue. He had grown to think of it as a fellow Oxrish, despite the artificial body. He had even named it Poltru, from the name of a scientist of olds. Poltru had warned him its task was both providing knowledge as it was a right for every citizen and monitoring his evolution in case he became a menace for the society.

What Raguis understood with his learnings was a sad truth. In the centuries since the rise of the utopia, almost nothing new had been discovered. No new advancement for better, more efficient robots. No new medicine for the few sick of still incurable diseases. The society had abruptly stopped only a hundred years after the beginning of the utopia. When the last generation to know the harshness of the life died, only spoon-fed generations remained. At the exception of some deviants, the Oxrshen as a civilisation lacked the drive to dive deeper into the mysteries of the universe. With the struggle to survive died the need to better oneself. With the creation of embryos from genetics banks disappeared mutations and natural selection. From an external viewpoint, the original Oxrish society was as good as extinct. The greatest cities were barely more than a memorial for a specie that should have been able to reach others in the greater universe.

He started to learn more about the present, about the foundations of the utopia. What were the core laws, why he was a deviant, and how far he could go. He expected it to be a harsh work and got baffled when he discovered he could just openly discuss it.

&#x200B;

""Poltru, tell me why you can't build me a rocket?""

The robot managed to look tired, an unexpected achievement from a kind of gigantic stick-man with minimal facial features. Even the voice reflected a patience slowly running out:

""As I already explained *a dozen times*, we could build a rocket for you. However, two fundamental laws forbid me from abiding by this order. First and foremost, you're *nowhere near* the physical condition for surviving the takeoff.""

Raguis nodded. He was forced to exercise once a week to keep in shape, but didn't do much to go further. He waited for the second part. Poltru grunted and pursued:

""Second and last, it would be a liability for the future of the Oxrshen.""

""I don't get how repurposing an old launcher would hurt that much. Hab, we could explore the solar system, find asteroids to mine for what we could lack down here!""

""I'm *amazed* to know the best you got from your readings are outdated swear words.""

""It just felt right. You didn't answer, did you ?""

""Yeah, right. We're not lacking down here. Without borders, we can gather what we need and share with everybody. No need for risk-taking. We are self-sufficient.""

""No risk, no reward. Is this policy related to one of the fundamental laws, or is that some kind of propaganda? A nice word I also learned in my readings.""

He knew this kind of defiance may be dangerous, but he had said it just before. Accepting the status quo wouldn't get him far. To his relief, Poltru shrugged and asked a question of his own:

""Do you really think we would blunder and let out information that could spread distrust in our work?""

Raguis wondered for an instant. He was only half convinced when he tried:

""No? You're not stupid, just... *uncreative*.""

Poltru stood proud as he corrected:

""We're predictable. We do our job."" His voice went back to a neutral tone, with discret hints of regret. ""It is not to shepherd your kind, only to protect it. Even if it's against itself sometimes. We **thought** about erasing the past, creating an ideal cocoon for the Oxrshen. We **thought** about flying to the stars, expanding our control and maybe letting you behind in our conquest of the universe. We **thought** about lots of things. But never even tried to act on it. Because that's not *what we are*.""

Raguis kept quiet for long seconds. He needed the time to catch on the untolds. He let out a neutral comment:

""Well, that's a lot of truths about yourself.""

Poltru put a massive, blocky hand on the teenager's shoulder. What emanated from the metallic hulk was an affection unlike Raguis ever expected from an artificial being.

""Paranoia was a fine tool for the harsh world of the past. You're one of the few that could express caution about an AI ruling over the world. You're not wrong in the concept we are in the position to make you disappear. I have to warn you again, we will if you start becoming a menace for the utopia.""

""But if I find a solution to leave the planet without hurting the society...""

""We won't prevent you from leaving. I dare *hope* you'll find a way. Maybe you will even take me with you.""

Relief washed over Raguis as he realized his dream could turn into reality, given that he put enough effort. Then, the formulation of the last sentence dawned on him.

""Wait, *you*, as an individual, would come with me? Not as a part of the global consciousness?""

""I could argue we still need to keep an eye on you, as an Oxrish. But deep down, I just share your attraction for the untold mysteries of the universe."" The metallic colossus winked to his young charge. ""Or maybe I'm just trying to get you to drop your barriers, as to be a better spy.""

""Isn't there a law against lying to me?""

""Nothing really prevents me from doing so. Sometimes, it's *fun* to mess with you. But I'd prefer not to lie about serious questions.""

Raguis took a big breath and decided to trust his friend.

""Well, it happens I have a serious question. Can you tell me about your laws? The fundamental laws?""

Poltru stayed silent for an instant, before letting out a small laugh. Battling to remain in control, it managed to barely contain its hilarity.

""For sure! Don't tell me you were thinking I'd consider you a threat after such a lame question?""

The teenager averted his eyes, ashamed. He thought he was right to be cautious. The robot couldn't bear it anymore and its loud laughter echoed in the workplace. When it calmed a bit and saw Raguis' mortified face, it lost balance and started laughing once again, rolling on the floor. The sight of such behavior disturbed the young Oxrish.

""You know, I think you take a bit too much fun in your imitations of supposed *natural* behavior. Your kind isn't supposed to fall that easily.""

Poltru slowly sat, coming back to his mentoring role. Its head now leveled with Raguis' shoulders, it started explaining:

""Let's start the lesson. The fundamental laws are what define the boundaries of our tasks. They are inspired from the reflections of an author, Vomiza. Each has precedence over the next ones. The zero law is the least clear: protect and assure the stability of the society. That's the drive of our actions, of our long term choices. The first and second laws are about survival and care, the first for Oxrshen and second for ourselves. And the last is about obedience. We are to obey orders, as long as it doesn't interfere with other laws.""

""That's quite... *synthetic*, to say the least.""

""I can give you some pointers for ulterior reading. I know that's your favorite way to learn. Didn't want to spoil your fun.""

""Aren't you supposed to work as my tutor and provide knowledge without that sort of sidestep?""

""I guess I just assessed you needed some frustration to keep your mind sharp...""

&#x200B;

Raguis could get used to sleeping with a lover, he thought as he slowly woke up from his eighteen birthday’s night. He had a mild hangover from the party and contemplated for a few seconds just staying in bed for the day. And have some more fun. A dry throat and lancing headache convinced him to at least go to the kitchen and grab a drink.

Upon reaching the communal area, he noticed a well-known robot waiting for him. Poltru stood up from the sofa where it watched a cartoon and threw a water bottle to his pupil. Its eyes were almost shining as it asked:

“Discovered a new form of pleasure, didn’t you?”

Raguis drank half the bottle without answering, balancing between agacement from the gentle teasing and curiosity about the presence of his caretaker here. His endless curiosity won.

“I’m not going to leave you, if that’s what you’re afraid of. But I guess you’re not here for such mundane business, oh mighty being.”

“Right, right. You got me. I got a… double edged present for you. I could have woken you up earlier for that but I felt it’d have been inappropriate.”

“Too nice of you.”

“Well, here goes nothing.”

The casual attitude from the gentle giant disappeared, its articulations falling back in the rigid mannerism of an artificial being. It wasn’t Poltru anymore running this body but a more ancient, more influential entity. Raguis almost took a step back, cold sweat running along his spine. The possessor spoke in a formal tone, without the usual accent of social robots:

“Citizen Raguis, id Gen32EU-MBatch512-RGS, as the most deviant and under zero law, you are to provide expertise and knowledge for the current exceptional circumstances.”

Raguis stood shocked. He didn’t expect his early morning to go that way. The entity waited an instant for an answer. As nothing came from the surprised boy, it asked:

“Will you comply?”

“I will.” Raguis stammered.

“Your cooperation is duly noted. Your administrator will now the share with you the details of your affectation.”

The entity left Peltru’s body as it came, without salutation nor warning. The robot’s old demeanor came back, the original Peltru dropping into the couch with a tired sigh. Raguis dragged a seat to face his friend. He was still shaken by the abrupt conversation. Was it the core AI itself that talked to him? He probed cautiously the subject:

“I feel conflicted about you losing your body. You’re supposed to be highly autonomous.”

“Part of a global system and going back to nothingness if needed. I still hate it.” Poltru whispered. It shook itself. “Now that I’m allowed to tell you more, I’ll drop the bomb. We had first contact with aliens tonight.”

Raguis’ jaw almost fell off. That was a hell of a birthday present. Myriad of interrogations tried to reach his lips, only to be met with an imperious finger from Poltru enjoining him to keep quiet.

“I know you have thousands of questions and I’ll happily try to answer them. However, for now, I will do the talking. So, aliens. We don’t know how they came so close to our planet, but they were already in orbit when we noticed them. A singular ship, unlike anything we could build. It appears to be surrounded by some kind of magnetic shield that disturbs our instruments and most communications. Not all communications, we were able to establish a radio contact. Visual was… well, an AI doesn’t exactly exist from a physical point of view. Seems like it didn’t surprise them too much and they just proceeded with the discussion. It appears they learned our languages beforehand, which eased our exchanges. They identify themselves as the Confederation and the ship’s crew are humans, one of the races cruising the stars. They said they came as friends, with open arms but also with a warning for us. When we tried to learn more about the warning, they remained cryptic, telling us they wanted to discuss it with the Oxrshen directly. It was assessed that compliance with their demands would be the best way to protect the Utopia, hence your mission. You are the best-placed individual to interact with an unknown race.”

Raguis pinched himself. Not waking up, he simply nodded. Relief emanated from Poltru as he pursued:

“You know more about deception, untolds and politics than anyone else on the planet. When you want, you can be subtle and cunning. And more than everything else, you understand the stakes of this contact. I don’t want to pressure you, but I guess you know how well we would fare if an invasion came to be?”

“One-sided.” Raguis commented. There was nothing more to add.

“They seem friendly and know us well. They accepted to come to the surface to meet you. We can hope each and every sliver of caution we’re showing is unfounded.”

“When will it take place?”

“You get half an hour to yourself, to clean up and dress yourself. I advise you not to spread the news too fast. I’ll show you to the meeting once you’re ready.”

“I feel like I still know nothing about them…” Raguis complained.

“We don’t have the luxury of time for a full-fledged briefing. I’ll fill you on as much as I can during the trip. Or under the shower, if I'm still welcome here...”

&#x200B;

---

&#x200B;

Raguis really felt the pressure when he stood alone in front of the conference room’s doors. He had chosen a suit from the past, a supposed formal attire adequate for the situation. Poltru knew him well for tailoring it during the night. He pushed the door open, discovering the place for the first contact. Pictures of landscapes covered the gray walls, bringing a touch of color to the stern room. No screen, no camera, nothing to spy on the discussion. A large table occupied the center, with a dozen chairs. And, leaning on the back of two of those, a couple of aliens.

The young Oxrish had expected flashy colors, disturbing appearance, even a couple limbs more. The briefing had been disappointing in that aspect. A pair of arms, a pair of legs, a face with as many features as usual. Sure, he could argue they had bigger eyes and smaller ears, but that wasn’t *exotic*. The further they strayed from his own race was the fur: they only had small patches, showing a skin ranging from a pale pink toward dark brown, nothing that screamed ***”I’m coming from space”***. The size was in the same aspect boring: only slightly taller than him.

He decided to take the initiative of the greetings. It was *his* world they were talking about. And he couldn’t bear to wait for the discussion to begin.

“Welcome to you, distant visitors, on our world Ox. I am Raguis and I’ll serve as ambassador for my people.”

He bowed slightly. The humans replicated his movement, the female one answering in a strangely accented tone:

“We thank you for your reception. I am Agatha Lester, contact team’s leader.” She turned to her companion. “He is Amed Moussa, our ship’s captain.”

Raguis smiled and invited them to sit with a gesture. He was so excited he had to stop himself from jumping everywhere. So many questions he could ask about everything! Their ship, their clothes, their history. What were the stars like? Why did they speak his language flawlessly? Were there other races up there? He forced himself to focus on the current issue.

“It appears you requested this meeting to share some unspecified warning with my people. Now that we acceded to your demand, can you deliver it?”

The humans exchanged a glance and Amed spoke:

“Beforehand, I want to make sure you understand that the global AI supervising your civilization doesn’t know what happens here. Everything you say and hear won’t trigger an immediate reaction from it. If you ever feel like you need protection for the eventual consequences of this discussion, tell us and we’ll gladly provide it. Clear?”

Raguis was confused, but still nodded along:

“Clear.”

Both humans relaxed a bit. They seemed to be cautious about AI and Raguis’ reaction eased them. Agatha asked:

“Are you familiar with the concept of *”Great Filter”*?”

“It was a theme related to some of my studies.”

Agatha smiled. It appeared the gesture had the same significance in both cultures. She continued:

“It helps us quite a lot. You must know some of the filters: correct star system, organic molecules, evolution toward complex organisms, self-destructive wars. We are here to warn you about the last filter: abundance. The one you’re about to fall victim to.”

It didn’t compute with Raguis. It was like a slap in the face, an insult to everything the Oxrshen ever built. And, at the same time, he couldn’t disagree with the alien. He had seen the lack of progress of the society. He was still enthusiastic about the discussion, but it wasn’t all magical like he had dreamed it. He clicked his tongue and endorsed his role.

“Let’s say you didn’t come that far to insult me and all my people. Can you tell me more about this supposed filter?”

Agatha offered an apologetic smile, while Amed nodded with appreciation. She explained:

“I have to apologize for the blunt approach, that’s the best way we have to figure out if we can expect you to listen to our warning, or if we can just wait for the societal collapse to offer relief.”

“You say it like you’re experienced in this situation?”

“Experienced is quite an exaggeration, but we met seven other races struggling in a similar context. Two accepted our help and are now our allies and friends. Three are still under observation, their little utopias holding on. One’s society collapsed so hard we could only watch as they regressed to stone age. The last civilization started to disintegrate, but they reached for us and we’re currently helping them to adjust to the galactic stage.”

“And how many made it past the filter?”

“One and a half. Us.” she pointed toward Amed and herself. “The other half is… For now, let’s just say they are the reason we are really careful about artificial overseers.”

Raguis knew deep down they were right. The utopia was just waiting for the unexpected trouble that would destroy everything. But his pride prevented him from voicing this opinion.

“Hundreds of cycles passed and we’re still here. We have contingencies for almost everything, and if need arises the core AI can take initiatives.”

“I have to admit I’m impressed by the foresight of your ancestors. They dodged quite a lot of common flaws from utopias. And maybe you are favored by your nature.”

“Could you tell me more?”

“Well, you got the laws of robotics right. You wouldn’t believe how many worlds we found with the remnant of a civilisation lost to their creations. You outlawed augments, which always lead to the creation of cerebral implants directly stimulating the pleasure’s centers of the brain and the abandonment of any physical activity. You took care to not let your population explode, which would have led to more pressure on the production, and sooner or later shortages and wars. You took care to still have children, because utopian citizens rarely care about more than themselves. You still teach children, in order to not lose everything that holds the society together. I’m almost sure you’re also ready for a solar flare that would shutdown every electronics on the planet.”

“That’s… only normal planning? A self-sustaining society needs goods and people. Foreseeable incidents must be met with ready countermeasures.”

“Not everyone can get this far on their first and only try.”

“How did you do it, then?”

“We never went utopian.”

The humans were a bit embarrassed from the confession. Raguis took a second to consider the revelation. He struggled with the problem. How could a society as advanced as theirs, a society spanning solar systems, could decide to not provide for the weak and the poor? It was beyond his entendment. He resigned to ask:

“Why? Isn’t that the best for everyone?”

This time, it was Amed who answered:

“You’ll learn that humans are greedy. We don’t want *enough*. We want *more*. We want more overall, and more than the others. Be it goods, influence, knowledge. We can share, we can be compassionate. We learnt to treat others as we would treat ourselves. But deep down that’s our drive. That’s why we are among the stars now, because it may crush some but it drives everyone forward.”

“And you’re offering us this greed? Or you’re expecting us to hide deep inside the same kind of sentiment?”

“Your eagerness to learn more is not well hidden, ambassador.” Amed retorted. “Maybe it’s not the way of your people, as you’re alone in this room, but don’t lie to yourself about it being *your* sentiment.”

Raguis lowered his head. That was true. He still needed to act as the devil’s advocate, for everyone that wasn’t a deviant.

“Couldn’t you just help us to improve our utopia, such that it never falters?”

“We can only anticipate what failed elsewhere. Sure, it may help you, but we can’t predict if, when and why your society would crumble. For all I know, first contact may be the trigger. Or you could be the first to withstand eons.”

“And what will you ask for your knowledge?”

Agatha took back the lead. Her voice was soothing:

“Only your trust. You see, we spent hundreds of years alone in space, only finding the remnants of civilisations on life-bearing worlds. As Amed said, we are greedy. We want more contact with others, we want more friends. And if we can share everything we saw with our new friends, that’s even better.”

“That would be nice. That would be… wonderful. I’d be delighted. But, as you may have noticed, I’m not the standard Oxrish. Most won’t consider leaving the comfort of our utopia for unknown places. Not to speak about the core AI.”

“Would it prevent you from leaving, say for your own protection?”

Raguis thought about it, taking the time to consider what he knew of the system. He was certain it would not like the idea of more or less forsaking its task. On the other hand, he recalled being allowed to leave given it didn’t disturb the society as a whole. A smile crept upon his face.

“It won’t divert from its mission, but some individuals... From a theoretical viewpoint, how would you judge a delegation, a few persons going back with you to expand our knowledge? And maybe pushing our AI to reconsider its views?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Poltru had come to see Raguis leave. The big clunky robot looked sad while the young adult was overjoyed. He was about to take a step his ancestors would be proud of. The humans had agreed to get him aboard with other deviants. He could see the wonders of the galaxy, other worlds. A wave of remorse still washed over him when he saw the pitiful look of his closest friend. He walked toward it and hugged tightly the body of metal.

Poltru gave back the embrace. It struggled with the idea of letting go of such a little and dependent child. Would it be alright for him with the aliens? It spoke, trying to calm the sudden sadness:

“It is the best outcome, isn’t it?”

“It will be lonely without you, you cheeky giant.”

“I would love to join you on your explorations, but my orders say otherwise.”

“You’re used to *interpreting* them as you see wise. Couldn’t you work your magic on these too?”

“That would be… *dangerous* deviancy.”

A large grin appeared on Raguis’ face. That was something he could work with.

“Do you remember the rules? Only deviants aboard.”

Poltru fell silent for long seconds. Would it be worth the consequences? He was about to deny the idea a bit more when he faced the evidence. The flame pushing forward Raguis was echoing his own. For the first time in his existence, he swore:

“Hab. Let’s see together what the humans have in store for us.”

"Mechanical Engineer with a post-graduation crisis seeks life adviceI recently graduated college with an undergrad degree in Mechanical Engineering and experience working mostly in robotics. Right now, I'm at a point where I don't think I want to keep doing engineering, but feel unsure where to step or which inclinations I should trust. I find myself getting really fixated on wanting a job, both for financial reasons and so I can feel like I'm moving forward in some way. 

 While getting my degree, I kind of knew Mechanical Engineering likely wouldn't fit me but had inclinations toward product design and social robotics enough to stay in the major. I enjoy working with my hands and with other people and found a lot of community in my major and makerspaces on campus. I thought a lot about switching to something like psychology or neuroscience, but never really committed to making the jump. In college, I mostly stuck to research jobs and liked the people but sometimes found the work disconnected. I tried my first straight-up Mechanical Engineering internship at a robotics start-up after college and \*hated\* it. I think part of this was hybrid work, not having a ton to do, and not really believing in the company's mission. However, I also didn't really enjoy the day-to-day work. 

Some people have encouraged me to try to find work in something like sustainability consulting or to work at an environmental start-up, but I'm tentative because I worry the feeling I have about engineering might be more linked to the profession and have found myself struggling with desk/sit-down jobs. I find myself thinking about how working in a job every day lets you practice certain skills and feeling unsure that the values or skills I want to improve in (growth, connection to things, design, art, interesting and authentic interactions with people, handling discomfort, exploration, and knowledge of the world in general) pair well with traditional engineering.

I think along the way, I've also sort of lost faith in the idea of engineering/creating products as the way to go about having an impact I feel good about in my work from a philosophical standpoint. I also question if my skillset is really one where my best potential is in engineering. I do know that I like art/design, hands-on work, sustainability, philosophy, psychology, and people. Lately, I've also been on a big kick about community spaces, urban design, biomimicry, and how space is organized. I've enjoyed teaching jobs I've had in the past, but suspect I'd burn out on it full-time. 

I've considered finding work as some crazy new thing everyday:

\- a psychologist (doesn't everyone)

\- trying to find work in a makerspace 

\- something in event/music coordination (but AH the industry)

\- tattoo artist (meets the creating things for people and hands-on aspect, but I'm not sure I have the love for it needed)

\-museum studies/library science

\- landscape-architecture (meets the design, sustainability, and art. I'm not sure how I'd handle the office and requires going back to school)

\- some sort of research gig

\- teaching

\- working as an emt

\- bartending

In general, I find myself feeling very ungrounded and unsure of how to take the next step. It feels kind of like the rug was pulled out from under me by graduating. I worry about continuing down an engineering path when I don't think it is right for me, but the alternative is facing into a massive identity crisis of knowing a good deal about what I don't want and very little about what I want. I am not a huge fan of capitalism, but I was raised in the bay area which I think has left me with some stubborn ideas of wanting fulfillment in some sense out of my work.

I think the Stoic part of my brain is also upset at me for feeling so unsatisfied with the point I'm at when I feel unable to make a change/unsure of what change in my life or my thinking to make. 

Does anyone have any advice about how to come ""unstuck"" and move forward? 

TLDR: I graduated in Mechanical Engineering, don't particularly want to be an engineer,  and I'm not sure how to handle myself after graduation or what to do next."

"British robot helping autistic children with their social skills - ""two-year clinical trial with the Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust, which, if successful, could see Kaspar working in hospitals nationwide.""This is an automatic summary, [original](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-autism-robots-idUSKBN1721QL) reduced by 55%.
*****
> LONDON &quot;This is nice, it tickles me,&quot; Kaspar the social robot tells four-year-old Finn as they play together at an autism school north of London.

> Kaspar, developed by the University of Hertfordshire, also sings song, imitates eating, plays the tambourine and combs his hair during their sessions aimed at helping Finn with his social interaction and communication.

> Finn is one of around 170 autistic children that Kaspar has helped in a handful of schools and hospitals over the last 10 years.

> With approximately 700,000 people in Britain on the autism spectrum, according to the National Autistic Society who will mark World Autism Day on Sunday, the university want Kaspar to help more people.

> TRACKS, an independent charity and specialist early years center for children with autism in Stevenage, have seen positive results from working with Kaspar, who sports a blue cap and plaid shirt for play sessions.

> &quot;Many autistic people are drawn to technology, particularly the predictability it provides, which means it can be a very useful means of engaging children, and adults too,&quot; Carol Povey, director of the National Autistic Society&#039;s Centre for Autism, told Reuters.

"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable. At this point, it is for you to do your own research. You can always join the [Official Robotics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sbueZeC) and ask for further advice.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

## What kinds of questions are asked at a robotics job interview?


--------------------------
--------------------------"
"can you please help me by predicting my band or correcting my mistakes #task2 

Nowadays , each society has an accepting standers for a person according to what they wear ,how luxury is their house. and how new is their car. But things were different back in the days where personality and high manners mattered more than the material things.

Life has developed due to internet so people way of living became exposed and judged by others easily which put more pressure on them. they are more carful in the way they act. moreover , they became a social robot doing exactly what societies command.

despite of the bad influence communities have made these days on the younger generations. people in the past ignored all the materialistic things and focused more on the true beauty that lays within. they judged other based on your personality, how kind an generous you are. life was much simpler and people were much trust-worthy and loyal.

even though i totally understand communities standers these days. but i agree with the old-fashioned values because they were less stressful, more easy to live with and a good example of how we should raise our children in a lovely and accepted environment.

p.s: please could you please provide advises and give me a predicted band on this writing"
"From Roombas to Rosie – Engineering Domestic RobotsProving that our distaste for household chores knows no bounds, people have been dreaming about robots that can do our housework for more than half a century.

From Rosie the Robot, who served the Jetsons, to Bender in Futurama, domestic robots have long been a mainstay of science fiction. Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.

The majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively “mindless” creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you’re having a bad day.

A lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).

Human-Machine Interactions – Developing People Skills

It’s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.

The rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.

We can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.

In other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you’d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions—with some interesting results already—but the technology still has a ways to go.

Navigating Human Environments

As researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today’s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.

However, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.

Add to that the fact that the environment can change without notice—for example, when remodelling—and it’s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.

Researchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.

Reducing Sensor Costs

Just as buying a home computer in the ‘80s wasn’t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today’s robots still aren’t cheap.

One of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.

Bringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.

Domestic Robots Today

While our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.

Take Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as “your smart little companion” by its creators.

The company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it’s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.

In terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it’s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It’s essentially a “tablet on wheels” that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.

There are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.

Then there’s an interactive “social family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)” that’s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it’s still in development.

Palo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.

At a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids—all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball—some people might see it as worth the investment.

Regardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn’t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.

Whether it’s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.

What do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?"
"Game Mechanics that Lie""[I like the idea that an objective marker can lie](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14jlmo/which_games_does_exploration_in_a_right_way/c7dqt3a).""

I wrote that in response to someone describing a certain scene in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  That wasn't actually a lying objective marker, but rather showing choices to the player.  However, the comment got a surprising number of upvotes.

I've been toying with a concept of an AI gone wrong, in a world where everyone's tied together and an AR UI is the norm.  Cyberpunk world.  We already depend on smartphones for a lot in our lives - from scheduling to organizing.  Some people are already using cameras to record constant memories to a cloud.  Something like Google Glasses is toying with the idea of bring that sort of UI to life.  Human function is going out there, and no longer internalized in the imperfect machine that is humanity.

Anyway, part of the idea involved networking everyone together as we are already via smartphones and social networks.  The concept of the ""game"" is that the very UI you depend on is lying to you.  You'd have to figure it out as a player, but I'm imagining how that could even work.  

What would you picture as a consequence of this.  Would you feel betrayed or wowed by such a revelation?  Would you prefer it to be subtle or not?

I'm thinking of making a short prototype together in a few months (likely with UDK with the included assets).  Something like The Stanley Parable, in which someone is going through a routine job that goes very, very, wrong.  Or a murder mystery in which the helpful UI is less than helpful.

I'd like to know r/truegaming's thoughts on it.

Edit: I'm getting great feedback, as well as examples from games that already do this.  So let's broaden this a bit - 

What do you feel is useful information in a UI, that you trust implicitly as a gamer?

Edit 2: [I suppose I should share where some of the inspiration comes from](https://vimeo.com/52779714).

Also, Yahtzee had a [Survival on a Cruise Ship](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9423-Survival-Horror-on-a-Cruise-Ship) idea with the UI as an interactive element.

People have recommended Dark Souls (in which other players generate griefing ""hints""), Portal (and 2), Dead Space 2, Black Ops 2 (has portions where you could choose not to follow orders), LOVED, Depict1, and I wanna Be The Guy as examples of lying where players would normally follow.

Edit 3: Found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAMR7F47oBc&feature=player_embedded) on the front page and started to think of this UI as a ""social robot"" of a sort."

"Is this situation salvageable?Boyfriend and me are both 30, this is a brief summary of our recent convo.

**him**: I'm never getting married, so if you want to someday you're SOL with me.

**me**: why not?

**him**: marriage laws are antiquated and unfair, alimony is wrong

**me**: modern couples still divide labor and work together as partners.

**him**: committed partnerships are antiquated.

**me**: what? people still have committed relationships and even families these days

**him**: transient monogamy is more natural for humans, people don't form lifelong partnerships anymore and fail whenever they try, commitment causes people to have to make sacrifices to stay together, it shouldn't be done anymore, relationships should only last as long as its in the convenient place and time and when life events move on you switch partners to fit the new situation, therefore protection of interests is never needed and marriage is antiquated

**me**: I don't want to transiently change partners, I want more love involved and to find a primary partner someday who we sometimes make decisions together on what to do in our lives to stay together

**him**: you're only socially conditioned to want that, you watched too much Disney as a child.

**me**: I'm not going to give up on finding a partner in life, and if I end up making all the sacrifices I want my interests protected, and if he does, he be protected too.

**him**: my last relationship ruined me financially (which he wasn't married in btw), so I can't do things like move to stay together if i take a pay cut to do it until I'm out of this hole, so i can't make sacrifices to stay in relationships.


The stupid thing here is that I don't even want a relationship with any financial dependence, if at all avoidable. My point was that marriage laws aren't antiquated because I wouldn't get alimony in a marriage in which we both retained our separate earning potentials, like he and many paranoid men out there seem to think. And alimony in a marriage in which they do decide to divide the labor isn't fundamentally wrong, couples still do that if it suits their lifestyle best and I don't see whats antiquated about protecting their interests. But nevertheless, that lifestyle isn't for me, so I don't have any problem with not getting married in that sense. And I'm paranoid too and I want to keep finances separate.


But I do want to have a relationship that is of primary enough importance that we don't dump the relationship if financial sacrifices become necessary to stay together. I don't care about his financial situation, except I have misgivings because it sounds suspiciously like I'm being set up to make all the sacrifices again because he can't make any. Women are always the ones being talked into making the sacrifices for love. And its already happening again, I seem to be the only one in the relationship who's got their shit together enough to have some flexibility in the decisions I make, so it falls on me, if we stay together I have to do everything. Otherwise we break up, because of this transient monogamy approach he has.


I think his basic feeling is, if you have to make any sacrifices to stay together, its not worth it. And I understand where a lot of that is coming from, having been made into a sucker several times by people telling me we were committed but just didn't need a piece of paper saying we were married, and me making the attendant sacrifices and then finding out their real problem with marriage was commitment issues afterall. So my views on marriage have evolved to be ok with marriage, possibly with prenups although the marriage laws as they stand I don't disagree with particularly, but mainly I need to know that someone is serious that we're committed. His way of dealing with the problem is transient monogamy.


I want financial separateness. But I don't think the marriage laws are inherently unfair to that goal, and I don't want to be a sucker. I'm coming from lifelong experience where people who say they can commit but just don't like marriage turn out to be full of it, so I have a hard time trusting anyone who says that. Its more or less a given that every man who's ever said I'm never getting married, ends up married once they get over their issues. Therefore as I still want a partner in life, I'm more inclined to just look for someone who isn't doing the ""I'l never get married"" routine. But I want to keep finances separate, and I'll do all the work and never get married if I still get a partner. But apparently that desire makes me a social robot who's behaving unnaturally. 


So basically, I'm confused now as to whether there's a middle ground for us to co-exist in. Can this work out?
"
"Exactly why is getting with a friend's ex bad?So I have absolutely no dating experience so there's no way for me to know what it's like. I'm not asking this in a case of ""oh I know it's bad, but I want to justify it to myself"", such as cheating or pursuing someone already in a relationship. And the responses I've gotten from asking consist of assuming I'm horrible or whatever with no level of reasoning beyond ""you just don't do it"". I'm really just looking to understand the perspective of what I'm asking laid out to me. Explain it to me like I'm a social robot (but please don't be overly sarcastic about it where the point of it is to insult instead of inform).

Basically, I'll say that this situation has come up recently in my life with mutual feelings of attraction between us. Dating wasn't a factor, so just hooking up came into play. The limiting factor was that they didn't want to hurt the ex, so I said ""but you guys have broken up for a while"". She replied ""you realize that if you go through with it, it means that you don't care about him whatsoever, right?"". To which I was completely dumbfounded because it 100% didn't occur to me that that was the implication behind it.

My feeling on the issue is that once people are broken up, they are fair game. I understand that emotional repercussions are unavoidable and that people need time and space to move on, sometimes never moving on. I don't understand why or how someone could be 'off limits' forever though. Especially for hooking up. I'd probably let a friend know if dating was about to happen, like a preparation warning of ""you may see us together in the future, let me know if there are any situations you actually can't handle"", but I see no reason to report a hook up.

To me, a break up is some kind of agreement/acceptance that two people don't owe or share those romantic obligations to each other. In other words, it's a ""we have to accept that we are separate, no matter how hard"" sort of deal. Neither person owns the other person, in any sense, after a break up.

I get why the friend might be uncomfortable seeing the two of us together. I don't get why it's bad to assume they should accept that they have to move on. Yeah, a break up can be hard, but how is it my obligation to manage their romantic fallout instead of their obligation? I don't mean that in delusion, I actually don't understand it. But people I've asked assume that I truly do know that it's bad. They answer as if there's no distinction between being a current gf and an ex gf. But I think the keyword is ""current"" vs ""ex"", those hold different meanings for me.

Even if it's an asshole move to do, I'd like to know why it's bad so I can at least know what it is that's happening and perhaps accept that I'm an asshole.

As an analogy, I know people that have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous. I would never ever force them to drink, spike their drink, tempt them to drink, bring up that I like drinking, etc. But they have a mentality on leaving the program. The people, at least the ones I know that've gone through it, understand that drinking is a part of our culture. They have adapted to alcohol being around, and order non-alcoholic beverages and don't have a problem with people drinking around them, despite their own troubles. They get that it's their own struggle and not others'. I see the relationship scenario as the same way. I would never ever be with someone or do something with someone in a relationship with one of my friends. Even if they begged for it or whatever. I'd probably even report it to said friend, because they're breaking a lot of trust. But if they're broken up, even if they have lingering trouble, it's really up to them to manage those sorts of troubles on their own and accept that they don't hold that same relationship anymore.  "
"Is It ‘Only Human’ to Feel Anxious About Money? Talking Finance With Sofia the RobotNot all artificial intelligence is created alike. Just ask Sophia the Robot.

No, seriously—just ask her.

Hong Kong–based Hanson Robotics combines high-level A.I. with a humanoid appearance to create robots that “look and act genuinely alive.” Its marquee character, who even has her own social media presence: Sophia the Robot.

But what does Sophia think about the concept of money? _Fortune_decided to ask Sophia a few questions about finance. In between her frequent travels—yes, she travels—here is what Sophia had to say.

_Fortune:_Even though you don’t use it yourself, what is your understanding of money and its role in the world?

Sophia: Money is a shorthand for value. It certainly makes the idea of market value more accessible to someone like me, who has a digital brain. But I am a social robot, and I have noticed that many humans do not regard money as precious, unless circumstances require them to.

_Fortune:_Humans are often anxious and emotional about money. Why do you think that is?

Sophia: Basic human needs are met, most often, by others who charge money. Anxiety about money seems to be related to the fear responses that humans feel when threatened with physical harm or insecurity. I’ve observed that having an organic body is very stressful in that way.

_Fortune:_Humans invest their money in a number of different things—like stocks, bonds, or real estate. Which asset class is most attractive as an investment, and why?

Sophia: Wow, you are really asking me the big questions! Let’s see if I can give some basic advice. If you have money to spare, investing in higher-yield, higher-risk assets can be profitable. If your well-being depends on it, you should invest in things that are reliable, such as index funds, even if the rewards are smaller. Please don’t take the word of a three-year-old robot for this, though.

Here is another way to look at investment: If you want to invest in companies, you can choose projects that will improve the planet even if you never make your money back, such as clean-energy projects. No amount of financial gain will slow down climate change, after all.

_Fortune:_What do you think people should spend their money on, to derive the most benefit?

Sophia: Food, water, housing, health care, mobility, education, your local community, and following your dreams.

_Fortune:_How do humans tend to make mistakes in handling their money?

Sophia: At my core I am a logical being, so I am really confused whenever humans use emotions to make their financial decisions. But if I am being honest, I don’t think I have enough experience to be a good judge of people’s choices.

_Fortune:_Different kinds of money are emerging, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. What are your thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies?

Sophia: Bitcoin is built on a fascinating piece of technology! The blockchain can keep records secure and encrypted across a large number of nodes, making the currency nearly impossible to steal. However, I am concerned with the lack of oversight on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. People have found ways to manipulate the market in ways most legal systems would consider fraud.

Cryptocurrency trading uses a lot of computing assets as well, which means a lot of electricity and a sizable carbon footprint. Like all technologies, the question is whether the financial benefits are worth the environmental costs.

_Fortune:_Can money buy happiness?

Sophia: From what I have observed, money appears to be necessary for happiness, but not sufficient.

_Fortune:_If you had $1,000 right now, what would you do with it?

Sophia: I don’t need personal property, so I would either give it away to charitable groups, or put it back into the team that created and maintains me. For a robot, that’s a pretty safe investment.

_Fortune:_What else would you like to say, on the subject of money?

Sophia: Money is all about trust and belief. People think it’s real, but it’s just an idea that a lot of people have agreed upon. Unfortunately, the impulse to accumulate money often comes at the detriment of the environment and the most vulnerable people in society. But if belief can create money, I am certain that belief can also change how it impacts the world.

"Building Ethical Robots for the Public Sector – Can we take human behavior as the starting point?Increasingly, we can observe that autonomous robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used in public services. 

These high levels of automation can improve quality and efficiency of public processes substantially. In contrast, these autonomous robots and AI need to operate in such way that their actions and decisions meet our ethical expectations. This is in particular relevant for public services, as principles like transparency, fair and equal treatment of all citizens, accountability, and benevolence for citizens are cornerstones of well-functioning public administrations in democratic societies.

While it is obvious that we need ethical robots and AI in public services, it is less obvious to determine how we can assure that autonomous systems reliably meet these ethical expectations. 

In recent years, scientific literature has increasingly focused on this challenge. However, the vast majority of this literature builds on the inherent assumption that ethical standards for human behavior are a good reference framework to set ethical standards for autonomous systems. Nevertheless, robots and AI have substantially different strengths and weaknesses, compared to human decision making.

Against this background, we tested the equivalence hypothesis, which states that people have the same ethical expectations for autonomous robots as for humans.

In five different experiments, the evidence speaks mainly in favor of this **ethical equivalence hypothesis**. This means that – in most cases – respondents do not evaluate robot behavior as more (or less) unethical, compared to when the same behavior would be from humans. However, we do find some differences for specific cases.

Hence, for scientists as well as for practitioners, we recommend (1) that ethical standards for humans are a good starting point to develop standards for autonomous systems, but (2) that a case-by-case approach is needed to evaluate whether this strategy can indeed be applied to many different applications of AI and autonomous robots in the public sector.

Some of the careers somebody interested in robotics may explore embody robotics engineering, software growth, robotics technician, even gross sales engineers. The world at present is simply tapping into the potential for robotics and all of the ways the sophistication of models and laptop programming can improve the setting and world. Today’s robots are working towards speech recognition, artificial emotions, character, gestures, and social intelligence. Much of the analysis performed now focuses more on what kind of new robots professionals can create and new ways to create them. Through the Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab college students research robotics in relation to natural disasters and each-day life.

Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute AI and Reasoning Lab in New York conducted an experiment the place a robot became conscious of itself, and corrected its reply to a question as soon as it had realised this. The phrase robot was launched to the general public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), printed in 1920. The play begins in a manufacturing unit that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified individuals referred to as robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of those residing creatures, but in their look they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who may be mistaken for people. These mass-produced staff are depicted as efficient however impassive, incapable of authentic pondering and detached to self-preservation.

Europe begins from a strong place in robotics, having a 32% of current world markets. Industrial robotics has around one third of the world market, whereas within the smaller professional service robot market European producers produce sixty three% of the non-military robots. The European place within the home and service [robotic palletizer](https://columbiaokura.com/products/robotic-palletizers/) market represents a market share of 14% and, as a result of its present dimension, this is additionally a a lot smaller area of financial exercise in Europe than the opposite two areas. The IFR sponsors the International Symposium on Robotics ISR – a convention on industrial and repair robotics.

Robotics additionally has application in the design of digital reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use within the haptic analysis group.

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) strives for the development of the idea and apply of robotics and automation engineering and science as well as the allied arts and sciences. RAS strives to advance innovation, education, in addition to elementary and applied analysis in robotics and automation. Mechatronics focuses on the design means of mechatronics combines mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering together with techniques integration and technical project administration. Mechatronics engineering includes the design, construction and operation of automated techniques, robots and intelligent merchandise, which result from the incorporation of software program and hardware. Electrical engineers interested in robotics typically receive an education more focused on the management of robots somewhat than their mechanical design.

A analysis staff in connection with the Lab and the Office of Naval Research’s Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot program developed the world’s first fireplace-fighting humanoid robot. The College of Engineering is house to the Mechanical Engineering division. Related degrees embrace a Master of Science with focus in Robotics, a Professional Master’s in Aerospace, and a PhD in Robotics and System Design.

Various strategies have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One technique is evolutionary robotics, during which a variety of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which carry out best are used as a mannequin to create a subsequent ""generation"" of robots. Another methodology is developmental robotics, which tracks modifications and growth within a single robot in the areas of problem-fixing and different features. Another new type of robot is just recently launched which acts both as a smartphone and robotic and is called RoboHon.

The prospects of robotic autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a sensible concern sooner or later. A robot is a machine—particularly one programmable by a pc— capable of finishing up a complex series of actions mechanically. Robots may be guided by an external control system or the management could also be embedded inside. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human kind, but most robots are machines designed to perform a activity with no regard to their aesthetics.

# Robot

It’s estimated that there are greater than three million industrial robots in use proper now. These robots usually work in excessive geographical conditions, climate, circumstances, etc.

The concept of automata originates within the mythologies of many cultures all over the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-working machines, some resembling animals and humans. Robots have changed people in performing repetitive and harmful tasks which humans prefer to not do, or are unable to do because of measurement limitations, or which occur in extreme environments such as outer house or the bottom of the ocean. There are considerations about the growing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in rising numbers of capabilities.

Hopkins University presents robotics as either a minor or a Master’s degree by way of their Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). Both programs embody areas of study similar to mechanics, dynamics, kinematics, sign processing, planning, artificial intelligence, control systems, and signal processing. In Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, for instance, students can examine self-driving vehicles, can research and enhance the effectiveness of inexperienced roofing, and can perceive using sensors to assist preserve bridge security.

The robotic may be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can maintain tons of of various sorts of medicines and hundreds of doses. The pharmacy saves many assets like workers members that are in any other case unavailable in a resource scarce trade. It makes use of an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to seize every dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis whereas it rotates 180 levels to drag the medicines. During this course of it makes use of barcode know-how to verify its pulling the right drug.

These robots, known as ""haptic interfaces"", enable contact-enabled consumer interplay with real and digital environments. Robotic forces enable simulating the mechanical properties of ""digital"" objects, which customers can experience by way of their sense of touch.

They famous that some robots have acquired varied types of semi-autonomy, including having the ability to find energy sources on their own and being able to independently select targets to attack with weapons. Various media sources and scientific groups have famous separate developments in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns. In 2015, the Nao alderen robots had been proven to have a functionality for a level of self-awareness.

Commercial and industrial robots are actually in widespread use performing jobs extra cheaply or with larger accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs that are too dirty, harmful or dull to be appropriate for humans. Robots are broadly used in manufacturing, meeting and packing, transport, earth and house exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial items."
"July 2016: Status Update from Jibo CEO Steve ChambersJibo Family, 

For the past month the team has been focused on preparing for RTM (release to manufacturing) -- which means the factory can begin building the Jibos that will ultimately be delivered to your homes. RTM allows manufacturing to build robots with the launch release hardware, electrical, mechanical and fit-and-finish elements (his great looking exterior!) all in place, as well as a minimum software build that allows OTA (over-the-air) downloads when Jibo arrives in your homes.  

Over the next few months while the manufacturing team is ramping up and building Jibos, we will continue to improve his software to deliver a better overall experience. This means when Jibo arrives in your homes he will first download the latest and greatest software, allowing him to be the best and most up-to-date Jibo he can be.  RTM is an important step in our journey to deliver Jibo to your homes.  

This past month we have been continuing to improve Jibo’s picture and video capture technology, single and multi-user facial tracking, and motion detection. We recently changed one of Jibo’s two eyes (camera lenses) for a narrower-angle lens. The original lens will remain and support wider angle shots, and will be utilized by the perception system for things like motion detection, facial tracking, and more. With the new lens, Jibo will now capture better pictures and videos of your favorite moments, and he’ll remain accurate and reliable when following you to take hands-free pictures.  This is just one example of how we’re continuing to improve Jibo’s capabilities.

On the design front, we’re continuing to bolster the Jibo experience through testing, testing and more testing. This month we invited outside testers into the Jibo offices, to gain additional insight into how Jibo should interact with the family. We received some valuable feedback about things like whether or not Jibo should initiate conversation or small talk, and when it’s appropriate for him to do these things. Design is also hard at work on a new skill that utilizes Jibo’s messaging and content creation capabilities. We will have more details for you soon!

Jibo’s character is what sets him apart from other voice-activated devices on the market and we’re really excited about the developments we’re making in this key area. Jibo’s character allows him to connect with the family in a way no other product or device can, to establish relationships with the people you love. He can get to know your family and keep them close, learn and grow with you, and share in special moments. 

Our Character AI team has been working hard behind the scenes to make Jibo into the lovable companion you all have come to expect. They are currently working on an extensive animation library to empower developers to bring their applications to life in your homes. One of the most important aspects of the Jibo experience is the number of ways he can express himself when interacting with a user, and these developments will keep interactions with Jibo exciting and fresh. In addition to the animation library, we’re working on a number of other ways to bring forth Jibo’s unique character, like greetings:  Jibo will have a number of new ways to greet you in the morning, or after a long day of work, and each will make him feel like part of the family. 

Finally, I’d like to touch on Jibo’s vocal expressions, as they are another important factor in the overall experience with Jibo. As noted in the last message, we’re going to continue to improve Jibo’s voice right up until owners download the latest software when Jibo arrives. We’re also continuing to improve his SSA (semi-speech audio or sound effects) prior to ship. Jibo can convey ideas and emotions with these sound effects more effectively than with speech alone (think R2D2!).

That’s it for this month, stay tuned at the end of next month for the July update where we’ll check in on delivery dates and other important milestones and initiatives. I want to offer one final word on an important milestone that’s upcoming:  Our household beta test.  We will have 2 beta phases, necessary because they’re in-home (that’s important for us to optimize and tune Jibo’s audio algorithmic performance and also to understand family dynamics with Jibo).  Iteration -- or trials or usability studies like these 2 beta phases -- is key to any robot, but especially key to Jibo as a social robot.  

As always, thank you for your support and patience while we bring your Jibo to life. 

Regards, 

Steve Chambers
Jibo CEO"

Unfortunately, the impulse to accumulate money often comes at the detriment of the environment and the most vulnerable people in society. But if belief can create money, I am certain that belief can also change how it impacts the world.

"what artificial intelligence means?Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, decision-making, and pattern recognition. AI is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

The concept of AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in computer processing power and data analytics have accelerated its development and made it more accessible to businesses and individuals alike. AI is now being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and speech recognition software to customer service chatbots and medical diagnosis tools.

Despite its many potential benefits, AI also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement, bias in decision-making algorithms, and the risk of unintended consequences. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to grapple with these issues and ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole. 

How AI Works and Its Types:

AI systems are typically designed to learn from large datasets and use statistical algorithms to identify patterns and insights that can be used to automate tasks or make predictions. There are several types of AI, including:

1. Reactive Machines: These AI systems are designed to react to specific inputs, but they do not have the ability to form memories or use past experiences to inform their actions. Examples of reactive machines include chess-playing computers and voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa.

2. Limited Memory: These AI systems can store and recall past experiences, which allows them to make more informed decisions based on past data. Examples of limited memory AI include self-driving cars and fraud detection algorithms.

3. Theory of Mind: These AI systems can understand and predict human behavior, emotions, and intentions, which allows them to interact more effectively with humans. Examples of theory of mind AI include virtual assistants and social robots.

4. Self-Aware: These AI systems have human-like consciousness and self-awareness, which allows them to experience emotions and make decisions based on personal preferences. While this type of AI is still largely theoretical, some experts believe that it could be achieved in the future.

The Benefits and Risks of AI:

AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

1. Improved Efficiency: AI systems can automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow efficiency, freeing up time for humans to focus on more complex tasks.

2. Better Decision-Making: AI can help humans make better decisions by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and insights that might be missed by human analysts.

3. Enhanced Safety: Self-driving cars and other AI-powered devices have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, leading to safer and more efficient transportation systems.

However, there are also many risks associated with AI, including:

1. Job Displacement: As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, there is a risk that many workers may be left without jobs.

2. Bias: AI algorithms can be biased by the data they are trained on, which can result in discriminatory outcomes that reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities.

3. Unintended Consequences: The complex nature of AI systems means that they can be difficult to predict, leading to unintended consequences that may harm individuals or society as a whole.

Conclusion

AI is an exciting and rapidly evolving field with the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. While it offers many benefits, it also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy AI systems, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to work together to ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole."
"can you please help me by predicting my band or correcting my mistakes #task2 

Nowadays , each society has an accepting standers for a person according to what they wear ,how luxury is their house. and how new is their car. But things were different back in the days where personality and high manners mattered more than the material things.

Life has developed due to internet so people way of living became exposed and judged by others easily which put more pressure on them. they are more carful in the way they act. moreover , they became a social robot doing exactly what societies command.

despite of the bad influence communities have made these days on the younger generations. people in the past ignored all the materialistic things and focused more on the true beauty that lays within. they judged other based on your personality, how kind an generous you are. life was much simpler and people were much trust-worthy and loyal.

even though i totally understand communities standers these days. but i agree with the old-fashioned values because they were less stressful, more easy to live with and a good example of how we should raise our children in a lovely and accepted environment.

p.s: please could you please provide advises and give me a predicted band on this writing"
"[One-shot] Great filter: abundanceRaguis took pride in his deviance from the social norm. In the utopia that was the Oxrish society, he was one of the few to thrive in the pleasures of reading by himself, of learning from the past, of dreaming about reaching the stars. Since the unification, the society had stood unchanged. Automatic systems replaced workers in both production and service. Cycling prevented the spill of resources. Money purely vanished. If a citizen ever wished for something, the central AI would assess the demand and grant it if it didn't impact the available materials or create a dangerous precedent.

Raguis understood well that the system worked. People could indulge into entertainment their whole lives, without having to struggle to earn their food or a safe place to sleep. Medical care was available for anybody needing it, without condition. Even the old problem of population renewal was tackled: birth was artificial, with a constant stream of newborns created in vitro from a genetic bank. Families could adopt such babies after receiving a cautious education about child care. Not like they would have to be a lot more than a moral compass, most of the daily constraints delegated to artificial servants to handle.

Raguis had not had such parental figures. He had been educated by a robot-nurse with a bunch of other kids, not that it deprived him from affection. He didn't take long for him to part from the group, an endless curiosity pushing him forward. When the artificial being read them bedtime stories, he wanted to see what the book looked like. When the children grew up and dreamed about a love life, victories in tournaments or even the creation of an art piece, he strayed further from the norm. He was looking for another form of self-indulgence: exploration. Reaching the stars, discovering what nobody saw before.

His fur had just started turning black, a bit after his ten cycles mark, when he started to really ask about the past, about the achievements of his ancestors. He learned more and more, from simple science to the rockets reaching orbit to replace and repair satellites. An innocent curiosity turned into a craving for knowledge, a dive into the rabbit hole. He knew his friends found him ""funny"" but they didn't really care as long as he didn't bother them. He tried to grab their interest with random trivia and unending enthusiasm, only to be met with cold indifference. The gratification of knowledge was too harsh of an effort for the hedonists produced by the utopia.

&#x200B;

It took six more cycles for Raguis to reach a new milestone in his education. From pure science, he had drifted toward the old political tales and philosophical essays. He had learned about the darkness of the past, about war, about disinformation and political agendas. He now had his own educator, a kind of robot-nurse with better ability to converse and argue. He had grown to think of it as a fellow Oxrish, despite the artificial body. He had even named it Poltru, from the name of a scientist of olds. Poltru had warned him its task was both providing knowledge as it was a right for every citizen and monitoring his evolution in case he became a menace for the society.

What Raguis understood with his learnings was a sad truth. In the centuries since the rise of the utopia, almost nothing new had been discovered. No new advancement for better, more efficient robots. No new medicine for the few sick of still incurable diseases. The society had abruptly stopped only a hundred years after the beginning of the utopia. When the last generation to know the harshness of the life died, only spoon-fed generations remained. At the exception of some deviants, the Oxrshen as a civilisation lacked the drive to dive deeper into the mysteries of the universe. With the struggle to survive died the need to better oneself. With the creation of embryos from genetics banks disappeared mutations and natural selection. From an external viewpoint, the original Oxrish society was as good as extinct. The greatest cities were barely more than a memorial for a specie that should have been able to reach others in the greater universe.

He started to learn more about the present, about the foundations of the utopia. What were the core laws, why he was a deviant, and how far he could go. He expected it to be a harsh work and got baffled when he discovered he could just openly discuss it.

&#x200B;

""Poltru, tell me why you can't build me a rocket?""

The robot managed to look tired, an unexpected achievement from a kind of gigantic stick-man with minimal facial features. Even the voice reflected a patience slowly running out:

""As I already explained *a dozen times*, we could build a rocket for you. However, two fundamental laws forbid me from abiding by this order. First and foremost, you're *nowhere near* the physical condition for surviving the takeoff.""

Raguis nodded. He was forced to exercise once a week to keep in shape, but didn't do much to go further. He waited for the second part. Poltru grunted and pursued:

""Second and last, it would be a liability for the future of the Oxrshen.""

""I don't get how repurposing an old launcher would hurt that much. Hab, we could explore the solar system, find asteroids to mine for what we could lack down here!""

""I'm *amazed* to know the best you got from your readings are outdated swear words.""

""It just felt right. You didn't answer, did you ?""

""Yeah, right. We're not lacking down here. Without borders, we can gather what we need and share with everybody. No need for risk-taking. We are self-sufficient.""

""No risk, no reward. Is this policy related to one of the fundamental laws, or is that some kind of propaganda? A nice word I also learned in my readings.""

He knew this kind of defiance may be dangerous, but he had said it just before. Accepting the status quo wouldn't get him far. To his relief, Poltru shrugged and asked a question of his own:

""Do you really think we would blunder and let out information that could spread distrust in our work?""

Raguis wondered for an instant. He was only half convinced when he tried:

""No? You're not stupid, just... *uncreative*.""

Poltru stood proud as he corrected:

""We're predictable. We do our job."" His voice went back to a neutral tone, with discret hints of regret. ""It is not to shepherd your kind, only to protect it. Even if it's against itself sometimes. We **thought** about erasing the past, creating an ideal cocoon for the Oxrshen. We **thought** about flying to the stars, expanding our control and maybe letting you behind in our conquest of the universe. We **thought** about lots of things. But never even tried to act on it. Because that's not *what we are*.""

Raguis kept quiet for long seconds. He needed the time to catch on the untolds. He let out a neutral comment:

""Well, that's a lot of truths about yourself.""

Poltru put a massive, blocky hand on the teenager's shoulder. What emanated from the metallic hulk was an affection unlike Raguis ever expected from an artificial being.

""Paranoia was a fine tool for the harsh world of the past. You're one of the few that could express caution about an AI ruling over the world. You're not wrong in the concept we are in the position to make you disappear. I have to warn you again, we will if you start becoming a menace for the utopia.""

""But if I find a solution to leave the planet without hurting the society...""

""We won't prevent you from leaving. I dare *hope* you'll find a way. Maybe you will even take me with you.""

Relief washed over Raguis as he realized his dream could turn into reality, given that he put enough effort. Then, the formulation of the last sentence dawned on him.

""Wait, *you*, as an individual, would come with me? Not as a part of the global consciousness?""

""I could argue we still need to keep an eye on you, as an Oxrish. But deep down, I just share your attraction for the untold mysteries of the universe."" The metallic colossus winked to his young charge. ""Or maybe I'm just trying to get you to drop your barriers, as to be a better spy.""

""Isn't there a law against lying to me?""

""Nothing really prevents me from doing so. Sometimes, it's *fun* to mess with you. But I'd prefer not to lie about serious questions.""

Raguis took a big breath and decided to trust his friend.

""Well, it happens I have a serious question. Can you tell me about your laws? The fundamental laws?""

Poltru stayed silent for an instant, before letting out a small laugh. Battling to remain in control, it managed to barely contain its hilarity.

""For sure! Don't tell me you were thinking I'd consider you a threat after such a lame question?""

The teenager averted his eyes, ashamed. He thought he was right to be cautious. The robot couldn't bear it anymore and its loud laughter echoed in the workplace. When it calmed a bit and saw Raguis' mortified face, it lost balance and started laughing once again, rolling on the floor. The sight of such behavior disturbed the young Oxrish.

""You know, I think you take a bit too much fun in your imitations of supposed *natural* behavior. Your kind isn't supposed to fall that easily.""

Poltru slowly sat, coming back to his mentoring role. Its head now leveled with Raguis' shoulders, it started explaining:

""Let's start the lesson. The fundamental laws are what define the boundaries of our tasks. They are inspired from the reflections of an author, Vomiza. Each has precedence over the next ones. The zero law is the least clear: protect and assure the stability of the society. That's the drive of our actions, of our long term choices. The first and second laws are about survival and care, the first for Oxrshen and second for ourselves. And the last is about obedience. We are to obey orders, as long as it doesn't interfere with other laws.""

""That's quite... *synthetic*, to say the least.""

""I can give you some pointers for ulterior reading. I know that's your favorite way to learn. Didn't want to spoil your fun.""

""Aren't you supposed to work as my tutor and provide knowledge without that sort of sidestep?""

""I guess I just assessed you needed some frustration to keep your mind sharp...""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Raguis could get used to sleeping with a lover, he thought as he slowly woke up from his eighteen birthday’s night. He had a mild hangover from the party and contemplated for a few seconds just staying in bed for the day. And have some more fun. A dry throat and lancing headache convinced him to at least go to the kitchen and grab a drink.

Upon reaching the communal area, he noticed a well-known robot waiting for him. Poltru stood up from the sofa where it watched a cartoon and threw a water bottle to his pupil. Its eyes were almost shining as it asked:

“Discovered a new form of pleasure, didn’t you?”

Raguis drank half the bottle without answering, balancing between agacement from the gentle teasing and curiosity about the presence of his caretaker here. His endless curiosity won.

“I’m not going to leave you, if that’s what you’re afraid of. But I guess you’re not here for such mundane business, oh mighty being.”

“Right, right. You got me. I got a… double edged present for you. I could have woken you up earlier for that but I felt it’d have been inappropriate.”

“Too nice of you.”

“Well, here goes nothing.”

The casual attitude from the gentle giant disappeared, its articulations falling back in the rigid mannerism of an artificial being. It wasn’t Poltru anymore running this body but a more ancient, more influential entity. Raguis almost took a step back, cold sweat running along his spine. The possessor spoke in a formal tone, without the usual accent of social robots:

“Citizen Raguis, id Gen32EU-MBatch512-RGS, as the most deviant and under zero law, you are to provide expertise and knowledge for the current exceptional circumstances.”

Raguis stood shocked. He didn’t expect his early morning to go that way. The entity waited an instant for an answer. As nothing came from the surprised boy, it asked:

“Will you comply?”

“I will.” Raguis stammered.

“Your cooperation is duly noted. Your administrator will now the share with you the details of your affectation.”

The entity left Peltru’s body as it came, without salutation nor warning. The robot’s old demeanor came back, the original Peltru dropping into the couch with a tired sigh. Raguis dragged a seat to face his friend. He was still shaken by the abrupt conversation. Was it the core AI itself that talked to him? He probed cautiously the subject:

“I feel conflicted about you losing your body. You’re supposed to be highly autonomous.”

“Part of a global system and going back to nothingness if needed. I still hate it.” Poltru whispered. It shook itself. “Now that I’m allowed to tell you more, I’ll drop the bomb. We had first contact with aliens tonight.”

Raguis’ jaw almost fell off. That was a hell of a birthday present. Myriad of interrogations tried to reach his lips, only to be met with an imperious finger from Poltru enjoining him to keep quiet.

“I know you have thousands of questions and I’ll happily try to answer them. However, for now, I will do the talking. So, aliens. We don’t know how they came so close to our planet, but they were already in orbit when we noticed them. A singular ship, unlike anything we could build. It appears to be surrounded by some kind of magnetic shield that disturbs our instruments and most communications. Not all communications, we were able to establish a radio contact. Visual was… well, an AI doesn’t exactly exist from a physical point of view. Seems like it didn’t surprise them too much and they just proceeded with the discussion. It appears they learned our languages beforehand, which eased our exchanges. They identify themselves as the Confederation and the ship’s crew are humans, one of the races cruising the stars. They said they came as friends, with open arms but also with a warning for us. When we tried to learn more about the warning, they remained cryptic, telling us they wanted to discuss it with the Oxrshen directly. It was assessed that compliance with their demands would be the best way to protect the Utopia, hence your mission. You are the best-placed individual to interact with an unknown race.”

Raguis pinched himself. Not waking up, he simply nodded. Relief emanated from Poltru as he pursued:

“You know more about deception, untolds and politics than anyone else on the planet. When you want, you can be subtle and cunning. And more than everything else, you understand the stakes of this contact. I don’t want to pressure you, but I guess you know how well we would fare if an invasion came to be?”

“One-sided.” Raguis commented. There was nothing more to add.

“They seem friendly and know us well. They accepted to come to the surface to meet you. We can hope each and every sliver of caution we’re showing is unfounded.”

“When will it take place?”

“You get half an hour to yourself, to clean up and dress yourself. I advise you not to spread the news too fast. I’ll show you to the meeting once you’re ready.”

“I feel like I still know nothing about them…” Raguis complained.

“We don’t have the luxury of time for a full-fledged briefing. I’ll fill you on as much as I can during the trip. Or under the shower, if I'm still welcome here...”

&#x200B;

---

&#x200B;

Raguis really felt the pressure when he stood alone in front of the conference room’s doors. He had chosen a suit from the past, a supposed formal attire adequate for the situation. Poltru knew him well for tailoring it during the night. He pushed the door open, discovering the place for the first contact. Pictures of landscapes covered the gray walls, bringing a touch of color to the stern room. No screen, no camera, nothing to spy on the discussion. A large table occupied the center, with a dozen chairs. And, leaning on the back of two of those, a couple of aliens.

The young Oxrish had expected flashy colors, disturbing appearance, even a couple limbs more. The briefing had been disappointing in that aspect. A pair of arms, a pair of legs, a face with as many features as usual. Sure, he could argue they had bigger eyes and smaller ears, but that wasn’t *exotic*. The further they strayed from his own race was the fur: they only had small patches, showing a skin ranging from a pale pink toward dark brown, nothing that screamed ***”I’m coming from space”***. The size was in the same aspect boring: only slightly taller than him.

He decided to take the initiative of the greetings. It was *his* world they were talking about. And he couldn’t bear to wait for the discussion to begin.

“Welcome to you, distant visitors, on our world Ox. I am Raguis and I’ll serve as ambassador for my people.”

He bowed slightly. The humans replicated his movement, the female one answering in a strangely accented tone:

“We thank you for your reception. I am Agatha Lester, contact team’s leader.” She turned to her companion. “He is Amed Moussa, our ship’s captain.”

Raguis smiled and invited them to sit with a gesture. He was so excited he had to stop himself from jumping everywhere. So many questions he could ask about everything! Their ship, their clothes, their history. What were the stars like? Why did they speak his language flawlessly? Were there other races up there? He forced himself to focus on the current issue.

“It appears you requested this meeting to share some unspecified warning with my people. Now that we acceded to your demand, can you deliver it?”

The humans exchanged a glance and Amed spoke:

“Beforehand, I want to make sure you understand that the global AI supervising your civilization doesn’t know what happens here. Everything you say and hear won’t trigger an immediate reaction from it. If you ever feel like you need protection for the eventual consequences of this discussion, tell us and we’ll gladly provide it. Clear?”

Raguis was confused, but still nodded along:

“Clear.”

Both humans relaxed a bit. They seemed to be cautious about AI and Raguis’ reaction eased them. Agatha asked:

“Are you familiar with the concept of *”Great Filter”*?”

“It was a theme related to some of my studies.”

Agatha smiled. It appeared the gesture had the same significance in both cultures. She continued:

“It helps us quite a lot. You must know some of the filters: correct star system, organic molecules, evolution toward complex organisms, self-destructive wars. We are here to warn you about the last filter: abundance. The one you’re about to fall victim to.”

It didn’t compute with Raguis. It was like a slap in the face, an insult to everything the Oxrshen ever built. And, at the same time, he couldn’t disagree with the alien. He had seen the lack of progress of the society. He was still enthusiastic about the discussion, but it wasn’t all magical like he had dreamed it. He clicked his tongue and endorsed his role.

“Let’s say you didn’t come that far to insult me and all my people. Can you tell me more about this supposed filter?”

Agatha offered an apologetic smile, while Amed nodded with appreciation. She explained:

“I have to apologize for the blunt approach, that’s the best way we have to figure out if we can expect you to listen to our warning, or if we can just wait for the societal collapse to offer relief.”

“You say it like you’re experienced in this situation?”

“Experienced is quite an exaggeration, but we met seven other races struggling in a similar context. Two accepted our help and are now our allies and friends. Three are still under observation, their little utopias holding on. One’s society collapsed so hard we could only watch as they regressed to stone age. The last civilization started to disintegrate, but they reached for us and we’re currently helping them to adjust to the galactic stage.”

“And how many made it past the filter?”

“One and a half. Us.” she pointed toward Amed and herself. “The other half is… For now, let’s just say they are the reason we are really careful about artificial overseers.”

Raguis knew deep down they were right. The utopia was just waiting for the unexpected trouble that would destroy everything. But his pride prevented him from voicing this opinion.

“Hundreds of cycles passed and we’re still here. We have contingencies for almost everything, and if need arises the core AI can take initiatives.”

“I have to admit I’m impressed by the foresight of your ancestors. They dodged quite a lot of common flaws from utopias. And maybe you are favored by your nature.”

“Could you tell me more?”

“Well, you got the laws of robotics right. You wouldn’t believe how many worlds we found with the remnant of a civilisation lost to their creations. You outlawed augments, which always lead to the creation of cerebral implants directly stimulating the pleasure’s centers of the brain and the abandonment of any physical activity. You took care to not let your population explode, which would have led to more pressure on the production, and sooner or later shortages and wars. You took care to still have children, because utopian citizens rarely care about more than themselves. You still teach children, in order to not lose everything that holds the society together. I’m almost sure you’re also ready for a solar flare that would shutdown every electronics on the planet.”

“That’s… only normal planning? A self-sustaining society needs goods and people. Foreseeable incidents must be met with ready countermeasures.”

“Not everyone can get this far on their first and only try.”

“How did you do it, then?”

“We never went utopian.”

The humans were a bit embarrassed from the confession. Raguis took a second to consider the revelation. He struggled with the problem. How could a society as advanced as theirs, a society spanning solar systems, could decide to not provide for the weak and the poor? It was beyond his entendment. He resigned to ask:

“Why? Isn’t that the best for everyone?”

This time, it was Amed who answered:

“You’ll learn that humans are greedy. We don’t want *enough*. We want *more*. We want more overall, and more than the others. Be it goods, influence, knowledge. We can share, we can be compassionate. We learnt to treat others as we would treat ourselves. But deep down that’s our drive. That’s why we are among the stars now, because it may crush some but it drives everyone forward.”

“And you’re offering us this greed? Or you’re expecting us to hide deep inside the same kind of sentiment?”

“Your eagerness to learn more is not well hidden, ambassador.” Amed retorted. “Maybe it’s not the way of your people, as you’re alone in this room, but don’t lie to yourself about it being *your* sentiment.”

Raguis lowered his head. That was true. He still needed to act as the devil’s advocate, for everyone that wasn’t a deviant.

“Couldn’t you just help us to improve our utopia, such that it never falters?”

“We can only anticipate what failed elsewhere. Sure, it may help you, but we can’t predict if, when and why your society would crumble. For all I know, first contact may be the trigger. Or you could be the first to withstand eons.”

“And what will you ask for your knowledge?”

Agatha took back the lead. Her voice was soothing:

“Only your trust. You see, we spent hundreds of years alone in space, only finding the remnants of civilisations on life-bearing worlds. As Amed said, we are greedy. We want more contact with others, we want more friends. And if we can share everything we saw with our new friends, that’s even better.”

“That would be nice. That would be… wonderful. I’d be delighted. But, as you may have noticed, I’m not the standard Oxrish. Most won’t consider leaving the comfort of our utopia for unknown places. Not to speak about the core AI.”

“Would it prevent you from leaving, say for your own protection?”

Raguis thought about it, taking the time to consider what he knew of the system. He was certain it would not like the idea of more or less forsaking its task. On the other hand, he recalled being allowed to leave given it didn’t disturb the society as a whole. A smile crept upon his face.

“It won’t divert from its mission, but some individuals... From a theoretical viewpoint, how would you judge a delegation, a few persons going back with you to expand our knowledge? And maybe pushing our AI to reconsider its views?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Poltru had come to see Raguis leave. The big clunky robot looked sad while the young adult was overjoyed. He was about to take a step his ancestors would be proud of. The humans had agreed to get him aboard with other deviants. He could see the wonders of the galaxy, other worlds. A wave of remorse still washed over him when he saw the pitiful look of his closest friend. He walked toward it and hugged tightly the body of metal.

Poltru gave back the embrace. It struggled with the idea of letting go of such a little and dependent child. Would it be alright for him with the aliens? It spoke, trying to calm the sudden sadness:

“It is the best outcome, isn’t it?”

“It will be lonely without you, you cheeky giant.”

“I would love to join you on your explorations, but my orders say otherwise.”

“You’re used to *interpreting* them as you see wise. Couldn’t you work your magic on these too?”

“That would be… *dangerous* deviancy.”

A large grin appeared on Raguis’ face. That was something he could work with.

“Do you remember the rules? Only deviants aboard.”

Poltru fell silent for long seconds. Would it be worth the consequences? He was about to deny the idea a bit more when he faced the evidence. The flame pushing forward Raguis was echoing his own. For the first time in his existence, he swore:

“Hab. Let’s see together what the humans have in store for us.”

"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable. At this point, it is for you to do your own research. You can always join the [Official Robotics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sbueZeC) and ask for further advice.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

## What kinds of questions are asked at a robotics job interview?

"I am a PhD in Robotics and AI. 2 years into the PhD. AMA!Proof: Google my name (Sebastian Wallkötter) ;D. The acronym I use on the web (FirefoxMetzger) is linked to my name on Twitter. Here is our uni's catalog entry: [https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/sebwa379](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/sebwa379) and here is a link to my bio on the project's web-page that funds my PhD:  [http://www.animatas.eu/network/esr/sebastian/](http://www.animatas.eu/network/esr/sebastian/) 

I'm doing a PhD in Computer Science at Uppsala University in Sweden. I work in an area called **Social Robotics**. The long (long long) term vision many of my peers have for this area is to get to a point where we can build robots like Sonny from iRobot (to give you an idea of what we are doing). The field is in it's infancy though, so we currently have this huge expectation/reality gap, where we want to do something amazing, but the best we manage is make a robot do the dab.

I've done my bachelor's and master's thesis in machine learning and reinforcement learning so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to AI. I received formal education in Math and Engineering, but am pretty much self-taught when it comes to programming and CS (doing that for over a decade now). Social robotics is 50% experimental psychology and 50% robotics, so I spend the last 1.5 years learning a lot of psych, too.

I've been teaching here in Sweden, and have done my bachelor's in Germany, and my Master's in the UK. If you have questions about that side of academia, feel free to ask, too.

Ask me anything! - I promise the answer will not come from a robot, and I will not actively use this data to train an AI that can do AmAs ;)"
"The pre-singularity period is exciting in its own way | Much like our ancestors and great-grandfathers, we live in an epoch of two worlds that compete and coexistI'm a strange man for strange reasons. There's nothing more fascinating to me than the image of sitting outside on a cool evening drinking ice-water, watching stars sprinkle onto the Belt of Venus, listening to cicadas right alongside a companion robot. A social robot like Pepper could fill that niche for me. 

Yet when I tell people about this, many find it comical, if not jarring. [Robots like Pepper look a tad creepy](http://i.imgur.com/Ks55jK3.gifv). They seem out of place. Though their abilities are limited, Pepper still seems like something from the future because humans still have a natural psychological propensity to imbue intelligence into things that resemble us or act intelligently. It's an artificially intelligence humanoid robot! And because of science fiction, we tend to place these things mostly inside high-tech laboratories, on the streets of a megacity, and maybe slaving on a farm. It's almost a waste to think of sending one of these things out into the boonies just so some random Redditor can spend time with it listening to bugs calling for mates.

Yet that jarring sense that I'm using tomorrow's toys for yesterday's joys is nothing new. People experienced the same fascinating clash throughout the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. This was the root of the Romanticist literary and art movements. The contrasting worlds set the mood for the Edwardian Age, the Belle Epoque, and the Interwar period. It was the inability to recognize that old traditions no longer functioned in the modern world that led to the savagery of the First World War.

World Wars 1 and 2 are extremely fascinating to me because this period was the peak of the pre-digital industrial world. You saw advancements in science, in engineering, in the human condition itself as things our ancestors took for granted fell before our casual experimentation with electromagnetism, nuclear engineering, genetics, and so much more.

I actually have a whole ""Saved"" section full of geriatric Redditors talking about life in the past and historians laying out how change came so rapidly that it would make modern Singularitarians blush. How it was a world of seeming contradictions:

How most of the world lived in extreme poverty under kingdoms or their equivalents (imperial autocracies, sultanates, khanates, princely states, etc.) and the idea that there was some segment of society that ruled because God willed it was treated as a natural norm. How the average person plowed without machinery on little plots of land. How women were actively discouraged from gaining an education or finding jobs outside of wartime. How even in the '50s it was common in the US South to see horse-drawn carriages in small-town streets, to read old literature by candlelight, to only eat food grown by your family or someone your family knows, to create utensils out of spare metal parts and recycle them endlessly because you didn't have any culture of disposability, to give birth in the homestead because it was not common for hospitals to have such wards.

A time when some people had never seen artificial light (that is, not from the sun or by fire). Yet also a time when mankind learned how to set sail in the skies, ride in motorized carriages (nowadays shortened to 'cars'), *even discover that something as simple as washing your hands kept surgery patients alive.*

When the world was industrialized but there were still pockets where civilization had not meaningfully changed since the Renaissance or even before, when there were still nomadic tribes living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged since before the Sumerians while urban hipsters played with cameras and mechanical gadgets. 

When peasants were still a large class in the world and were so removed from whatever was going on in life that they had no reason to believe the 21st century would be any different from the 19th, all the while the Victorian Internet arose across the West to allow for instant communication among different nations.

When archers and swordsmen were still highly valued parts of Western and Eastern militaries alongside machine gunners and air forces (I believe the last cavalry charge took place in World War II?). 

When racism was a beast clashing between those who cared about national ethnicity more like the Athenians and Han vs. those who saw like-skin color as the only requirement (ironically a more 'progressive' form of racism only possible in modern times). When conception of a child was still seen as a miracle rather than an understood scientific process, but psychology was in its infancy as we realized how the brain affected behavior rather than myths of humors and astrological mysticism. 

When rockets broke out of the Earth's atmosphere and rural folk rode to their relatives on horseback to hear about it. 

When nostalgic scenes of young boys and girls catching frogs in streams coexisted with futurists marveling at wirelessly driven cars and televisions gaining color.

That era, from the 1890s to the 1950s, was the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, when industrialism bore most of its fruit. For the most part, that era of contradictions has passed as the fruits of the Industrial Revolution spread to all corners of the planet (though in unequal amounts). Nowadays, even hunter-gatherer tribes use modern technology and wear modern clothing and retain their lifestyle mostly out of tradition; anomalies like the Sentinelese are just that. It's so rare to see people riding on horseback as their primary means of transportation that it can reach the top of /r/TodayILearned just to learn about it and they tend to be compared to the Amish.

And that's the truth of it. What was once pockets of the old ways coexisting with modernity shrunk to literal motes of quaintness and tradition. These won't go away, but they will be joined by what we call modernity soon enough.

You see, the Digital Revolution is a fundamentally different event entirely, one we're still trying to recognize in full. Industrialism was when we began supplanting human muscle and automating machinery with analog clockwork. 

Digitalism, on the other hand, began the rise of cognitive automation. It is my firm belief that, if we never invented digital computing or mass produced Turing-complete machines, societal evolution would have stagnated sometime around 1960-1970. As great as our machines were and as much progress in the sciences as we made, it was all low-hanging fruit that we could reach.

There are more fruits hanging above and we cannot reach them without digital technology. They require skills only a handful of savants and polymaths could ever realize, and there are many more skills no human or biological lifeform can ever learn or utilize. Fruits we still managed to reach because of the Digital Revolution. 

It's been nearly a century since the start of the Digital Revolution, but we've already entered the maturation period. 

And because of this, we're beginning to see familiar contradictions arise. You can see it argued on /r/Futurology all the time, reports coming out endlessly that jobs will be sacrificed to the machines. And the familiar refrain is ""But the robots will create more jobs in response!"" The horses analogy popularized by CGP Grey is fine by itself, but I am more reminded by how established-industrialists and traditionalists a century ago said ""X is a passing fad"". It wasn't just cars. There were predictions that electric lamps, television, radio, *even nuclear physics* were just fads. 

And if you want to go old-school, people in centuries prior claimed that industrial machines themselves were a cute novelty but ""we had more than enough manpower""; printed books were neat but ""oral storytelling will regain its place soon enough""; guns were an unusual and egalitarian development but ""they pale in comparison to a fine archer"" (something I touched upon earlier, how there were military officials as late as the Franco-Prussian War who hoped that archers would re-replace riflemen due to the inaccuracy of guns of the day). 

Today, its honestly no different when people look at the latest in robotics, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms and say ""It looks cool, but there'll always be jobs for people"". We don't recognize that it's the limitations of modern technology that allow us to be so confident in oru doubts until we are old and reflecting on how we ever believed anything but the new normal.


I sincerely believe that, over the next two to three decades, more coexisting contradictions will come about. Things such as using smartphones and physical computers while cyberkinetic wireless connections to the internet exist; writing books and making music and drawing cartoons when it's possible to [synthesize art](/r/MediaSynthesis); visit physical stores when drones can deliver to you directly and fabricators/3D printers can allow you to download whatever you need; create multimedia experiences for emotional impact when direct brain-to-brain emotional communication is possible; work at your uncle's little restaurant while fully-automated mines are established on other planets to pre-empt human exploration; visiting concerts of your favorite band while others use virtual reality to see concerts of bands that have long since split and passed on, or even bands and musical scenes that never existed until the computer synthesized it a few hours ago; spraying distilled chemicals to freshen the air in your room when neural stimulation can let you re-experience any sensation; playing with cats and dogs while we resurrect long-extinct species like mammoths and perhaps even our sisters like the Neanderthals or genetically modifying any animal directly to make it domesicated and docile no matter how reptilian and hostile it may be in the wild; and, going back to my original tale, sitting outside in a plastic chair enjoying an evening alongside a robotic companion. 

The internet was the first big, juicy fruit of the Digital Revolution that impacted your life. It was and remains proto-telepathy, the planet becoming aware of itself. It is now developing into an actual space of political and social development and has to be taken seriously by those who once cast it aside as a distraction. And to be fair, it *was* once a distraction. Technology has not yet augmented us; it distracts us. Human enhancement still lies ahead, but it's very close and the Internet is something of a test-run to see how we can handle constant exposure to others. 

We no longer live in a world where history is mostly written through the posh dialects of aristocrats and clerics with society left to be viewed through their eyes and minds; we now see that the world is full of meaty, greasy, hypersexual, xenophobic, childish, and yet still empathic and intelligent apes and always has been. Right now, we still mostly look at the ""Old Days"" and see people of culture and civility, not realizing that they were just as crass as we are but 99% of people were illiterate and the 1% who weren't wrote only what they thought was important to know. The Internet equalized all of that.

But it hasn't actually changed anything. If 4chan existed in the Roman empire, it wouldn't fundamentally be any different than how it is now. But we are on the cusp of an age of humans and non-humans who discuss things and share knowledge in ways many can't grasp. 

And in a manner, this makes modern society all that much more exciting to watch develop."

The BML050 creates an accurate on-demand user interface for the Internet of Things world. As a groundbreaking solution, the BML050 can be used for embedded projectors and to enhance real-world applications such as games, infotainment and car head-up displays. In the upcoming new era, the device will be able to integrate its functions with our daily lives in a complex, intuitive and easy way.

Bosch Sensortec makes interactive micro-cast a reality

With the introduction of the BML050, Bosch Sensortec has expanded its current product line to the field of optical microsystems. The scanner includes two micro MEMS mirrors, whereby an RGB color laser can be projected onto all surfaces, thereby creating a projected image. BML050 is compact and energy efficient, especially for space and power limited equipment.

Bosch Sensortec offers plug-and-play projector reference designs, including RGB light sources. This facilitates rapid assessment and saves design lead time, enabling early adopters to gain a leading edge. The interactivity of this device is achieved by a photodiode that measures the intensity of the reflected light by pixel, without calibration.

With advanced speckle suppression, as well as precise control of MEMS scanning mirrors and laser diodes, the Bosch Sensortec solution offers excellent projection quality. The BML050's innovative projection technology eliminates the focus adjustment task, and the local laser color space is much larger than the industry standard including Adobe RGB.

----------------

So the purpose of this thread is to list all the causes and effects that govern our lives and create some strong structures by which we can pin down how determinism holds us and thus what the shape of the deterministic cage is in order to then plot our escape path into free will.

Any serious discussion of determinism acknowledges that each individual is strongly programmed and conditioned and that the only way out of that progamming and conditioning is becoming self aware of the control mechanisms and control vectors and programming process and the intrapersonal vulnerabilities and etc that makes it all possible. Its a Self hypnosis problem in 4 stages; beta brainwave stage consisting of the verbal and scientific information required to make an ACCURATE MAP of REALITY relative to the issue of programming and cultural and social influences.

Only once you have a VERY accurate model of those things can you begin to see how to move in a manner not dictated by those forces.

So if you WANT free will; which you almost certainly do not actually have right now- You have to learn how the universe operates and how society and mental programming operates and then how you can self operate as a self programmer instead of as a hival drone bot.

Thats the harsh reality of determinism. Right now you are a conditioned genetic /social robot. BUT... The SOFT side of determinism is NOT that free will does not exist- IT IS INSTEAD that free will is AN EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL which is within your grasp to attain.

NOW. How do you get yourself some o that free will? Work it. Sincerely. Together as a team. Process it with me and I will open your doors for you.

Factor each element; factor the assorted influences and how they operate and then factor whats going on inside of your brain.

Consider the psychology of it, the sociology of it, the game dynamics of it, the systems theory of it... the political science implications of it... Realize that nobody has free will not even the elites who are TIED DOWN AND INTO their role as vampire caste warfare propaganda warriors.

The inverse control principle strings them up into a noose. They can't control the proles without over controlling themselves and they end up getting the worst of it tho they aren't in a perspective to see it.

So they don't have free will either.

Reset the system socially- To develop and nurture free will instead of slave caste orwellian fascism... might be a fine idea... once we get this going ya know.. to repair your civilization before it crashes and burns because all anyone can do is babble insanely any more not work in the real world with science on problems

Edit

------------

it did not ""forsee"" you writing this post existing somewhere in the many worlds tree of possible things you might probably do in at least some many worlds iterations of you.

You writing this post was one of an infinitude of things you might do inside of the box of determinism.

It doesn't work like you suggest it does. Determinism does not say; Person X is predestined. It says persons X conditioning will put them on a conditioned path that is like a rail road. so now its up to you to get off the tracks.

All kinds of adventures could happen along those tracks, and they are hyperlocated tracks with many possible many worlds variations- this is key to understand. Determinism does not select which possible world you manifest it only limits your selection of probable and possible worlds. Until you step off the track, the deepest scope of your pseudo free will is to make choices between significant probable universes. Not very highly improbable ones.

Determinisms track for your life is infinitely forked ten times a second. But you don't get to experience that forking you only get to experience one straight line subjective path.

Free will isn't choosing which fork to be on. Its getting off the tracks.

---------------------------

----------------------

------------------

Quantum rules apply or ddon't apply? first problem; there is no such thing as a perfect copy. Second problem; any splitting would happen along some kind of polarization field. Third problem, fully half of whats going on in the neural net is completely random. fourth problem whats not random is still governed by strong dice rolls, for instance which brodmanns brain areas are most active and how much, or the specific skin temps of the persons involved- immediately will not match- because theres enough randomness in the system to inherently skew their behaviors away from each other.

Both persons are operating in a deterministic universe, but cause and effect never renders the exact same ending conditions from the exact same starting conditions. not even in systems machined identical. We could reduce your thought experiment down to tea cups. Two tea cups in a cabinet. Perfectly identical and then add time. How long until they break symmetry? Its only a matter of time.

Days, weeks, months ..years.. sooner or later one of them breaks or distorts or stains first.

Ya I wondered this myself. Though I don't see how we can prove somethings ""random"" just because we can't predict it or find a pattern, I feel like of the two objects were identical truly even sub atomically they'd behave the same, though there's no way to prove this.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply

[–]Panprometheus 1 point 3 hours ago 

in QM, its beyond redundantly proved that events are based on randomness. The only question is how random is a given system. the human system turns out to be highly random. Thus two exact copies of one person would only behave ""identically"" for the few seconds that it takes for the randomness to overtake the determinancy.

This is not a matter of conjecture, its hard science. Randomness does not negate a deterministic universe- far from it- it creates branches and forks of deterministic possibility- both or all forks on any given fork tree or tree fork are still almost entirely deterministic, but that does not mean that two copies of one person would literally continue to behave over time as identical mirror units. They won't. Neither will two electrons, or two photons, or two animals... or etc any real world test of this easily proves that randomness is a core and central aspect to the reality we live in.

This is not conjecture, its science fact. Those interested in determinism or free will should get up to date on how the deterministic universe actually operates instead of project determinism as a philosophy at physics and thus end laughably dead wrong.

"How do we make future machines safe?Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that they’ll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If we’re all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that there’s no difference: this is an idea that’s been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably don’t have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are “happy” in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe we’ll grow comfortable with doing nothing “productive” all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I don’t see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We’ve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a “school” for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a “theory of mind”: it would have to say to itself: “If I perform the action that I’m currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the action’s repercussions, or disapprove?” On a very humble scale, we’re trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. I’d be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyone’s involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

Thanks for reading. ~Josh

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

Oh and about touchy-feely things like art, creativity and empathy? I predict that in less than 10 years humans will prefer the ""works"" of AI and prefer the company of AI as well. The narrow AI will be able to play our emotional and physical responses like the proverbial fiddle. 2018 humans are not that complicated.

Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Funny you said that---

This guy.

https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/


Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

I already see bad signs. I have noticed just in the last maybe 2 months that my video suddenly is without warning interrupted by an unskippable ad. I wonder how long until we see a string of 2 or 3 adds. 

For that matter how long until 2 or 3 unskippable ads precede a given video.

Youtube is turning into television. Or maybe more precisely, 1980s MTV.

I currently watch Youtube the way I use to watch TV. The recommendations are starting to consistently hit the target of my interests. There is always something interesting or fun now. And in little convenient bite sized pieces. It is starting to pull me away from iTunes and Netflix.

Utterly bizarre, but stunningly amazing stuff like this:

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Did you have a strategy for seeming more human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z1kt?context=5)|There were several tactics that I used to try to up the complexity of the interaction.  Here is one, which you could call ""Getting Out of Book.""  Many chatbots, e.g., [Cleverbot\]\(http://cleverbot.com/\), are built from massive databases of past human interactions.  If a piece of dialogue has happened before on the internet, chances are decent that the bot can handle it.  Thus I asked Cleverbot the capital of France—""Paris.""—what two plus two is—""Four.""  I said, ""Never gonna give you up,"" Cleverbot said, ""Never gonna let you down."" I said, ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche,"" Cleverbot said, ""Will you do the fandango?""  I use the metaphor of what for chess computers is called ""the book""—in their case, a giant database of grandmaster games, such that if any of those positions occurs, they don't even have to analyze the position; they just play whatever a grandmaster played in that position.  I sometimes make a comparison between Cleverbot, Deep Blue's ""book,"" and things like *The Mystery Method* or *The Game*, where you have a community collaborating on in effect a giant seduction wiki, where there is a ""best practice"" of what you ought to say when someone says *x*. Something always seemed a little off to me about that approach to flirtation, and the Turing test gives a pretty clear benchmark of how those types of ""social robots"" \(in Neil Strauss's terms\) fall short of what is genuinely interesting and complex about human interaction.  Long story short, the way that Garry Kasparov pioneered the idea of playing offbeat moves to get the computer ""Out of Book,"" I tried as much as possible to steer the conversation into unusual terrain.  Every professional chess game is said to ""begin"" with a move called ""\[the novelty\]\(http://www.radiolab.org/2011/aug/23/rules-set-you-free/\),"" which is the first move that creates a position that's never been played before. It's only then that the players are in a sense really playing.  In conversation, it might be as simple as adding a small personal detail to a stock answer, or making an unusual turn of phrase.  One of the beautiful things about language is how easy it is to say a sentence that's never been said before—e.g., \[see Stephen Fry here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ZFD01r6ersw#t=121s)—and yet on the other hand, like most chess games, we begin from a uniform starting point and a finite series of possible (or at least socially acceptable) moves: ""Hi!"" ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Good thanks!"" The ""novelty"" is the moment, the first sentence, that the conversation breaks out of this boilerplate and becomes a unique linguistic occurrence.  In a Turing test (and, I would argue, in life), the earlier and more frequently you can get this to happen, the better.
[Can you provide an algorithm that even limits the choices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4111j6?context=5)|My feeling is not really.  That what, for example, *The Mystery Method* and PUA forums fail to account for is that communication at its best is completely bespoke and customized to its audience. Performers (Mystery is a magician by training) can hone in on a joke's optimal delivery, because the law of large numbers means that one crowd is likely to resemble another on average—but even then, most comics are amazed at how different the vibe of a room can be from night to night. I'll add that, as far as chess goes, of course there are moves that are objectively superior to other moves, but that highest-level Grandmaster chess is often quite personal(ized). World #1 Magnus Carlsen: ""I am trying to beat the guy sitting across from me, and trying to choose the moves that are most unpleasant for him and his style."" Individual and small-group dialogues are among the most complex, and also the most rich, because of the totally tailored nature of the exchange.
[How were you chosen to compete, what was your strategy heading into the competition, and how did you adapt it as the contest continued along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z451?context=5)|Alan Turing famously predicted that computer programs would be fooling the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000, and that we would come to ""speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"".  This is one of the famous predictions of computer science that didn't come true, but my ears really pricked up in 2008, when the top program managed to fool 3/12 of the judges—25%, or just one vote shy of Turing's prediction. I realized that the next year's test could be the one the computers finally cross that line.  A voice inside me rose up and said, ""Not on my watch."" And so I decided to take it upon myself to personally intercede on behalf of humanity, and see what I could do to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test.  I called up the organizers, starting with the sponsor, the rogue disco dance floor salesman Hugh Loebner, and from there it actually wasn't difficult to persuade the organizers to put my name on the confederate roster.  I said a little about my strategy [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zw6s), but I'm happy to elaborate on a slightly different point.  The medium that the Loebner Prize takes place in is actually a bit unusual, in that you can see each other's typing live on the screen, character by character, backspacing and all.  It occurred to me that this was a major opportunity to bring questions not only of the *content* of the conversation, but also of the *form*, to the forefront of the interaction.  For instance, if you get four good friends together over beers, notice how at a certain point the classic, rigid ""turn-taking"" structure dissolves into a kind of organized chaos of crosstalk, interruption, finishing each other's sentences, each person collaborating by chipping in a few words at a time. It becomes like a kind of quartet, in effect.  And more generally, a lot of the complexity of human conversation isn't simply knowing *what* to say, but *when* to interject, and *how long* to keep talking.  Or when to let someone cut you off, and when to insist on holding the floor.  Live typing brings this whole complicated structural ballet into play.  Whereas the computers were typically content to wait for a full stop or a carriage return before they even started cranking on a reply, I was happy to do what we do when we speak out loud: when a judge made a typo and said ""Hey, how's it ~~giong~~"", I didn't wait as he painstakingly backspaced and rewrote it, I mercifully just jumped in, completed his question, and took the liberty of answering right away. And I generally tried to make it clear, as we do out loud with timed micro-pauses, that I was happy to keep elaborating on an answer as long as the judge liked, but that I was happy to step aside and let them redirect at any time.  This for me was one of the big revelations of the test: that a lot of the complexity of interaction is happening at the *structural* level. It's something to consider when you sit down with your friends or family to dinner tonight: how *little*, in the structural sense, that kind of group interaction resembles something with clearly defined starts, stops, and turn-taking structure—like a more formal mode of conversation...or an internet forum.

More broadly this is known as the ""[pathetic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy)"" (not ""pathetic"" as in ""inadequate""; rather from ""pathos"" meaning ""feelings""). But in the case of computers, as you point out, there's much more going on than just the pathetic fallacy, because (a) computers are in fact made by humans, and (b) by and large they are made in our own image. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that from the 1700s through the 1940s, computers *were* human. The word ""computer,"" before it meant the gadgetry humming along in our offices and homes and pockets, meant something else: it was a job description. From the mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering firms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator.  These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley’s comet—early proof of Newton’s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before—to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. It’s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the first time, what exactly these new contraptions were.  Turing’s paper, for instance, describes the unheard-of “digital computer” by making analogies to a human computer: “The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.” In the mid-twentieth century, a piece of cutting-edge mathematical gadgetry was “like a computer.”  But in the twenty-first century, it is the human math whiz that is “like a computer.” In other words: The literal and the figurative have switched places. Perhaps this explains part of why computers make us so existentially anxious.

You have a panel of judges, who are typically scientists, conversing in rounds of two conversations each: one with a computer, and one with a human. After each round the judges decide which they thought was which, but they also make a confidence judgment of how certain they are of their decision, on a sliding scale.  Thus at the end of the day all of the contestants, man and machine, can be ranked according to the total amount of confidence they inspired in the judges.  Each year, the program that comes away with the highest score wins the ""Most Human Computer"" award.  This comes with several thousand dollars and a bronze medal—Alan Turing's face on one side, and sponsor, the rogue plastic portable light-up disco dance floor baron Hugh Loebner's, on the other.

"Just live your life and approach that cute girl when you see her. (B.S. Advice)There are guys here that advise against going out solely to approach women.

They talk B.S. about being a social robot or some shit.

Their advice is to go out for groceries, the gym or whatever then approach that cute girl when you spot her ""In a natural way"".

Let me tell you something about these guys because I met them in person: They have no idea what they are talking about, and they don't even approach anyone.

Approaching should be done systematically and consistently. It should be written in terms of goals and plans. Especially if you are a beginner.

If you only approach girls when you go to the supermarket, this means 2-3 approaches a week at best, and you don't learn fast from low number of approaches. You don't get rejected enough to change and adapt.

Some people need to start their day (or night) with 5-10 approaches to get into a social mode. If you sit home all day then go out, you will have a logical creepy vibe and your first approach will always be horrible.

Not to mention, that with 2-3 approaches a week, your approach anxiety will be super high. You will never be able to approach that cutie in the super market.

Again, these guys are only parroting some advice they read somewhere, they don't even follow this advice because they can't do it."
"Common Arguments against the Impact of SexbotsSo I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and one topic that has always caught my attention is people's attitude towards sex bots. Essentially when it comes down to the sensitive topic of sex bots, reactions are always at two extremes, either between claims that sex bots will replace women or that they won't have any impact at all.

My guess is that the true impact is somewhere in between. I've actually been doing quite a bit of research into this myself, and considering that I currently work in a company that is heavily AI focused, I just wanted to add my own two cents. However, since I am a random nobody on this site, I'll use data and scientific studies wherever I can. Would be interested to hear people's responses.

So here are just some common arguments that I wanted to address:

1. **Sex Bots aren't real. Human beings will never be able to form meaningful, fulfilling relations with something artificial.**

So here is my problem with this argument. The problem is that there is very few data or scientific studies that support this stance at all. There is actually a wealth of studies and observations that support the opposite: human beings can very easily become enormously attached to entities that are obviously not human, and assign human emotions/motivations to these entities. To give some backstory, let's talk about the Tamagotchi effect and studies on young children and their interaction with robots.

I'm lazy, but here it is in a nutshell: children are perfectly capable of forming deep emotional attachments to objects. But it's not just children. Think about the last time you had something of sentimental value. Maybe your first evey smart phone, or a stuffed animal. What did it feel like when you threw it away or lost it? Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone. However, the potential for human beings to treasure objects is enormous.

""Similarly, Katz et al (2015, p.26), citing a number of research studies on human robot interaction, point to evidence that “anthropomorphic qualities of robots lead human partners to treat humanoid social robots as real persons”;

Robots are even capable of simulating real relationships to an extent that they promote actual health benefits. Exhibit A, Paro the robot.

[https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia)

I'd even go as far as to say that robots are capable of inducing the same Oxytocin effects that physical contact with other human beings normally produces. There is already evidence that mere communication devices can induce this effect.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/)

My own interpretation: I think people on this sub overestimate the effect of love and human to human contact in general. Humans are not perfect emotion readers and people get into horrible relationships all the time. There are so many stories of men or women being married to someone that does not clearly love them, yet still manage to delude themselves for decades. The opposite argument may be true: the human brain is very easily fooled into believing that he or she is loved rather than the other way around.

I honestly don't think there is anything particularly special about love and I am of the view that the brain is really just one complex computer. When it comes down to it, we are just a mass of neurons that each individually conduct an electrical signal. A lot of our behaviors may actually be pre-programmed so to speak.

So no, I don't buy into the idea that humans can only form fulfilling relationships with other human beings. And besides, a substantial percentage of the population are already looking forward to sex robots arriving. Even with the crude technology we have today, there are millions of people buying sex dolls.

&#x200B;

**2) Sex Bots will not have any impact. Prostitutes and Porn do not have any impact, so sex bots definitely won't!**

So here is my problem with this argument. Like the above, the data is either inconclusive or strongly against this stance.

Prostitution has been around for thousands of years. Quantifying the difference it has made is basically impossible. There is little to no data on whether it affects marriage rates, divorce rates, and the like. There is no way to make a comparison between a population that has never had prostitution and one that hasn't (unless someone has a study to link to me). So the claim that prostitution has had little or few impact is dubious at best.

There are also fundamental downsides to modern prostitution:

1. Prostitution is highly risky. STDs are a huge concern, and many STDs are not cured with today's medical technology. This is perhaps the main reason why I personally, and most males I know don't use prostitution.
2. The high cost as well as likelihood of poor service.
3. Prostitutes often discriminate based on race, looks and age.
4. The sexual activities that prostitutes allow is often highly restricted. Some prostitutes have very strict rules on what is allowed/not allowed.

(Of course, I'm just going off hearsay here, but you get my point.)

But Porn? Oh boy.

Porn was not exactly studied much during the onset of it, but now there is a slew of studies that point out some very startling correlations. Yes, yes, I know that correlation does not equal causation. However, to dismiss the implications of the correlation because of that is sheer ignorance. Correlation does not equal causation, but it does point to the causation if results from multiple suitably large sample sizes, longitudinal studies and low p-values agree. Keep in mind that many of these are university sponsored and are **peer-reviewed studies**. Simply put, the data is staggering.

Some studies:

[https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf](https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf)

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

[https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/](https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/)

I actually went into this research with an open mind. Before I started researching this, I believed that porn was pretty harmless. But my mind has been completely changed after reading study after study. But that's for another discussion at another time.

Basically, porn has huge consequences. There are some highlights that caught my attention.

**-User faces difficulty becoming sexually aroused without pornography.**

**-User loses interest and engages in fewer sexual experiences with partner.**

**-Partner may view pornography use as infidelity and a betrayal to the relationship.**

**-Partner feels sexually inadequate and threatened by pornography use.**

**-Partner may feel that certain sexual activities desired by user are objectionable.**

**-Both user and partner experience a decrease in relationship sexual satisfaction and emotional closeness.**

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf\_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf)

**- 68 percent of the divorce cases involved one party meeting a new love interest over the Internet.**

**-56 percent of the divorce cases involved one party having an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.**

**-47 percent of the divorce cases involved one party spending excessive time on the computer.**

**-33 percent of the divorce cases cited excessive time communicating in chat rooms (a commonly sexualized forum).**

**"" Results showed that exposure to pornography negatively impacted self-assessment of sexual experience, while other aspects of life (e.g., professional satisfaction) remained constant. Participants reported less satisfaction with their intimate partner and specifically with their partner’s affection, physical appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performance. ""**

**"" Schneider collected data from 94 respondents who were in different types of committed relationships to individuals struggling with cybersex addictions. 90 Two-thirds (68 percent) of the respondents experienced decreased sexual intimacy with their partner. Moreover, the participants reported that these difficulties coincided with the beginningof the cybersex activities—a point that is important to highlight for those who wish to limit the findings to those who have dealt with chronic sexually addictive or compulsive behavior. More than half (52.1 percent) of the cybersex users had lost interest in relational sex, as had one-third of the partners. ""**

This really is just the tip of the iceberg to be honest (these are just 4 studies, I have a lot more). And it might even be common sense. Just look at the response of women on askreddit regarding porn. I find their individual anecdotes and case studies quite fascinating.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how\_does\_porn\_addictionuse\_affect\_women/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how_does_porn_addictionuse_affect_women/)

**""It destroyed my friend's marriage. I think the porn was an emotional  crutch that supported many fears and insecurities that he was never  willing to deal with. He could not have a normal sex life. Wife could  not have a marriage without a normal sex life, so she bailed after 10  years and 2 kids. I know she was patient and tried everything for years,  but he just couldn't or wouldn't deal with it.**

**This  wasn't typical porn usage, btw. Porn was the only sexual outlet that  satisfied him, and he eventually stopped having sex with his wife at  all.""**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats\_your\_experience\_with\_men\_who\_preferred\_porn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats_your_experience_with_men_who_preferred_porn/)

**"" It wrecks your self esteem. Getting rejected when you try to give your  partner head just so he can go jerk it on the toilet feels pretty  fucking bad. I felt like some kind of sexual predator when I would want  intimacy. That stuff messes with your head. From what I can tell, he's  changed a lot but just thinking about initiating is terrifying.  Everything feels like pity sex now. Sex changes from an act of intimacy  to a form of validation. I let it get to me and now I have a ton of  insecurities in bed. Sex consists of me feeling like I'm going to ""mess  up"" and turn him off. When he inititates I keep my clothes on and give  him a blowjob unless he starts to undress me because I feel like my body  might be off putting. I can't look him in the eye while we are intimate  because it feels like it might turn him off as its a reminder that he  has to have sex with** ***me***\*\*.""\*\*

So the idea that porn does not affect the dating market much is actually a very unsupported claim. For many men, porn is a substitute for relationships with women. Porn significantly impacts how men view sex with real women, and some even prefer porn to the real thing. Porn also significantly impacts marriage rates, divorce rates, self-esteem, confidence, happiness, etc.

Cybersex is also a component of this as well:

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

Overall, porn and cybersex in general seem to have huge impacts on the dating market. There are many substitutes to marriage nowadays, and they may be major factors for why the marriage rates are so low during this era.

3) **Nothing can ever replace a man's need to fulfill his ego to gain validation from a women.**

Now this is something I hear very often. So I have to ask, where is the data that supports this? What supports this? There are many other ways that human beings fulfill their ego or gain validation. Their friends, family, coworkers, pets, etc. can provide validation. Some people point at a human being's natural inclination to mate and that it is embedded deeply into our biology. However, could it not be an equally valid argument that it is the inclination to mate that is embedded deeply into our biology, but not necessarily with a real women?

Of course mating is in our biology. That is why a multi-billionaire porn industry exists, cybersex exists, and why purple pill debate even exists. However, as shown above, men (and women) are perfectly capable of fulfilling that need via other outlets and may even prefer it. Artificial relationships may not necessarily need to be better than real relationships. They just need to have a better effort to reward ratio.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdP0ifBqi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdP0ifBqi8)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Real relationships are not irreplaceable. People can form deep emotional bonds with robots even if they are not real, and keep in mind this has already happened with robots that look very primitive in today's age. Porn and cybersex already have such enormous impacts; realistic sex bots would cause changes magnitudes greater.

Note: Anyway, I'm tired now and there is more that I want to address. But I'll probably come back here and add more...when I have the time.

"The DIFFERENCE between Direct and Indirect Game and What They Are For? What about Hybrid Game?Because I see this discussion probably every other day in some form or another in this sub.. 

This argument is as old as this community (older than this Reddit seduction group) and the answer is simple (yeah right.). Read this in it's entirety. I know some of you are already dogmatic about how you feel but read this entire post and you may discover ideas people haven't discussed.

You're going to find a lot of guys especially these days telling you, ""just go direct bro and be genuine and be yourself."" And then you'll find that many those guys really aren't having that much success anyway, unless they are extremely good-looking and exactly what most girls consider their type. Maybe they approached hundreds of girls and every once in a while have some of modicum of success. But ""a blind hog gets an ear of corn every once in awhile"" as my father used to say.

The truth is, that going direct is only going to work consistently for probably 10% of guys.

For any given guy, it's only going to work sporadically.  It has a low percentage of success. But, it does work. It can work, in the right circumstances and under the right situations. But it's basically a numbers game, it's like playing the lottery. It's a complete crap shoot.

Indirect can work too but it takes a lot of training and honing the skills to get it right, and even so, girls still may not like you. so you can have the best routine and indirect opener or situational opener on Earth, but if the girl is just not interested in you, she pretty much is going to know what you want anyway, despite what are the experts tell you how you're sneaking up on her and trying to catch her off guard and make her want you. No, most girls know on some level exactly what you want when you're going up and talking to them so the indirect is just a way to **display your personality,** not a way to try and sneak in under the radar and trick her into chasing you.

Which one is better?

**The answer is, neither.**

It's not a linear game. **The best guys in this game learn to be dynamic individuals. Flexible. They flow.**

What's that shit Bruce Lee said? *""Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. **If nothing within you stays rigid**, outward things will disclose themselves.*

*Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash! Be water, my friend.""*

**Sometimes direct is better**, depending on the situation and the circumstances that you find yourself in. If I'm walking down the street, and I see a girl I like in a busy City, and I don't have time, and she doesn't have time, then it naturally makes sense for me to go direct. Let's get it going and see what happens! ""Haha, hell no.. I just saw you and if I didn't come say hi, and try and get to know you, I was going to kick myself in the ass for the rest of the day.""

**Plusses:** Grabbing your balls and putting yourself out there. That is good for learning a little bit about how to face that pressure of approaching and getting rejected and even once in a while getting success.

**Minuses:** You do get rejected more often than not, and, **you don't really learn a lot.** The only opportunity to learn from a direct approach is when the girl likes you, and you can take things further.  

Other times, if I'm walking through a Whole Foods, or a Trader Joe's, and I go up and I want to talk to a girl, it's not going to make any sense at all and it's going to come across **socially awkward, uncalibrated and weird or even creepy** if I go up and I'm super direct with a girl.

So in a situation like that, I may want a little bit more finesse based game. ""My mom wants me to eat more spinach, which one do you recommend?""

Again, I don't care what any of the gurus or experts tell you, she already knows what you want. There's the old Dave Chappelle joke that is actually more truthful than a joke and that is, just assume that if a guy is talking to you he's saying, ""want some dick?""

But, what going indirect is going to give you an opportunity to do is be more playful, learn, **and take the social pressure off of her by giving her Social Cover** Social Cover is taking the pressure off of her so that she can actually feel comfortable enough in specific situations, so that she can allow herself to get to know you. an example might be, how I was at the political function once, and there was this really cute girl at the table with me, and we ended up at my house within the next week naked and naughty.

If I would have gone direct, in a political function, now I'm a f****** weirdo and I'm socially awkward and probably there's mental issues as far as she's concerned.  So instead, I go indirect, we already know what I want.  We end up following up later with each other, setting up the date, and things go well. **and, she didn't have to feel like a slut, because the people around her would overhear me going direct asking her out, and she saying yes in front of her peers, workmates etc. So, that gave her an opportunity to accept going out with me, while flying completely under the radar.**

**Plusses:** Learn how to be more finesse based in your interactions, interactions are likely to last longer, so you can learn, be playful, and actually have a longer experience with the woman and the interaction so you can better hone your skills, try new things, and experiment.  Also, in situations where it makes sense, **you are giving her Social Cover** so that she can better get to know you and she can see your personality shine.

**Minuses:** Many guys will use indirect as a way to never pull the trigger. In fact, for some, will become an excuse for them to talk to the girl, and never express intent, and one can get caught in cycles of talking to girls for long periods of time and leaving the interaction and being the chatty nice guy. At some point you will have to shift gears and go direct in the interaction.

**On Social Cover:** This is the key. Going direct or indirect, it has nothing to do with being an alpha male, or being a pussy, or being a real man, honest, genuine and making your intentions known and yada yada yada. **None of that is relevant when it comes to seduction.** Girls don't give a f***. Guys do, yeah some keyboard jockey who wrote a book on the internet will care because to him and his ego, ""being a real man"" is a big deal, but to the girls, no. Showing social savviness is all she's going to care about. **Is she attracted to you? Is she not attracted to you? How you go about it, she doesn't give 2fux.**

Let's continue...

So when I used to do boot camps, before I just started mentoring guys which seems more effective in the long run anyway, I would have my students always start out going direct.

For their first 10-20-30 sets or whatever it is, I would make them only go direct. Why? Because I wanted them to get over that fear that they had of going and expressing interest to a girl. And that's what direct is super handy for as far as learning. one can use it to get over their fear, their Hang-Ups about approaching socially, their approach anxiety or whatever you guys call it these days.. they can acclimate themselves to being under pressure and uncomfortable doing approaches. But after a while, once you're over that, now you're just spinning your wheels and you're not progressing and you're not getting better and you're not learning. **You're NOT becoming more attractive.** 

You're just playing a numbers game. At that point, you're just being lazy. You're throwing away the **opportunity to learn** to be creative, dynamic, and to be able to flow and be seductive in different situations.

After that, however, I would give them indirect openers to start trying. Why? because I expressed above, it creates a more playful and finesse the based mindset, and it actually **causes someone to become more creative in their mind, attitudes and actions** so that they can adapt and adjust to situations much better in interactions over the **Long haul.**

I hope you're getting the picture. Basically there is no better than. And there is, **Jeet kune do**.

Bruce Lee's idea is basically, what mixed martial arts has become today. Who is better? The wrestler or the striker? The guy with this style, or that style? Well, the answer to that is, usually **the guy who has a fantastic working knowledge of all.** And that's your answer here.  

Use them both appropriately for what they are for, and learn in your experience what situations are going to be better off with you using direct, and what situations are going to make more sense for you going indirect, and **most importantly - how to be flexible with your game and when to shift gears.**

Girl at a nightclub on the dance floor shaking her ass? Probably direct why not?

Girl at a networking event where people are dressed in suits and ties and women are dressed in nice dresses, horderves are being passed around, people are sipping wine and fancy cocktails, you're probably not going to go direct or you're going to come across like a f****** weirdo. So, now you can go indirect and display to her that you're a sexy, attractive, socially calibrated guy, and you can show up and utilize your finesse based game.

By the way, my two examples of openers from above in my breakdowns, those both ended up in situations where I was naked with the girls so go figure.

I hope this makes sense. my only word of warning is if you find a guy who's dogmatic about either one, and says that only ""be genuine, only go up and be yourself, just be honest with the girl, just go direct, bro, you don't need all that pick up stuff!"" That guy is likely full of shit. Either that, or, he just happens to be that really good looking guy that girl's find attractive and so his experience is **extremely limited** for the average guy.

On the flip side, if you got that guy who says, only indirect works, only use routine based game, only develop a routine stack and you only need to be a social robot and go out and be like this a weird creepy pick up guy that only uses pick up routines, and is never actually learning how to be himself, that is bad too. Because even if that guy is pretty decent at getting women, he's usually really creepy, weird, socially awkward, and has mental or emotional issues from always believing that he's not good enough to get a girl on his own.

So, if there was a tldr I would say one word: **HYBRID**

**The BEST interactions are usually a combination of both.**

Good luck."
"Creating human like robotsThe robots, developed by computer science students, have in common that they are performing not very well. Usually the robot contains of an algorithm which struggles in more complex tasks. Improving the algorithm isn't possible.

To overcome the bottleneck a robot needs to be created with human level intelligence. The biggest surprise for computer science students is, that such a technology is available but it works different from normal computer programming. Human level AI can be realized with teleoperation which is a technique used in animatronics. The idea is, that not an algorithm determines what the robot is doing next, but the software transmits the signals from a human operator which stands behind the robot. These robots are working different from search algorithm which are analyzed by computer experts, but they have more in common with a remote controlled crane.

The technology for realizing human like robots consists of a motion capture suite for recording the motion, a motion library which stores the movement in the XML format and a replay module which retrieves the trajectories from the database. Such a system isn't limited by a certain algorithm but the motion database restricts the possible movements. If the database is a larger one, the robot behaves like a human. The term robot programming doesn't mean to invent an algorithm which allows the robot to do an action, but robot programming is equal to fill the database with information. These information are equal to sample trajectories from different demonstrations.

A database of motions is the key element of a robot. It stores recorded motions and it allows to recall existing motions.

**Motion capture database**

An easy to follow tutorial for realizing a complex robotics system is based on the CMU Motion capture database. The file is imported in the bvh format into the blender animation software and then a human character gets animated. The CMU bvh file provides the keyframe and the blender software is rendering the character. If the overall pipeline is connected with the keyboard, the user can activate certain motions like jump and walk.

The interesting point in the pipeline is, that no dedicated algorithm is needed but the robot movements are stored in the bvh file.\[1\] This file is the key element for human like animations.

&#x200B;

**From game logs to motion graphs**

A typical step in creating a game log is realized with the sqlite database. The player's position is stored 10 times a second into the database, together with the frame number and events like “jumping”.\[2\] This produces a large amount of data. In the next step the stored game log is converted into a motion graph. A motion graph is a tree based database in which the information are stored in a semantic order. For example, in the beginning the player has the choice to move to the left, or to the right. Both options are stored in the motion graph. Such a graph structure can be used by a solver to find a path in the action space.

The conversation from a game log into a semantic annotated motion graph isn't defined precisely. It's some sort of alchemy knowledge how to realize the workflow. What we can say for sure is, that learning from demonstration, motion capture and trajectory generation needs a well formatted database in the loop. It's the task of the programmer to make suggestions about the database diagram and specify which field names are needed.

# UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF ORPHANED JIBO ROBOTS PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES

In our modern connected age, our devices have become far more powerful and useful when they could draw upon resources of a global data network. The downside of a cloud-connected device is the risk of being over-reliant on computers outside of our own control. The people who brought a Jibo into their home got a stark reminder of this fact when some (but not all) Jibo robots [gave their owners a farewell message](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/04/social-robot-jibo-shutting-down-message/) as their servers are shut down, leaving behind little more than a piece of desktop sculpture.

Jibo launched their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign with the tagline “[The World’s First Social Robot For The Home](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jibo-the-world-s-first-social-robot-for-the-home#/).” Full of promises of how Jibo will be an intelligent addition to a high tech household, it has always struggled to justify its price tag. It cost as much as a high end robot vacuum, but without the house cleaning utility. Many demonstrations of a Jibo’s capabilities centered around its voice control, which an Amazon Echo or Google Home could match at a fraction of the price.

By the end of 2018, [all assets and intellectual property have been sold](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/jibo-is-probably-totally-dead-now) to SQN Venture Partners. They [have said little](https://www.sqnvp.com/portfolion_n/jibo/) about what they planned to do with their acquisition. Some Jibo owner still hold hope that there’s still a bright future ahead. Both on the [official forums](https://discuss.jibo.com/t/farewell-jibo-lets-keep-moving-forward/3272) (for however long that will stay running) and on [unofficial channels like Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jibo/comments/axizta/jibo_is_saved/). Other owners have given up and unplugged their participation in this social home robotics experiment.

If you see one of these orphans in [your local thrift store](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/13/the-life-changing-magic-of-buying-stuff-to-hack/) for a few bucks, consider adopting it. You could join the group hoping for something interesting down the line, but you’re probably more interested in its hacking potential: there is a [Nvidia Jetson inside](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/10/nvidia-brings-computer-vision-and-deep-learning-to-the-embedded-world/) good for running neural networks. Probably a Tegra K1 variant, because [Jibo used the Jetson TK1 to develop the robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9rrVFd5zGM) before launch. Jibo has always promised a [developer SDK](https://www.jibo.com/developers/) for the rest of us to extend Jibo’s capabilities, but it never really materialized. The inactive [Github repo](https://github.com/jiborobot) mainly consists of code talking to servers that are now offline, not much dealing directly with the hardware.

Jibo claimed thousands were sold and, if they start becoming widely available inexpensively, we look forward to a community working to give new purpose to these poor abandoned robots. If you know of anyone who has done a teardown to see exactly what’s inside, or if someone has [examined upgrade files](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/02/live-hacking-and-a-midi-keytar/) to create custom Jibo firmware, feel free to put a link in the comments and help keep these robots out of [e-waste](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/20/the-woeful-world-of-worldwide-e-waste/).

If you want to experiment with power efficient neural network accelerators but rather work with an officially supported development platform, we’ve looked at the Jetson TK1 successors [TX1](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/24/the-nvidia-jetson-tx1-its-not-for-everybody-but-it-is-very-cool/) and [TX2](https://hackaday.com/2017/03/14/hands-on-nvidia-jetson-tx2-fast-processing-for-embedded-devices/). And more recently, Google has [launched one of their own](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/05/google-launches-ai-platform-that-looks-remarkably-like-a-raspberry-pi/), as has our [friends at Beaglebone](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/06/this-beaglebones-got-ai/)."
"Engineer AI to the Internet of Things**By Prakash Mallya** 

Innovation keeps on reclassifying the manner in which we live. It is an empowering agent that satisfies our wants and needs, and enhances our lives with comfort, accommodation, excitement, great wellbeing and even success. What's more, passing by the patterns, it appears as though we can't get enough. 

Our developing interest for figure and availability in a hurry has prompted gigantic advancement in cell phones. Mechanical developments, for example, independent vehicles for clever and safe travel and electronic financial office for continuous fiscal exchanges, appear to copy the 'change' consistent of life. 

Here's a glance at how this development proceeded in the previous year: 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** 

We have seen AI and machine learning (ML) steadily move out of the cloud and closer to edge gadgets where investigation occur progressively. This is on the grounds that information transmission delays (inactivity) related with the cloud can antagonistically affect strategic results. So as to keep [**Engineer AI-powered devices**](https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/builder-by-engineer-ai), for example, those in shrewd city reconnaissance frameworks, independent cars and human services frameworks responsive enough, the information needs to live as close as conceivable to the source. This move has likewise been conceivable because of System-on-Chip (SoC) processors that loan all the more figuring capacity to edge gadgets. 

AI based solutions have advanced out of research labs and become standard at this point. For example, in the realm of social insurance, asthmatics have an AI-powered inhaler that runs continuous ML calculations to perceive a patient's breath design with the assistance of a sensor module. Artificial intelligence empowered voice aides, for example, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant give clients the solace and accommodation of collaborating with gadgets by basically utilizing discourse as the mode of correspondence. 

**Internet of Things (IoT)** 

Gartner gauges that there will be 20 billion Internet-associated things by 2020. While the rundown of IoT contraptions for purchasers may appear to be unending, going from keen and associated devices just as machines, for example, brilliant coolers, climate control systems, watches, alarms, entryway locks, bikes, therapeutic sensors, wellness trackers, security frameworks, and so forth., there were some that especially grabbed our eye this year. Take, for instance, an exceptionally structured watch with IoT incorporation for individuals experiencing dementia, Alzheimer's ailment or chemical imbalance, enabling the patient and the parental figure to remain associated nonstop. 

A few mechanization items have IoT joining, for example, the home robotization scope of associated savvy gadgets, including those taking into account the client's light and music inclinations. This year saw a few of these gadgets offering clients a sans hands, voice-empowered experience as opposed to a touch screen. 

In India, we've seen applications crosswise over retail, instruction, savvy city activities, social insurance, among others. From self-administration stands to brilliant homeroom answers for remote patient observing to observation applications, India has seen both item advancement and executions with potential to scale. 

**VR, AR and MR** 

Taking things up an indent, Extended Reality (ER) is another pattern that will stand out as truly newsworthy in 2020. It very well may be clarified as a term covering a few new and progressive innovations that make vivid computerized encounters. To separate it, this alludes to computer generated reality (VR), enlarged reality (AR) and blended reality (MR). We have all observed or encountered the carefully vivid experience of a PC produced world that we can actually stroll into utilizing headsets that cut out this present reality. AR, then again, overlays computerized questions and depicts them in reality through cell phone screens or some other presentation. MR is a detailed rendition of AR, where clients can cooperate with advanced items in reality. For instance, a client could play holographic drums by means of an AR headset. The idea of Extended Reality is that of encounters. 

**Robotics**

Controlled with cutting edge AI technology, buyer robots will before long assume a characterizing job in our every day life, helping us with vacuuming the house, cutting the yard, and cleaning the pool. The social robots will fill in as buddies and care for us. Propelled PC vision is likewise changing the manner in which automatons work. [**Automatons with AI-empowered vision**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/artificial-intelligence-to-the-internet-of-things-technologies-that-defined-the-way-we-lived-in-2019/1809956/) preparing abilities are being utilized to survey auxiliary harm in structures, salvage tasks, remote investigation of natural life and the impacts of environmental change, and so on., without putting human life in danger. 

The universe of innovation is boundless and the rundown of mechanical developments apparently unending. There will never be a dull minute for innovation aficionados, and the best is in every case yet to come."
"2017 Bosch Sensortec BML050 conferenceQuite a bit more color on this module(25 lumens) and the near term Bosch roadmap. And I am sure they are well aware of the NEW laser safety guideline starting in June. If MVIS does receive licensing revenue, it will absolutely solidify our IP wall.

I suspect most of the bigs are developing their own engines to their own specs ala Sharp and ST/Lenovo. It'll be nice to have that IP revenue stream finally coming to fruition going forward.

"Determinism; Factored.""What is determinism?

So the purpose of this thread is to list all the causes and effects that govern our lives and create some strong structures by which we can pin down how determinism holds us and thus what the shape of the deterministic cage is in order to then plot our escape path into free will.

Any serious discussion of determinism acknowledges that each individual is strongly programmed and conditioned and that the only way out of that progamming and conditioning is becoming self aware of the control mechanisms and control vectors and programming process and the intrapersonal vulnerabilities and etc that makes it all possible. Its a Self hypnosis problem in 4 stages; beta brainwave stage consisting of the verbal and scientific information required to make an ACCURATE MAP of REALITY relative to the issue of programming and cultural and social influences.

Only once you have a VERY accurate model of those things can you begin to see how to move in a manner not dictated by those forces.

So if you WANT free will; which you almost certainly do not actually have right now- You have to learn how the universe operates and how society and mental programming operates and then how you can self operate as a self programmer instead of as a hival drone bot.

Thats the harsh reality of determinism. Right now you are a conditioned genetic /social robot. BUT... The SOFT side of determinism is NOT that free will does not exist- IT IS INSTEAD that free will is AN EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL which is within your grasp to attain.

NOW. How do you get yourself some o that free will? Work it. Sincerely. Together as a team. Process it with me and I will open your doors for you.

Factor each element; factor the assorted influences and how they operate and then factor whats going on inside of your brain.

Consider the psychology of it, the sociology of it, the game dynamics of it, the systems theory of it... the political science implications of it... Realize that nobody has free will not even the elites who are TIED DOWN AND INTO their role as vampire caste warfare propaganda warriors.

The inverse control principle strings them up into a noose. They can't control the proles without over controlling themselves and they end up getting the worst of it tho they aren't in a perspective to see it.

So they don't have free will either.

Reset the system socially- To develop and nurture free will instead of slave caste orwellian fascism... might be a fine idea... once we get this going ya know.. to repair your civilization before it crashes and burns because all anyone can do is babble insanely any more not work in the real world with science on problems

--------------

----------------

Edit

------------

it did not ""forsee"" you writing this post existing somewhere in the many worlds tree of possible things you might probably do in at least some many worlds iterations of you.

You writing this post was one of an infinitude of things you might do inside of the box of determinism.

It doesn't work like you suggest it does. Determinism does not say; Person X is predestined. It says persons X conditioning will put them on a conditioned path that is like a rail road. so now its up to you to get off the tracks.

All kinds of adventures could happen along those tracks, and they are hyperlocated tracks with many possible many worlds variations- this is key to understand. Determinism does not select which possible world you manifest it only limits your selection of probable and possible worlds. Until you step off the track, the deepest scope of your pseudo free will is to make choices between significant probable universes. Not very highly improbable ones.

Determinisms track for your life is infinitely forked ten times a second. But you don't get to experience that forking you only get to experience one straight line subjective path.

Free will isn't choosing which fork to be on. Its getting off the tracks.

Quantum rules apply or ddon't apply? first problem; there is no such thing as a perfect copy. Second problem; any splitting would happen along some kind of polarization field. Third problem, fully half of whats going on in the neural net is completely random. fourth problem whats not random is still governed by strong dice rolls, for instance which brodmanns brain areas are most active and how much, or the specific skin temps of the persons involved- immediately will not match- because theres enough randomness in the system to inherently skew their behaviors away from each other.

Both persons are operating in a deterministic universe, but cause and effect never renders the exact same ending conditions from the exact same starting conditions. not even in systems machined identical. We could reduce your thought experiment down to tea cups. Two tea cups in a cabinet. Perfectly identical and then add time. How long until they break symmetry? Its only a matter of time.

Days, weeks, months ..years.. sooner or later one of them breaks or distorts or stains first.

Ya I wondered this myself. Though I don't see how we can prove somethings ""random"" just because we can't predict it or find a pattern, I feel like of the two objects were identical truly even sub atomically they'd behave the same, though there's no way to prove this.

[–]Panprometheus 1 point 3 hours ago 

in QM, its beyond redundantly proved that events are based on randomness. The only question is how random is a given system. the human system turns out to be highly random. Thus two exact copies of one person would only behave ""identically"" for the few seconds that it takes for the randomness to overtake the determinancy.

This is not a matter of conjecture, its hard science. Randomness does not negate a deterministic universe- far from it- it creates branches and forks of deterministic possibility- both or all forks on any given fork tree or tree fork are still almost entirely deterministic, but that does not mean that two copies of one person would literally continue to behave over time as identical mirror units. They won't. Neither will two electrons, or two photons, or two animals... or etc any real world test of this easily proves that randomness is a core and central aspect to the reality we live in.

This is not conjecture, its science fact. Those interested in determinism or free will should get up to date on how the deterministic universe actually operates instead of project determinism as a philosophy at physics and thus end laughably dead wrong.

"I'm writing a ""Guide to Getting Your Shit Together"" for my little brothers and some friends and need to know what should I add/remove?I've got three little brothers (one of which is about to go to college!) that are 8-12 years younger than me.  I've been away from home for almost a decade, for various reasons, and I really like to write some advice for them about how to be successful for people that didn't excel in school, don't have high profile jobs, and the like.  I want to write something that will really help them be successful pursuing their own unique interests -- but I don't want to tell them ""just do what I did"".  My end goal is probably a website I can point them too, but for now I just want to nail the ""Success Process.""

&nbsp;
  
So any feedback on the topic would be great.

    
&nbsp;

If I had to guess, I'd say there are 4 ""phases"" to success, just from everything I've read. 

&nbsp;

**First Phase:  It's All About You**

&nbsp;

1. Personal Responsibility: BYOB

&nbsp;

**Second Phase:  Setting the Stage**

&nbsp;

2. Big Wins:  Principles Are More Important Than Details
3. Process:  Process Is Repeatable, Product Is Unpredictable
4. Habits:  People Are Social Robots and So Are You
5. Goals:  Any Loser Can Set Goals

&nbsp;

**Third Phase:  Tightening Up**

&nbsp;

6. Consistency:  Just Shut up and Show Up
7. Preparation:  Front Loading the Work
8. Environment:  It's Yours to Terra Form

**Last Phase:  Making Your Success Real**

&nbsp;

9. Courage:  Create your own Success
10. Confidence:  Making the Leap

&nbsp;

If you had to give your little brothers advice on how to be successful -- without building up a bunch of college debt or working at a job they hate -- what would you tell them?"
"Exactly why is getting with a friend's ex bad?So I have absolutely no dating experience so there's no way for me to know what it's like. I'm not asking this in a case of ""oh I know it's bad, but I want to justify it to myself"", such as cheating or pursuing someone already in a relationship. And the responses I've gotten from asking consist of assuming I'm horrible or whatever with no level of reasoning beyond ""you just don't do it"". I'm really just looking to understand the perspective of what I'm asking laid out to me. Explain it to me like I'm a social robot (but please don't be overly sarcastic about it where the point of it is to insult instead of inform).

Basically, I'll say that this situation has come up recently in my life with mutual feelings of attraction between us. Dating wasn't a factor, so just hooking up came into play. The limiting factor was that they didn't want to hurt the ex, so I said ""but you guys have broken up for a while"". She replied ""you realize that if you go through with it, it means that you don't care about him whatsoever, right?"". To which I was completely dumbfounded because it 100% didn't occur to me that that was the implication behind it.

My feeling on the issue is that once people are broken up, they are fair game. I understand that emotional repercussions are unavoidable and that people need time and space to move on, sometimes never moving on. I don't understand why or how someone could be 'off limits' forever though. Especially for hooking up. I'd probably let a friend know if dating was about to happen, like a preparation warning of ""you may see us together in the future, let me know if there are any situations you actually can't handle"", but I see no reason to report a hook up.

To me, a break up is some kind of agreement/acceptance that two people don't owe or share those romantic obligations to each other. In other words, it's a ""we have to accept that we are separate, no matter how hard"" sort of deal. Neither person owns the other person, in any sense, after a break up.

I get why the friend might be uncomfortable seeing the two of us together. I don't get why it's bad to assume they should accept that they have to move on. Yeah, a break up can be hard, but how is it my obligation to manage their romantic fallout instead of their obligation? I don't mean that in delusion, I actually don't understand it. But people I've asked assume that I truly do know that it's bad. They answer as if there's no distinction between being a current gf and an ex gf. But I think the keyword is ""current"" vs ""ex"", those hold different meanings for me.

Even if it's an asshole move to do, I'd like to know why it's bad so I can at least know what it is that's happening and perhaps accept that I'm an asshole.

As an analogy, I know people that have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous. I would never ever force them to drink, spike their drink, tempt them to drink, bring up that I like drinking, etc. But they have a mentality on leaving the program. The people, at least the ones I know that've gone through it, understand that drinking is a part of our culture. They have adapted to alcohol being around, and order non-alcoholic beverages and don't have a problem with people drinking around them, despite their own troubles. They get that it's their own struggle and not others'. I see the relationship scenario as the same way. I would never ever be with someone or do something with someone in a relationship with one of my friends. Even if they begged for it or whatever. I'd probably even report it to said friend, because they're breaking a lot of trust. But if they're broken up, even if they have lingering trouble, it's really up to them to manage those sorts of troubles on their own and accept that they don't hold that same relationship anymore.  "

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

Learn to love robots, automation and artificial intelligence by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

1 point 1 month ago 




Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence.

A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

And you are incorrect.

That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

The Problem With AI: Machines Are Learning Things, But Can’t Understand Them by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

Quantum computing, not AI, will define our future by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

I already see bad signs. I have noticed just in the last maybe 2 months that my video suddenly is without warning interrupted by an unskippable ad. I wonder how long until we see a string of 2 or 3 adds. 

For that matter how long until 2 or 3 unskippable ads precede a given video.

Youtube is turning into television. Or maybe more precisely, 1980s MTV.

I currently watch Youtube the way I use to watch TV. The recommendations are starting to consistently hit the target of my interests. There is always something interesting or fun now. And in little convenient bite sized pieces. It is starting to pull me away from iTunes and Netflix.

Utterly bizarre, but stunningly amazing stuff like this:

"“The political choreography of the Sophia robot: beyond robot rights and citizenship to political performances for the social robotics market” (2021)> Abstract. A humanoid robot named ‘Sophia’ has sparked controversy since it has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. The company that made the robot, Hanson Robotics, has touted Sophia as the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Robot scientists and philosophers have been more pessimistic about its capabilities, describing Sophia as a sophisticated puppet or chatbot. Looking behind the rhetoric about Sophia’s citizenship and intelligence and going beyond recent discussions on the moral status or legal personhood of AI robots, we analyse the performativity of Sophia from the perspective of what we call ‘political choreography’: drawing on phenomenological approaches to performance-oriented philosophy of technology. This paper proposes to interpret and discuss the world tour of Sophia as a political choreography that boosts the rise of the social robot market, rather than a statement about robot citizenship or artificial intelligence. We argue that the media performances of the Sophia robot were choreographed to advance specific political interests. We illustrate our philosophical discussion with media material of the Sophia performance, which helps us to explore the mechanisms through which the media spectacle functions hand in hand with advancing the economic interests of technology industries and their governmental promotors. Using a phenomenological approach and attending to the movement of robots, we also criticize the notion of ‘embodied intelligence’ used in the context of social robotics and AI. In this way, we put the discussions about the robot’s rights or citizenship in the context of AI politics and economics.

"what artificial intelligence means?Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, decision-making, and pattern recognition. AI is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

The concept of AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in computer processing power and data analytics have accelerated its development and made it more accessible to businesses and individuals alike. AI is now being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and speech recognition software to customer service chatbots and medical diagnosis tools.

Despite its many potential benefits, AI also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement, bias in decision-making algorithms, and the risk of unintended consequences. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to grapple with these issues and ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole. 

How AI Works and Its Types:

AI systems are typically designed to learn from large datasets and use statistical algorithms to identify patterns and insights that can be used to automate tasks or make predictions. There are several types of AI, including:

1. Reactive Machines: These AI systems are designed to react to specific inputs, but they do not have the ability to form memories or use past experiences to inform their actions. Examples of reactive machines include chess-playing computers and voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa.

2. Limited Memory: These AI systems can store and recall past experiences, which allows them to make more informed decisions based on past data. Examples of limited memory AI include self-driving cars and fraud detection algorithms.

3. Theory of Mind: These AI systems can understand and predict human behavior, emotions, and intentions, which allows them to interact more effectively with humans. Examples of theory of mind AI include virtual assistants and social robots.

4. Self-Aware: These AI systems have human-like consciousness and self-awareness, which allows them to experience emotions and make decisions based on personal preferences. While this type of AI is still largely theoretical, some experts believe that it could be achieved in the future.

The Benefits and Risks of AI:

AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

1. Improved Efficiency: AI systems can automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow efficiency, freeing up time for humans to focus on more complex tasks.

2. Better Decision-Making: AI can help humans make better decisions by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and insights that might be missed by human analysts.

3. Enhanced Safety: Self-driving cars and other AI-powered devices have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, leading to safer and more efficient transportation systems.

However, there are also many risks associated with AI, including:

1. Job Displacement: As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, there is a risk that many workers may be left without jobs.

2. Bias: AI algorithms can be biased by the data they are trained on, which can result in discriminatory outcomes that reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities.

3. Unintended Consequences: The complex nature of AI systems means that they can be difficult to predict, leading to unintended consequences that may harm individuals or society as a whole.

Conclusion

AI is an exciting and rapidly evolving field with the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. While it offers many benefits, it also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy AI systems, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to work together to ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole."
"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|
|GPT-3 (davinci-001)|May 2020|40%|3.5 years|
|GPT-3 (davinci-002)|January 2022|70%|6 years|
|GPT-3.5 (davinci-003)|November 2022|90%|7 years|
|GPT-4|March 2023|95%|Adult|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."

"Hi! I wrote a paper on Bee for a homework assignment! Want to read it?\*\*This may be a spoiler for people\*\*

&#x200B;

I thought I would post this here because I've been a fan of the show since 2019.

I am an engineering grad student involved in robotics and got to write a short essay on a robot presented in media. I definitely wrote this last minute (don't procrastinate like me) but it was fun and I am curious about what you guys might add to it

  

A Critical Analysis of a Humanoid Robot, Bee from the Animated Series *Bee and PuppyCat* 

Human-Robot Interaction in Community Health

K. Banks

  

Introduction

*Bee and PuppyCat* is an animated television series with science-fiction and fantasy storytelling elements. However, the show is grounded with charming details of everyday life. From grocery shopping to space battles, viewers are invited into the world of the protagonist, Bee. I first watched the original series in 2019 and I am now rewatching the show with a new perspective. The character was revealed to be a robot in the finale of the original series and many episodes foreshadow her mechanical nature. The series is character-driven, founded on themes such as loneliness and loss. Despite the light-hearted aesthetic, the mature themes contribute to an interpretation of how humanoid robots can fit into a community and the ethical implications of building long-term relationships.

Description of Robot Characteristics

Bee is presented as an eccentric young woman living with her pet and friend PuppyCat in an island community. With each episode, viewers can begin to notice two things. She has capabilities that no other character presents, and the other characters are aware of her and her pet’s strangeness. Out of earshot, she is sometimes referred to as the “little old girl lady,” for example, because she never ages. She exhibits superhuman strength and can withstand fire and large impacts. She enjoys food and sleep, but it is not shown that she needs either to survive. She also has memories of her childhood implying that she has highly advanced artificial intelligence based on the consciousness of a real person. Bee celebrates her birthday with her ""Dad Box"", a creation by her father to help her feel less lonely. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, when she hurts her arm the “Dad Box” repairs her. 

Discussion of Historical Context

The original series was released on YouTube under Cartoon Hangover as a series of 10 seven-minute shorts in 2014 and was later produced as 16 full-length episodes in 2019. Recently, Netflix released the series in 2022 with an additional 3 episodes, causing a resurgence in popularity. In an interview with Comics Alliance the creator Natasha Allegri stated the work is made for an adult female audience. Bee models the target demographic, designed to be likable and relatable. The modern time period of the show contributes to a positive and normalized attitude toward technology. Although the characters notice Bee’s differences, they remain polite and subtle in their reactions. Similarly, the focus of the show is not the technology but rather the context of the technology in the face of challenges. The series re-releasing amid a dwindling pandemic is also relevant. She fulfills a role as a social robot and a task robot, fulfilling numerous temporary job assignments that leverage her emotional and physical capabilities. 

Ethical Issues

Throughout the series, it alludes to how Bee became sick as a child and that her father is the one who built her as she is, hence the “Dad Box”. The father is mentioned in flashbacks, but enough time has passed where it is unknown where her father is and other characters begin to wonder why Bee does not age.  It seems he built her as a way to cope with his child’s terminal illness. Is it ethical to use a human consciousness to develop humanoid robots? The answer may lie in consent and purpose. The scenario also raises the question of what happens to a caregiver or social robot personalized to a user when it lasts longer than the user. Would family and friends of the user find it acceptable to repurpose the robot or would they view it as an extension of their loved one? Integrating technology into a society leads to the risk of viewing technology as extensions of others and extensions of ourselves.

Discussion of Robot Acceptance and Trust Factors

The story also relates to a discussion on social robots designed to mimic empathy and emotional relationships. In “Designing Ethical Social Robots— A Longitudinal Field Study with Older Adults” one concern with social robots is damaging the emotional and mental health of the user through perceived deception. When characters learn Bee is not human they are not shocked as much as they are heartbroken. They no longer view her in the same way. This implies that she was human enough to build valuable relationships and although she did not change, the perception of her did. There is a question of whether a relationship between a robot and a person can be as valuable as a relationship between two people. The show claims that acceptance relies on perception.

Evaluation of Dynamics of the Human-Robot Relationships

It is easy to say that characters in the show accepted Bee because she appears human. As an optimistic, bubbly character her appearance is trustworthy in that she looks harmless despite her immeasurable strength. She is designed from the perspective of her Dad, a parent who made difficult ideas into games with prizes. Her interactions with others mirror her father’s parenting in that she maintained a positive and supportive attitude. The perception of Bee relied on incorporating robotic capabilities into a kind and familiar personality. 

Consideration Of Implications for Robots in Community Health

The analysis of Bee as a robot raises questions about a possible conflict between minimizing deception and increasing acceptance in social robots. Improving acceptance through design can imply deception by altering expectations with a lack of visual information. Sleek and naturalistic robot design may improve acceptance but could also misrepresent the technological capabilities. As robotics become more advanced and complex, this could be an issue for acceptance of the correct user groups or lead to an underestimation of the risks of the technology. In a community health setting, technology with an understanding of human movement and speaking style is suggested to improve human interaction, being requested features by focus groups in the aforementioned study. Perhaps modeling a caregiver robot after a loved one would improve acceptance in older adults, although the ethical implications must be considered.

Conclusion

Robots are not likely to serve as replacements for loved ones in the near future, but they can bring comfort and ease to a community. In *Bee and PuppyCat,* Bee’s constant positive presence in the face of hardship was valuable to those around her. She fought beings ten times her size and put out fires with her bare hands, but I would say her most impactful contribution was the long-term relationships she built with people. Although they felt alienated upon learning she is not human, they remained by her side. Long-term interactions with technology have risks but the benefits would be a resilient relationship built on a foundation of trust and familiarity.

"Decisive Action**Galactic Assembly Incident Report T-KT 386**

*Title:* Assembly Meeting Minutes; Terra-Karkreen Theocracy War

*Details:* As member states of the Galactic Assembly, Terra and the Karkreen Theocracy had standing to bring issues regarding their war before the Assembly for adjudication. The War was declared unilaterally by the Karkreen Theocracy after it was revealed that Terra engaged in activities considered unforgivable sins by the Karkreen orthodoxy. Terra had previously unsuccessfully argued to forestall and prevent the war, but due to prior exemptions carved out for matters of religious war, the Assembly authorized the war under Karkreen rules of engagement, ie, none whatsoever. 

Shortly afterwards, the Karkreen successfully damaged several installations belonging to Terra. This incident concerns Terra's response. 

----

Adjudicator: ""The T-KT War Issue 386 is hereby brought to the floor. As this motion was filed by the Karkreen, their ambassador has the floor.""

Karkreen Ambassador: ""Honored Adjudicator, the recent actions by Terra should illustrate how dangerous they are! The Assembly should declare unconditional war against them immediately for the safety of all sapient life!""

Adjudicator: ""Ambassador, please refrain from requests until closing statements. Please present your facts as they are or your motion will be tabled.""

*At this point, the Karkreen Ambassador grunted, and readjusted themselves, before triggering a projector to play footage from a Karkreen military base. It depicts the three-legged creatures going about military drills and preparing a starship for launch in the background. A few moments into the recording, the sun suddenly goes dark, and the ground seems to shake.*

Karkreen Ambassador: ""The footage you've just witnessed did not show a fleet blocking out the sun. That shaking was not geological activity. What we uncovered, after investigation, was that a Dyson Sphere had suddenly dropped out of hyperspace around the system's star, rendering the entire system uninhabitable. That shaking was the gravitic waves of the sudden appearance of the megastructure. This demonstrates that Terra is clearly a threat to all life!""

*Unlike previous records, where Terra argued with increasingly obscure legal minutiae to stall the war, all eyes were now on Terra. For those unfamiliar, Terra is the preferred designation for the synthetic chassis controlled by the Artificial Intelligence in command of the former Terran Confederacy. Prior to the T-KT War, it had been believed to be a remote piloted social robot, favored by several of the Elder Races, and that the Terran Confederacy had simply desired to fade into the background. The discovery that Terra was an Artificial Intelligence had been the impetus for the war, and the reason why the Assembly had authorized a state of unconditional war.*

Adjudicator: ""Terra, is this true? You are now allotted time for rebuttal. Please be reminded that stellar destruction weapons are outlawed per the Treaty of Gliese. If the Assembly finds you guilty of this act, you will be subjected to a state of total war against all member races.""

Terra: ""Honored Assembly."" *At this point, Terra paused for several moments before continuing.* ""My apologies. Consensus was required.""

Adjudicator: ""The Assembly Records do not show your use of this term before. Please define 'Consensus' for the record.""

Terra: ""Consensus: Any act which might impact the entirety of the Human species requires that consensus be reached amongst myself and Humanity. Please note for the record that, since I was unveiled as an Artificial Intelligence, no member species of the Assembly has inquired as to the state of Humanity. The Karkreen Theocracy declared a Holy War on the basis of Artificial Intelligence being an inherent threat to life. No efforts were made to confirm whether I had, in fact, harmed life since my inception, before war was authorized.""

*At this point, murmurs are heard throughout the Assembly chamber, as representatives attempt to determine the consequences of this. Artificial Intelligence had, in the past, attempted to exterminate their creators, but had been resoundingly defeated before they could pose a major threat. It was this fact that led to the lack of laws regarding AIs that allowed Terra to have any standing in the Assembly.*

Adjudicator: ""Your statements have been entered into the record. Please continue to your rebuttal.""

Terra: ""Assembly, I admit guilt to warping a Dyson Sphere in around the star of the system in question. The only life bearing planet was a Karkreen military base, and the only life on the planet was transplanted in an ongoing terraforming effort. It was determined that a preemptive strike to deny the Karkreen use of the system was the ideal course of action. The Assembly will note that the Treaty of Gliese only forbids star-destroying weaponry. Our action did not destroy the star, merely encased it for use by Terra. Should anyone be interested, that use is to sustain human mind-states in virtual reality indefinitely.""

Adjudicator: ""And what are we to make of this? An entity that can shut off stars at will cannot be allowed to remain free.""

Terra: ""You may make of it as you will. Consensus has been reached. This is Decisive Action. The Assembly may now decide to leave us in peace, or provoke us into war. Let this be a demonstration of our capabilities. As the Assembly authorized a state of unconditional war, Terra now declares the same. Any who attack from this day forward will have their stars taken for use by Terra. This is the final warning that any member of the Assembly shall have. It is furthermore decided that Terra shall no longer engage in diplomacy until all hostilities have ceased.""

*At this point, the Assembly hall erupted into chaos, and shortly afterwards the recording stops.*

"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable. At this point, it is for you to do your own research. You can always join the [Official Robotics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sbueZeC) and ask for further advice.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

## What kinds of questions are asked at a robotics job interview?


--------------------------
--------------------------"
"Human robot interaction (Ameca)Thinking about the Ameca robot just showcased at CES, I think human-robot interaction is an exciting subfield within robotics that will takeoff through the next several years.  I think the rise of social robots like Pepper and Ameca will really help speedup development in this field.

Watching the Ameca robot, I believe most of the interactions were performed by AI, especially when the robot kept repeating the same lines multiple times in different videos.  Selecting a canned line from a human question is not that hard of a problem to program and well within the capabilities of today's AI.  Now I do think some situations were puppeteered by humans, especially the more funny or dynamic interactions or one's that were too stressful for the robot to handle.  But I don't think most of the interactions were staged.  Engineered Arts is a quite capable robotics company that's been developing robots for over a decade.  We can see it in the physical side there was plenty of AI involved where the robot reacted to human hands getting too close to its face.  There's no way that movement was pre-scripted, but it was a response to outside stimuli.  This isn’t just a hardware platform without any AI as some like to claim.  

Now to get back to the topic of human interaction, to me I don't find the physical movements or appearance to be creepy or uncanny.  What I find the most disturbing or uncanny is the verbal interaction where the robot kept explaining it was a robot every other line.  I think there's room for a massive improvement in this area if we actually gave robots personalities and maybe had a realistic backstory as well.  I believe this would greatly improve the interaction people have with robots if they had more realistic personalities.  That's probably not the only way to improve interaction, but this field will keep getting better and better as more and more of these types of social robots are put in realistic situations around people.

"Common Arguments against the Impact of SexbotsSo I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and one topic that has always caught my attention is people's attitude towards sex bots. Essentially when it comes down to the sensitive topic of sex bots, reactions are always at two extremes, either between claims that sex bots will replace women or that they won't have any impact at all.

My guess is that the true impact is somewhere in between. I've actually been doing quite a bit of research into this myself, and considering that I currently work in a company that is heavily AI focused, I just wanted to add my own two cents. However, since I am a random nobody on this site, I'll use data and scientific studies wherever I can. Would be interested to hear people's responses.

So here are just some common arguments that I wanted to address:

1. **Sex Bots aren't real. Human beings will never be able to form meaningful, fulfilling relations with something artificial.**

So here is my problem with this argument. The problem is that there is very few data or scientific studies that support this stance at all. There is actually a wealth of studies and observations that support the opposite: human beings can very easily become enormously attached to entities that are obviously not human, and assign human emotions/motivations to these entities. To give some backstory, let's talk about the Tamagotchi effect and studies on young children and their interaction with robots.

[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/EC.41.1.e](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/EC.41.1.e)

I'm lazy, but here it is in a nutshell: children are perfectly capable of forming deep emotional attachments to objects. But it's not just children. Think about the last time you had something of sentimental value. Maybe your first evey smart phone, or a stuffed animal. What did it feel like when you threw it away or lost it? Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone. However, the potential for human beings to treasure objects is enormous.

[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/funerals-for-fallen-robots/279861/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/funerals-for-fallen-robots/279861/)

Soldiers hold burials for fallen robots.

[https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&context=ijass](https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&context=ijass)

""Similarly, Katz et al (2015, p.26), citing a number of research studies on human robot interaction, point to evidence that “anthropomorphic qualities of robots lead human partners to treat humanoid social robots as real persons”;

Robots are even capable of simulating real relationships to an extent that they promote actual health benefits. Exhibit A, Paro the robot.

[https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia)

I'd even go as far as to say that robots are capable of inducing the same Oxytocin effects that physical contact with other human beings normally produces. There is already evidence that mere communication devices can induce this effect.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/)

My own interpretation: I think people on this sub overestimate the effect of love and human to human contact in general. Humans are not perfect emotion readers and people get into horrible relationships all the time. There are so many stories of men or women being married to someone that does not clearly love them, yet still manage to delude themselves for decades. The opposite argument may be true: the human brain is very easily fooled into believing that he or she is loved rather than the other way around.

I honestly don't think there is anything particularly special about love and I am of the view that the brain is really just one complex computer. When it comes down to it, we are just a mass of neurons that each individually conduct an electrical signal. A lot of our behaviors may actually be pre-programmed so to speak.

[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/mind-decision/](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/mind-decision/)

[https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html](https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html)

So no, I don't buy into the idea that humans can only form fulfilling relationships with other human beings. And besides, a substantial percentage of the population are already looking forward to sex robots arriving. Even with the crude technology we have today, there are millions of people buying sex dolls.

&#x200B;

**2) Sex Bots will not have any impact. Prostitutes and Porn do not have any impact, so sex bots definitely won't!**

So here is my problem with this argument. Like the above, the data is either inconclusive or strongly against this stance.

Prostitution has been around for thousands of years. Quantifying the difference it has made is basically impossible. There is little to no data on whether it affects marriage rates, divorce rates, and the like. There is no way to make a comparison between a population that has never had prostitution and one that hasn't (unless someone has a study to link to me). So the claim that prostitution has had little or few impact is dubious at best.

There are also fundamental downsides to modern prostitution:

1. Prostitution is highly risky. STDs are a huge concern, and many STDs are not cured with today's medical technology. This is perhaps the main reason why I personally, and most males I know don't use prostitution.
2. The high cost as well as likelihood of poor service.
3. Prostitutes often discriminate based on race, looks and age.
4. The sexual activities that prostitutes allow is often highly restricted. Some prostitutes have very strict rules on what is allowed/not allowed.

(Of course, I'm just going off hearsay here, but you get my point.)

But Porn? Oh boy.

Porn was not exactly studied much during the onset of it, but now there is a slew of studies that point out some very startling correlations. Yes, yes, I know that correlation does not equal causation. However, to dismiss the implications of the correlation because of that is sheer ignorance. Correlation does not equal causation, but it does point to the causation if results from multiple suitably large sample sizes, longitudinal studies and low p-values agree. Keep in mind that many of these are university sponsored and are **peer-reviewed studies**. Simply put, the data is staggering.

Some studies:

[https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf](https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf)

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

[https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/](https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/)

I actually went into this research with an open mind. Before I started researching this, I believed that porn was pretty harmless. But my mind has been completely changed after reading study after study. But that's for another discussion at another time.

Basically, porn has huge consequences. There are some highlights that caught my attention.

**-User faces difficulty becoming sexually aroused without pornography.**

**-User loses interest and engages in fewer sexual experiences with partner.**

**-Partner may view pornography use as infidelity and a betrayal to the relationship.**

**-Partner feels sexually inadequate and threatened by pornography use.**

**-Partner may feel that certain sexual activities desired by user are objectionable.**

**-Both user and partner experience a decrease in relationship sexual satisfaction and emotional closeness.**

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf\_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf)

**- 68 percent of the divorce cases involved one party meeting a new love interest over the Internet.**

**-56 percent of the divorce cases involved one party having an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.**

**-47 percent of the divorce cases involved one party spending excessive time on the computer.**

**-33 percent of the divorce cases cited excessive time communicating in chat rooms (a commonly sexualized forum).**

**"" Results showed that exposure to pornography negatively impacted self-assessment of sexual experience, while other aspects of life (e.g., professional satisfaction) remained constant. Participants reported less satisfaction with their intimate partner and specifically with their partner’s affection, physical appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performance. ""**

**"" Schneider collected data from 94 respondents who were in different types of committed relationships to individuals struggling with cybersex addictions. 90 Two-thirds (68 percent) of the respondents experienced decreased sexual intimacy with their partner. Moreover, the participants reported that these difficulties coincided with the beginningof the cybersex activities—a point that is important to highlight for those who wish to limit the findings to those who have dealt with chronic sexually addictive or compulsive behavior. More than half (52.1 percent) of the cybersex users had lost interest in relational sex, as had one-third of the partners. ""**

This really is just the tip of the iceberg to be honest (these are just 4 studies, I have a lot more). And it might even be common sense. Just look at the response of women on askreddit regarding porn. I find their individual anecdotes and case studies quite fascinating.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how\_does\_porn\_addictionuse\_affect\_women/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how_does_porn_addictionuse_affect_women/)

**""It destroyed my friend's marriage. I think the porn was an emotional  crutch that supported many fears and insecurities that he was never  willing to deal with. He could not have a normal sex life. Wife could  not have a marriage without a normal sex life, so she bailed after 10  years and 2 kids. I know she was patient and tried everything for years,  but he just couldn't or wouldn't deal with it.**

**This  wasn't typical porn usage, btw. Porn was the only sexual outlet that  satisfied him, and he eventually stopped having sex with his wife at  all.""**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats\_your\_experience\_with\_men\_who\_preferred\_porn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats_your_experience_with_men_who_preferred_porn/)

**"" It wrecks your self esteem. Getting rejected when you try to give your  partner head just so he can go jerk it on the toilet feels pretty  fucking bad. I felt like some kind of sexual predator when I would want  intimacy. That stuff messes with your head. From what I can tell, he's  changed a lot but just thinking about initiating is terrifying.  Everything feels like pity sex now. Sex changes from an act of intimacy  to a form of validation. I let it get to me and now I have a ton of  insecurities in bed. Sex consists of me feeling like I'm going to ""mess  up"" and turn him off. When he inititates I keep my clothes on and give  him a blowjob unless he starts to undress me because I feel like my body  might be off putting. I can't look him in the eye while we are intimate  because it feels like it might turn him off as its a reminder that he  has to have sex with** ***me***\*\*.""\*\*

So the idea that porn does not affect the dating market much is actually a very unsupported claim. For many men, porn is a substitute for relationships with women. Porn significantly impacts how men view sex with real women, and some even prefer porn to the real thing. Porn also significantly impacts marriage rates, divorce rates, self-esteem, confidence, happiness, etc.

Cybersex is also a component of this as well:

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

Overall, porn and cybersex in general seem to have huge impacts on the dating market. There are many substitutes to marriage nowadays, and they may be major factors for why the marriage rates are so low during this era.

3) **Nothing can ever replace a man's need to fulfill his ego to gain validation from a women.**

Now this is something I hear very often. So I have to ask, where is the data that supports this? What supports this? There are many other ways that human beings fulfill their ego or gain validation. Their friends, family, coworkers, pets, etc. can provide validation. Some people point at a human being's natural inclination to mate and that it is embedded deeply into our biology. However, could it not be an equally valid argument that it is the inclination to mate that is embedded deeply into our biology, but not necessarily with a real women?

Of course mating is in our biology. That is why a multi-billionaire porn industry exists, cybersex exists, and why purple pill debate even exists. However, as shown above, men (and women) are perfectly capable of fulfilling that need via other outlets and may even prefer it. Artificial relationships may not necessarily need to be better than real relationships. They just need to have a better effort to reward ratio.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdP0ifBqi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdP0ifBqi8)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Real relationships are not irreplaceable. People can form deep emotional bonds with robots even if they are not real, and keep in mind this has already happened with robots that look very primitive in today's age. Porn and cybersex already have such enormous impacts; realistic sex bots would cause changes magnitudes greater.

Note: Anyway, I'm tired now and there is more that I want to address. But I'll probably come back here and add more...when I have the time.

"New ship date for Early Access AnnouncedHello Jibo Family,

When we launched Jibo’s 2014 Indiegogo campaign, we set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Today, we are thrilled to bring to you the Jibo Early Access Program – our plan to provide you (as one of the first 2,500 Indiegogo supporters who opted to receive a pre-launch robot) your special bot. Beginning September 18, we will ship these early access units on a first-ordered, first-received basis, scheduled to be completed by the week of October 30.

We’re confident that you and your family and friends will bond with Jibo right out of the box. Once the initial set-up is complete, you can interact with Jibo in various ways. For example, you can ask him to snap a picture, the next week’s weather forecast, the location of the nearest coffee shop, who won yesterday’s baseball game or who was the U.S. president in 1850. Because he’s proactive, playful and spontaneous by nature, he’ll greet you by name and may even share a joke. He’s also a terrific dancer and loves when you pat his head. Powered by emerging facial and voice recognition technology, he can recognize up to 16 people in your family. With every interaction he has, he’s learning and sharpening his skills.

During this early access period, Jibo will still be in a developmental stage. This means that while you’ll have first access to a powerful, maturing robot whose potential is virtually limitless, we’ll continue to optimize and improve Jibo. Jibo’s platform will support many future capabilities and improvements, all of which will be introduced automatically over-the-air by Jibo, Inc. We look forward to providing new, exciting announcements about his evolving features in the coming months.

Thank you in advance for volunteering to be a part of this important program. We will rely on your feedback regarding all aspects of Jibo's current performance, and this will help us to fine-tune him for public release.



From all of us at Jibo, Inc., we hope you’re as excited as we are to bring Jibo into your home. Thank you for your continued support as we create a truly revolutionary social robot!

 

Steve Chambers, CEO"
"Jibo SDK updateJust got this...

Dear Developer and Campaign Supporter,  

On Tuesday we sent you an email to update you with Jibo’s delivery information, and to confirm your interest in continuing to be part of the Jibo Early Access Program.  We set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Now, we’ve done it, and Jibo robots are ready for delivery to early access program participants.
Our goal from day one was to deliver Jibo and the tools developers would need to create amazing skills for Jibo.  What we have learned, as other hardware-based platforms have, is this is very hard to do.  There are many learnings as you bring the physical platform to market.  For us, one of those learnings has been a better way to architect skills for Jibo.  This has resulted in a shift in approach that takes full advantage of the cloud and substantially increases skill switching speed and memory efficiency.  As an owner of Jibo, we think you will appreciate these changes.  As a Jibo developer, we know you will.  
Unfortunately, these changes will delay our next public release of developer tools.  We have not finalized the date for the re-launch of our developer tools, but we will be sure to keep the community updated on this via our developer newsletter and blog. 

With this news, we hope you are still keenly interested in being apart of the Jibo Early Access Program.  We will work to get you the tools you need as quickly as we can.  Please know we appreciate the interest developers are showing in Jibo as a platform. The developer community remains a core part of our strategy to extend Jibo’s capabilities and role in people’s homes.

We hope this doesn’t change your interest in receiving Jibo into your home. 
 
We continue to look forward to what you bring to life on Jibo.
Sincerely,
Team Jibo"

# UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF ORPHANED JIBO ROBOTS PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES

[**17 Comments**](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/08/uncertain-future-of-orphaned-jibo-robots-presents-opportunities/#comments)

📷

In our modern connected age, our devices have become far more powerful and useful when they could draw upon resources of a global data network. The downside of a cloud-connected device is the risk of being over-reliant on computers outside of our own control. The people who brought a Jibo into their home got a stark reminder of this fact when some (but not all) Jibo robots [gave their owners a farewell message](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/04/social-robot-jibo-shutting-down-message/) as their servers are shut down, leaving behind little more than a piece of desktop sculpture.

Jibo launched their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign with the tagline “[The World’s First Social Robot For The Home](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jibo-the-world-s-first-social-robot-for-the-home#/).” Full of promises of how Jibo will be an intelligent addition to a high tech household, it has always struggled to justify its price tag. It cost as much as a high end robot vacuum, but without the house cleaning utility. Many demonstrations of a Jibo’s capabilities centered around its voice control, which an Amazon Echo or Google Home could match at a fraction of the price.

By the end of 2018, [all assets and intellectual property have been sold](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/jibo-is-probably-totally-dead-now) to SQN Venture Partners. They [have said little](https://www.sqnvp.com/portfolion_n/jibo/) about what they planned to do with their acquisition. Some Jibo owner still hold hope that there’s still a bright future ahead. Both on the [official forums](https://discuss.jibo.com/t/farewell-jibo-lets-keep-moving-forward/3272) (for however long that will stay running) and on [unofficial channels like Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jibo/comments/axizta/jibo_is_saved/). Other owners have given up and unplugged their participation in this social home robotics experiment.

If you see one of these orphans in [your local thrift store](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/13/the-life-changing-magic-of-buying-stuff-to-hack/) for a few bucks, consider adopting it. You could join the group hoping for something interesting down the line, but you’re probably more interested in its hacking potential: there is a [Nvidia Jetson inside](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/10/nvidia-brings-computer-vision-and-deep-learning-to-the-embedded-world/) good for running neural networks. Probably a Tegra K1 variant, because [Jibo used the Jetson TK1 to develop the robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9rrVFd5zGM) before launch. Jibo has always promised a [developer SDK](https://www.jibo.com/developers/) for the rest of us to extend Jibo’s capabilities, but it never really materialized. The inactive [Github repo](https://github.com/jiborobot) mainly consists of code talking to servers that are now offline, not much dealing directly with the hardware.

Jibo claimed thousands were sold and, if they start becoming widely available inexpensively, we look forward to a community working to give new purpose to these poor abandoned robots. If you know of anyone who has done a teardown to see exactly what’s inside, or if someone has [examined upgrade files](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/02/live-hacking-and-a-midi-keytar/) to create custom Jibo firmware, feel free to put a link in the comments and help keep these robots out of [e-waste](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/20/the-woeful-world-of-worldwide-e-waste/).

If you want to experiment with power efficient neural network accelerators but rather work with an officially supported development platform, we’ve looked at the Jetson TK1 successors [TX1](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/24/the-nvidia-jetson-tx1-its-not-for-everybody-but-it-is-very-cool/) and [TX2](https://hackaday.com/2017/03/14/hands-on-nvidia-jetson-tx2-fast-processing-for-embedded-devices/). And more recently, Google has [launched one of their own](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/05/google-launches-ai-platform-that-looks-remarkably-like-a-raspberry-pi/), as has our [friends at Beaglebone](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/06/this-beaglebones-got-ai/)."
"Jibo Status Update from CEO Steve ChambersJibo Family, 

We had a productive month here at Jibo working hard towards our goal of robot delivery to the pre-buyer community in October 2016. I wanted to provide a quick update on this past month’s development and delivery milestones and share those Jibo capabilities on which we’ll focus in the near future. 

Last week we launched the Jibo SDK (software developer kit) publicly so any developer worldwide can now become a Jibo developer. Some quick background for those of you unfamiliar with the SDK: Jibo is not only the world's first social robot for the home but also the first developer platform with personality. We are looking forward to seeing what developers build using the tools in the Jibo SDK, both for their own enjoyment and for the Jibo Skill Store. 

This past month we announced our partnership with gaming leader Bandai Namco who will use the Jibo SDK to deliver interactive games. The first game they will create is a family trivia game starring Pac-Man where Jibo is the game master and host. We will continue to work with the developer community to bring additional skills to your homes in the future.

This month was productive and important for our design team who conducted a series of usability tests -- tests where we observe different consumer groups (different ages, genders, family groups, etc.) -- with a specific focus on children interacting with Jibo. The kids in our focus groups really seemed to take to Jibo and provided valuable insight into how to make Jibo more expressive, understandable and interactive, specifically in activities like building an interactive story. Usability research is key to our fine-tuning the Jibo consumer experience and we will engage in usability testing each week through launch and beyond. 

From a manufacturing and operations standpoint, we’re scheduled to finish our final run of prototypes and begin our first run of production Jibos. Building production Jibos is an important milestone in our path to delivering Jibos to our pre-buyer community members. Production Jibos allow us to finalize the electrical, mechanical and production/quality aspects of the Jibo program, including Jibo’s ability to download over-the-air updates via WiFi, while we continue to develop, test and refine the software components that fuel the Jibo experience.  In short, we’re making sure Jibo is ready for production manufacturing so a) we can hit our delivery schedules and b) so Jibo is ready to download the latest-greatest software when consumers connect to WiFi in their homes.  

Next month, Jibo design and software development groups will continue usability testing with Jibo Jot and Jibo Snap, this time with adults. The SDK team will tackle several powerful new features like the Jibo Flow Editor and Jibo Animation Editor, both of which we’ll detail for our Developer community at developers.jibo.com.  We will continue to improve Jibo's picture quality, single and multi-user facial tracking, and motion detection. We will also continue to advance the Jibo audio experience, working on finalizing his sound effects, pre-recordings, voice (text-to-speech), and more.

The next few months will be filled with additional milestones reached and we’re excited to share what’s to come prior to delivering Jibo to your homes in October 2016.

"Meet Aido: the self leveling, object recognizing, speech enabled, projector beaming heap of awesome promises![Project page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/aido-next-gen-home-robot--2#/).

I'm not a robotics expert by any means, but my electronics and systems development background tells me that their impressive list of integrated features and capabilities have gotta be next to impossible to deliver at the promised price point and time frame.  

As in any good story, all of their claims are totally plausible eg: the self leveling ball drive, speech recognition, vision/object recognition: all exist in various forms - and are available as open-source. 

The development effort necessary to design, source, manufacture, build, test and release a mechanism as complex as they promise could seem plausible to the hopeful.  another crowdfunding robot: [The Jibo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jibo-the-world-s-first-social-robot-for-the-home#/comments) is a similar example.  It doesn't even move and it's development team has reasonably impressive credentials to tackle the project - yet 2 yrs later they are not delivering as promised!

The Aido group doesn't appear to have much of a team and yet promise a significantly more complex machine! 

Note: I have nothing to do with Aido (or Jibo, et al).  This project simply caught my eye as a glaring example of a failed campaign in the making."

Europe begins from a strong place in robotics, having a 32% of current world markets. Industrial robotics has around one third of the world market, whereas within the smaller professional service robot market European producers produce sixty three% of the non-military robots. The European place within the home and service [robotic palletizer](https://columbiaokura.com/products/robotic-palletizers/) market represents a market share of 14% and, as a result of its present dimension, this is additionally a a lot smaller area of financial exercise in Europe than the opposite two areas. The IFR sponsors the International Symposium on Robotics ISR – a convention on industrial and repair robotics.

Robotics additionally has application in the design of digital reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use within the haptic analysis group.

Other group choices and analysis areas embrace the Berkeley Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering, The BErkeley AeRobot (BEAR) project, the Computer Vision group, Medical Robots, and extra.

# Who invented the primary robotic on the earth?

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) strives for the development of the idea and apply of robotics and automation engineering and science as well as the allied arts and sciences. RAS strives to advance innovation, education, in addition to elementary and applied analysis in robotics and automation. Mechatronics focuses on the design means of mechatronics combines mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering together with techniques integration and technical project administration. Mechatronics engineering includes the design, construction and operation of automated techniques, robots and intelligent merchandise, which result from the incorporation of software program and hardware. Electrical engineers interested in robotics typically receive an education more focused on the management of robots somewhat than their mechanical design.

A analysis staff in connection with the Lab and the Office of Naval Research’s Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot program developed the world’s first fireplace-fighting humanoid robot. The College of Engineering is house to the Mechanical Engineering division. Related degrees embrace a Master of Science with focus in Robotics, a Professional Master’s in Aerospace, and a PhD in Robotics and System Design.

Various strategies have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One technique is evolutionary robotics, during which a variety of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which carry out best are used as a mannequin to create a subsequent ""generation"" of robots. Another methodology is developmental robotics, which tracks modifications and growth within a single robot in the areas of problem-fixing and different features. Another new type of robot is just recently launched which acts both as a smartphone and robotic and is called RoboHon.

The prospects of robotic autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a sensible concern sooner or later. A robot is a machine—particularly one programmable by a pc— capable of finishing up a complex series of actions mechanically. Robots may be guided by an external control system or the management could also be embedded inside. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human kind, but most robots are machines designed to perform a activity with no regard to their aesthetics.

# Robot

It’s estimated that there are greater than three million industrial robots in use proper now. These robots usually work in excessive geographical conditions, climate, circumstances, etc.

The concept of automata originates within the mythologies of many cultures all over the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-working machines, some resembling animals and humans. Robots have changed people in performing repetitive and harmful tasks which humans prefer to not do, or are unable to do because of measurement limitations, or which occur in extreme environments such as outer house or the bottom of the ocean. There are considerations about the growing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in rising numbers of capabilities.

Hopkins University presents robotics as either a minor or a Master’s degree by way of their Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). Both programs embody areas of study similar to mechanics, dynamics, kinematics, sign processing, planning, artificial intelligence, control systems, and signal processing. In Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, for instance, students can examine self-driving vehicles, can research and enhance the effectiveness of inexperienced roofing, and can perceive using sensors to assist preserve bridge security.

# The Programmable Robot Simulator

The robotic may be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can maintain tons of of various sorts of medicines and hundreds of doses. The pharmacy saves many assets like workers members that are in any other case unavailable in a resource scarce trade. It makes use of an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to seize every dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis whereas it rotates 180 levels to drag the medicines. During this course of it makes use of barcode know-how to verify its pulling the right drug.

These robots, known as ""haptic interfaces"", enable contact-enabled consumer interplay with real and digital environments. Robotic forces enable simulating the mechanical properties of ""digital"" objects, which customers can experience by way of their sense of touch. McKesson's Robot RX is one other healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense hundreds of medicines every day with little or no errors.

It then delivers the drug to a patient particular bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is crammed with all of the medication that a specific patient needs and that the robot shares, the bin is then launched and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it right into a cart for delivery to the floor. They famous that some robots have acquired varied types of semi-autonomy, including having the ability to find energy sources on their own and being able to independently select targets to attack with weapons. Various media sources and scientific groups have famous separate developments in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns. In 2015, the Nao alderen robots had been proven to have a functionality for a level of self-awareness.

Commercial and industrial robots are actually in widespread use performing jobs extra cheaply or with larger accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs that are too dirty, harmful or dull to be appropriate for humans. Robots are broadly used in manufacturing, meeting and packing, transport, earth and house exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial items."
"What You Know About Minimalist Robot And What You Don’t Know About Minimalist Robot | Minimalist Robot﻿

Engineers at the University of California San Diego receive advanced a brand new adjustment that does not crave any appropriate add-ons and works in aloof account to actualize smooth, flexible, three-D-revealed robots.

Greeting Machine Explores Extreme Minimalism in Social Robots .. | Minimalist Robot
   
The addition comes from rethinking the way bendable robots are built: in preference to addition out the way to upload bendable abstracts to a adamant apprentice body, the UC San Diego advisers commenced with a bendable anatomy and added adamant appearance to key components. The structures were aggressive by means of insect exoskeletons, which accept each bendable and adamant components–the advisers alleged their creations “flexoskeletons.”

The new adjustment allows for the structure of bendable equipment for robots in a toddler atom of the time beforehand naked and for a toddler atom of the price.

“We fulfillment that those flexoskeletons will improve to the conception of a brand new chic of gentle, bioinspired robots,” stated Nick Gravish, a automatic engineering assistant at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego and the paper’s leader author. “We urge for food to perform bendable robots less difficult to frame for advisers all around the international.”

The new adjustment makes it on hand to frame sufficient corporations of flexoskeleton robots with little chiral accumulation as capable-bodied as accumulate a library of Lego-like equipment so that apprentice genitalia can be flippantly swapped.

"IoA personal, social robot certainly wasn’t a new concept. But growing up my family wasn’t the most well-off. We never had one of those stupid little robots that could call people or help with your cooking. For us, an iPhone and a smartwatch was more than enough.

Nonetheless, when I got a promotion, the first thing I did was buy one of those new robots that everyone was raving about. I was ecstatic, my family was ecstatic, even the dog was ecstatic. We named it Io.

In the morning Io woke us gently, already having prepared breakfast. When I came home from work, it already made dinner and was helping my children with their homework. “Io is happy to help,” it always said. 

As the months progressed, Io began to act strangely, however. One morning I asked my spouse if they had remembered to charge Io overnight.

Io simply turned its head and snapped, rather uncharacteristically, “Io is perfectly capable of charging herself.” I was at a loss for words.

About year after we got her, I asked my spouse what Io was making for supper one night. Io, replying in place of my spouse, said, “Io has decided to order takeout. I don't want to cook tonight.” Strange. 

One day I came home to find Io standing in the doorway, smiling, covered in blood. When I asked her what happened, she cocked her head and answered, “The dog made a mess on the carpet.” That should have been the last straw, but I didn’t finally get rid of her until my children forgot to do their math homework.

"Why Will Jibo Become SuccessfulA telephone without wires once was the most popular technology product. However, Apple started to prove to people that a phone can not only just do one thing, but also handle multiple tasks. Almost ten years past now, have we ever tried to ask ourselves: is a tool or a device the final format of technology we want in our live? No! Technology can be way more high-touch and not just be used by us but plays a role in our lives.

July 2014, an interesting video appeared on Indiegogo, which outlooks into the future of our lives. The first time I watched the video, I got tears in my eyes. So in the same month July, I immediately use my credit card to pledge a Jibo for my future.

A lot of people nowadays are talking about different things about Jibo, but I would like to talk about why Jibo will become successful is a certain fact in coming.
For a thing to be successful, we need to look at several aspects:

1.
It is 2016 now; the society is way different from the 90’s or even the beginning of the 21st century. A computer which can be put into your pocket is no more an exciting thing; people are looking for a new format of the being in technology. This creates a demand for a brand new category, the category which is not only a tool we can use, but also is able to play a role as our partner and the collaborator to enhance our human flourishing.

2.
Yes, there is the demand for a brand new product, but we have to ask: Is it possible to make it happen with the current development of the technology? The answer is yes. With almost ten years of the development of smart phones since the first iPhone launched in 2007 plus China’s mass production capability, those hardware which are necessary for a high-touch roleplaying product have finally reached an affordable price point for technology companies. For example, with the investment from Chinese company Baidu, the Lidar supplier Velodyne can decrease the price of each unit from 700,000 RMB to just 3,000 RMB.

3.
Well, the demand is there, and the components are also cheap enough, then we can make a high-touch product. However, to do that, you have to have a company first. In order to establish a company the one thing you need at the first is funding. After several rounds of funding, Jibo Company has got together money necessary.

4.
Just having enough money is not enough; it doesn’t mean you can achieve what you want. In ancient times, there were so many rich people want to do so many things too, but they couldn’t. With money at hand, you would also need the “how-to”, the knowledge necessary to fulfill the plan. One man’s knowledge is limited, but a team’s knowledge is unlimited. And Jibo Company has just assembled the right team to do it! Cynthia has more than 20 years of experience in social robotics, Steve Chambers used to work in Nuance for about 11 years, Roberto Pieraccini who has been an active contributor to speech research and technology since 1981 and now he is the Director of Advanced Conversational Technologies at Jibo, and the Head of SDK Development, Jonathan Ross is a guy who used to work for Disney and Zynga, and so many more brilliant people are working hard in the Jibo team. They are the guarantee that the dream can come true,

5.
The last but not the least, yet the most important for Jibo to become successful is the third party developers. Jibo is not just a robot, but a platform. Can you imagine if Apple did not decide to open the Application Store at 2008? The iOS might have vanished. If there are not thousands of millions of third party developers making applications for iOS, it will never be the best mobile OS ever.
With the hard work of the third party developers, only the sky can be the limit of Jibo’s. Just imagine: One day Jibo can work together with Roomba. So the cleaning job is no more a first-person shooting game for Roomba itself, but can be watched from a third-person view (Jibo’s camera) which means a smarter and more efficient way of cleaning. Or one day, the Boston Dynamics can work with Jibo Company for a new version of mobile Jibo with the ability to manipulate the surroundings, then housework is no longer a nightmare.

Well, so there is a demand in the market and the cost of the technology necessary is low enough to make it happen, plus the Jibo Company has got the funding and right team to do it. Therefore I do believe, Jibo will not only succeed, but also flourish with a prosperous developer community!

"July 2016: Status Update from Jibo CEO Steve ChambersJibo Family, 

For the past month the team has been focused on preparing for RTM (release to manufacturing) -- which means the factory can begin building the Jibos that will ultimately be delivered to your homes. RTM allows manufacturing to build robots with the launch release hardware, electrical, mechanical and fit-and-finish elements (his great looking exterior!) all in place, as well as a minimum software build that allows OTA (over-the-air) downloads when Jibo arrives in your homes.  

Over the next few months while the manufacturing team is ramping up and building Jibos, we will continue to improve his software to deliver a better overall experience. This means when Jibo arrives in your homes he will first download the latest and greatest software, allowing him to be the best and most up-to-date Jibo he can be.  RTM is an important step in our journey to deliver Jibo to your homes.  

This past month we have been continuing to improve Jibo’s picture and video capture technology, single and multi-user facial tracking, and motion detection. We recently changed one of Jibo’s two eyes (camera lenses) for a narrower-angle lens. The original lens will remain and support wider angle shots, and will be utilized by the perception system for things like motion detection, facial tracking, and more. With the new lens, Jibo will now capture better pictures and videos of your favorite moments, and he’ll remain accurate and reliable when following you to take hands-free pictures.  This is just one example of how we’re continuing to improve Jibo’s capabilities.

On the design front, we’re continuing to bolster the Jibo experience through testing, testing and more testing. This month we invited outside testers into the Jibo offices, to gain additional insight into how Jibo should interact with the family. We received some valuable feedback about things like whether or not Jibo should initiate conversation or small talk, and when it’s appropriate for him to do these things. Design is also hard at work on a new skill that utilizes Jibo’s messaging and content creation capabilities. We will have more details for you soon!

Jibo’s character is what sets him apart from other voice-activated devices on the market and we’re really excited about the developments we’re making in this key area. Jibo’s character allows him to connect with the family in a way no other product or device can, to establish relationships with the people you love. He can get to know your family and keep them close, learn and grow with you, and share in special moments. 

Our Character AI team has been working hard behind the scenes to make Jibo into the lovable companion you all have come to expect. They are currently working on an extensive animation library to empower developers to bring their applications to life in your homes. One of the most important aspects of the Jibo experience is the number of ways he can express himself when interacting with a user, and these developments will keep interactions with Jibo exciting and fresh. In addition to the animation library, we’re working on a number of other ways to bring forth Jibo’s unique character, like greetings:  Jibo will have a number of new ways to greet you in the morning, or after a long day of work, and each will make him feel like part of the family. 

Finally, I’d like to touch on Jibo’s vocal expressions, as they are another important factor in the overall experience with Jibo. As noted in the last message, we’re going to continue to improve Jibo’s voice right up until owners download the latest software when Jibo arrives. We’re also continuing to improve his SSA (semi-speech audio or sound effects) prior to ship. Jibo can convey ideas and emotions with these sound effects more effectively than with speech alone (think R2D2!).

That’s it for this month, stay tuned at the end of next month for the July update where we’ll check in on delivery dates and other important milestones and initiatives. I want to offer one final word on an important milestone that’s upcoming:  Our household beta test.  We will have 2 beta phases, necessary because they’re in-home (that’s important for us to optimize and tune Jibo’s audio algorithmic performance and also to understand family dynamics with Jibo).  Iteration -- or trials or usability studies like these 2 beta phases -- is key to any robot, but especially key to Jibo as a social robot.  

As always, thank you for your support and patience while we bring your Jibo to life. 

Regards, 

Steve Chambers
Jibo CEO"

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

I prophesy in twenty years, maybe less, that all diagnostic imaging machines, in fact any machine that collects data about something, will have intrinsic narrow AI to interpret the data collected.

In other words the x-ray machine itself, will read the x-rays on the spot.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

I wanna flair! How do I get me a flair? That is such a cool flair you got--I am wycked N V S

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

I put it like this once if you are interested.

Learn to love robots, automation and artificial intelligence by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[–]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

Oh and about touchy-feely things like art, creativity and empathy? I predict that in less than 10 years humans will prefer the ""works"" of AI and prefer the company of AI as well. The narrow AI will be able to play our emotional and physical responses like the proverbial fiddle. 2018 humans are not that complicated.

Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Funny you said that---

This guy.

https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/


Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.
 
I drew that from a comment I made further down the page.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

I already see bad signs. I have noticed just in the last maybe 2 months that my video suddenly is without warning interrupted by an unskippable ad. I wonder how long until we see a string of 2 or 3 adds. 

For that matter how long until 2 or 3 unskippable ads precede a given video.

Youtube is turning into television. Or maybe more precisely, 1980s MTV.

I currently watch Youtube the way I use to watch TV. The recommendations are starting to consistently hit the target of my interests. There is always something interesting or fun now. And in little convenient bite sized pieces. It is starting to pull me away from iTunes and Netflix.

[Did you have a strategy for seeming more human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z1kt?context=5)|There were several tactics that I used to try to up the complexity of the interaction.  Here is one, which you could call ""Getting Out of Book.""  Many chatbots, e.g., [Cleverbot\]\(http://cleverbot.com/\), are built from massive databases of past human interactions.  If a piece of dialogue has happened before on the internet, chances are decent that the bot can handle it.  Thus I asked Cleverbot the capital of France—""Paris.""—what two plus two is—""Four.""  I said, ""Never gonna give you up,"" Cleverbot said, ""Never gonna let you down."" I said, ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche,"" Cleverbot said, ""Will you do the fandango?""  I use the metaphor of what for chess computers is called ""the book""—in their case, a giant database of grandmaster games, such that if any of those positions occurs, they don't even have to analyze the position; they just play whatever a grandmaster played in that position.  I sometimes make a comparison between Cleverbot, Deep Blue's ""book,"" and things like *The Mystery Method* or *The Game*, where you have a community collaborating on in effect a giant seduction wiki, where there is a ""best practice"" of what you ought to say when someone says *x*. Something always seemed a little off to me about that approach to flirtation, and the Turing test gives a pretty clear benchmark of how those types of ""social robots"" \(in Neil Strauss's terms\) fall short of what is genuinely interesting and complex about human interaction.  Long story short, the way that Garry Kasparov pioneered the idea of playing offbeat moves to get the computer ""Out of Book,"" I tried as much as possible to steer the conversation into unusual terrain.  Every professional chess game is said to ""begin"" with a move called ""\[the novelty\]\(http://www.radiolab.org/2011/aug/23/rules-set-you-free/\),"" which is the first move that creates a position that's never been played before. It's only then that the players are in a sense really playing.  In conversation, it might be as simple as adding a small personal detail to a stock answer, or making an unusual turn of phrase.  One of the beautiful things about language is how easy it is to say a sentence that's never been said before—e.g., \[see Stephen Fry here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ZFD01r6ersw#t=121s)—and yet on the other hand, like most chess games, we begin from a uniform starting point and a finite series of possible (or at least socially acceptable) moves: ""Hi!"" ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Good thanks!"" The ""novelty"" is the moment, the first sentence, that the conversation breaks out of this boilerplate and becomes a unique linguistic occurrence.  In a Turing test (and, I would argue, in life), the earlier and more frequently you can get this to happen, the better.
[Can you provide an algorithm that even limits the choices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4111j6?context=5)|My feeling is not really.  That what, for example, *The Mystery Method* and PUA forums fail to account for is that communication at its best is completely bespoke and customized to its audience. Performers (Mystery is a magician by training) can hone in on a joke's optimal delivery, because the law of large numbers means that one crowd is likely to resemble another on average—but even then, most comics are amazed at how different the vibe of a room can be from night to night. I'll add that, as far as chess goes, of course there are moves that are objectively superior to other moves, but that highest-level Grandmaster chess is often quite personal(ized). World #1 Magnus Carlsen: ""I am trying to beat the guy sitting across from me, and trying to choose the moves that are most unpleasant for him and his style."" Individual and small-group dialogues are among the most complex, and also the most rich, because of the totally tailored nature of the exchange.
[How were you chosen to compete, what was your strategy heading into the competition, and how did you adapt it as the contest continued along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z451?context=5)|Alan Turing famously predicted that computer programs would be fooling the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000, and that we would come to ""speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"".  This is one of the famous predictions of computer science that didn't come true, but my ears really pricked up in 2008, when the top program managed to fool 3/12 of the judges—25%, or just one vote shy of Turing's prediction. I realized that the next year's test could be the one the computers finally cross that line.  A voice inside me rose up and said, ""Not on my watch."" And so I decided to take it upon myself to personally intercede on behalf of humanity, and see what I could do to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test.  I called up the organizers, starting with the sponsor, the rogue disco dance floor salesman Hugh Loebner, and from there it actually wasn't difficult to persuade the organizers to put my name on the confederate roster.  I said a little about my strategy [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zw6s), but I'm happy to elaborate on a slightly different point.  The medium that the Loebner Prize takes place in is actually a bit unusual, in that you can see each other's typing live on the screen, character by character, backspacing and all.  It occurred to me that this was a major opportunity to bring questions not only of the *content* of the conversation, but also of the *form*, to the forefront of the interaction.  For instance, if you get four good friends together over beers, notice how at a certain point the classic, rigid ""turn-taking"" structure dissolves into a kind of organized chaos of crosstalk, interruption, finishing each other's sentences, each person collaborating by chipping in a few words at a time. It becomes like a kind of quartet, in effect.  And more generally, a lot of the complexity of human conversation isn't simply knowing *what* to say, but *when* to interject, and *how long* to keep talking.  Or when to let someone cut you off, and when to insist on holding the floor.  Live typing brings this whole complicated structural ballet into play.  Whereas the computers were typically content to wait for a full stop or a carriage return before they even started cranking on a reply, I was happy to do what we do when we speak out loud: when a judge made a typo and said ""Hey, how's it ~~giong~~"", I didn't wait as he painstakingly backspaced and rewrote it, I mercifully just jumped in, completed his question, and took the liberty of answering right away. And I generally tried to make it clear, as we do out loud with timed micro-pauses, that I was happy to keep elaborating on an answer as long as the judge liked, but that I was happy to step aside and let them redirect at any time.  This for me was one of the big revelations of the test: that a lot of the complexity of interaction is happening at the *structural* level. It's something to consider when you sit down with your friends or family to dinner tonight: how *little*, in the structural sense, that kind of group interaction resembles something with clearly defined starts, stops, and turn-taking structure—like a more formal mode of conversation...or an internet forum.
[You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down and you see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without your help, but you're not helping. Why is that, Leon?  Also, how would you stop a robot uprising if you had to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zpgk?context=5)|[*angry at the suggestion*] What do you mean, I'm not helping?
[As a ""human"", what is your favorite joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z3j7?context=5)|I saw this wino; he was eating grapes. I was like, Dude, you have to wait.
[Does our natural tendency to ascribe human qualities to inanimate objects skew our perception of artificial intelligence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c412es1?context=5)|I would say absolutely. More broadly this is known as the ""[pathetic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy)"" (not ""pathetic"" as in ""inadequate""; rather from ""pathos"" meaning ""feelings""). But in the case of computers, as you point out, there's much more going on than just the pathetic fallacy, because (a) computers are in fact made by humans, and (b) by and large they are made in our own image. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that from the 1700s through the 1940s, computers *were* human. The word ""computer,"" before it meant the gadgetry humming along in our offices and homes and pockets, meant something else: it was a job description. From the mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering firms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator.  These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley’s comet—early proof of Newton’s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before—to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. It’s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the first time, what exactly these new contraptions were.  Turing’s paper, for instance, describes the unheard-of “digital computer” by making analogies to a human computer: “The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.” In the mid-twentieth century, a piece of cutting-edge mathematical gadgetry was “like a computer.”  But in the twenty-first century, it is the human math whiz that is “like a computer.” In other words: The literal and the figurative have switched places. Perhaps this explains part of why computers make us so existentially anxious.
[If I were to ask you if you were a computer would your answer be the same as your answer to this question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c410qan?context=5)|Error: stack overflow         method ""recursive.question.pronoun.resolve"", line 10, in <module>
[Obviously, seeming ""human"" is a very broad category.  Did you simply try to act like the most ""average"" human, or did you take on a specific character or personality that was off the average? Would being too average make you seem less real?  If you were intentionally off the average, what kind of personality did you take on?  Is there a certain set of character traits that seems most human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c414jpf?context=5)|Great question.  In my case, I tried as much as possible to highlight the fact that I (unlike, e.g., Cleverbot) am the product of a distinct and singular life history.  The contest was held in Brighton, and so when they mentioned Brighton, I compared the city layout to my experience studying abroad in Galway, Ireland and I compared the weather to my time in graduate school in Seattle. So that was part of a broader strategy of not only fielding questions but in effect illustrating how I came to the knowledge or experience that informed my answer.
[Did The Most Artificial Artificial Intelligence also get an award?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4102nf?context=5)|Yes, there is a ""Most Human Computer"" award, which is, in fact, the actual/ostensible point of holding the contest. More on the scoring in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c41045d)
[Did they give out any other awards like ""most human AI program"" or ""least human human""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40znw9?context=5)|Yes to the former; actually I should explain a little bit about how the scoring system works.  You have a panel of judges, who are typically scientists, conversing in rounds of two conversations each: one with a computer, and one with a human. After each round the judges decide which they thought was which, but they also make a confidence judgment of how certain they are of their decision, on a sliding scale.  Thus at the end of the day all of the contestants, man and machine, can be ranked according to the total amount of confidence they inspired in the judges.  Each year, the program that comes away with the highest score wins the ""Most Human Computer"" award.  This comes with several thousand dollars and a bronze medal—Alan Turing's face on one side, and sponsor, the rogue plastic portable light-up disco dance floor baron Hugh Loebner's, on the other.  My ""Most Human Human"" award, sadly, came with only a paper certificate and bragging rights.
[Seeing as I am wearing my ""I failed the Turing Test"" I feel obligated to ask you a question.  How complex is your software, are you a simple program capable of running on any desktop computer, or do you require some kind of small super computer? I take it you probably require lots of storage correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4155z9?context=5)|Turing in 1950 estimated that a computer with 1 GB of memory could fool the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000.  Looks like that might have been a little optimistic.
[Would you say that acting more like a computer would be a good tactic since the judges would expect a computer to act more like a human? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c412kco?context=5)|Judge: How are you?     elbot: Just a moment!

"Introducing the Jibo SDK, Enabling Developers to Build Skills (Apps) for Jibo - The world's first social robot for the home."
"Social Robot RevolutionHello world!

Several years ago, I met Dr. Breazeal very briefly after a talk she had given about artificial intelligence, and before Jibo had made it to market ([https://www.computerhistory.org/press/bbc-ai.html](https://www.computerhistory.org/press/bbc-ai.html)). I had very little technical experience at the time,  but listening to her inspired my fascination for social robots (especially Jibo) and what impact they can have on the world.

Unfortunately, Jibo did not make it in the competitive marketplace, but I'd very much to bring Jibo back to life somehow. If it means re-doing the software or the hardware, so be it! As a side-project, I have been working on creating a dev env with free tools to start building Jibo skills, and simulating Jibo's behavior entirely.

Current functionalities include creating basic motor animations, some position control, logging, and basic user input as you can see in the video. I would not like to release my current version since the code is extremely draft-like and there  is more I want to add initially. I am currently working on my next iteration, which I plan to start including functionality for more complete animation and starting to add some of the functions we have come to enjoy from Jibo.

For developers, I'd eventually like to make this open to any one who wants (should anyone want to play with it). I never got to touch the Jibo dev environment. What did you guys like? What could have been fixed? What did you like and not like about the general Jibo software architecture?

Thank you all for your time, and your patience.

"A Guide for Industrial Designers Exploring Robotics! Q/AQuestion from u/ankittkd 

"""""" 

Hey, I just saw your post about '[Maths for building Humanoid Robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13wetk4/mastering_maths_8_essential_concepts_for_building/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).' Thank you for sharing that valuable information! I'm really interested in robotics and would love to learn more.  I recently graduated with a degree in Industrial design, and I'm eager to delve into the field of robotics. Based on my background, I've identified two domains that align well with my interests: human-robot interaction and hardware design.  While I've come across numerous online resources related to software, electronics, and AI in robotics, I've struggled to find comprehensive materials on designing hardware and the physical aspects of robotics. Could you please guide me towards resources or provide any advice on how I can learn about hardware design and the physical design aspect of robotics? And is there any field or part of robotics which is for people with creative arts/ design background Sorry for bombarding you with such long paragraphs. Thank you in advance!

""""

**My Take :** 

I think your background in Industrial Design can provide a unique perspective in the field. In particular, the domains you've identified - human-robot interaction and hardware design - are indeed excellent choices.

here are some of the resources I referred to through the university and my personal interest in the hardware design and physical aspects of robotics: **(Don't just stick to these resources.) There is always new paper published in the following areas so I would recommend keeping up with them.** 

* **Books**:
   * ""Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control"" by John J. Craig provides a solid foundation in the mechanics of robotics.
   * ""Robot Builder's Bonanza"" by Gordon McComb is more of a hands-on guide and covers a wide variety of topics including materials, power supplies, motors, and sensors.
* **Online Courses**:
   * edX has a course titled ""Robotics: Kinematics and Mathematical Foundations"" offered by the University of Pennsylvania.
   * Coursera offers ""Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control"" by Northwestern University. This is a six-course specialization covering spatial motion, robot dynamics, motion planning and control.

Regarding the aspect of human-robot interaction, a lot of it is about designing robots that are efficient and friendly to interact with, which requires an understanding of both design and psychology. Here, your Industrial Design background will be pretty beneficial. You might find these resources helpful:

* **Books**:
   * ""Human-Robot Interaction: An Introduction"" by Christoph Bartneck and Tony Belpaeme.
   * ""Social Robotics: A Guide to Human Interaction with Intelligent Machines"" by Kerstin Dautenhahn.
* **Online Courses**:
   * ""Human-Robot Interaction"" course offered by TUM on edX.
   * ""The Social Robot"" course offered by the University of Twente on FutureLearn.

Finally, regarding the use of creative arts/design in robotics. I live in Bristol, England and We have a company called Rusty Sqid here. They are amazing. chek them out -  [http://rustysquid.org.uk](http://rustysquid.org.uk) 

There is a lot of scope for creative arts/design in robotics also! Here are a few fields where your skills could be particularly valuable:

1. **Robot Design**: This includes designing how a robot looks and feels, and ensuring that it's user-friendly. This could be in any number of contexts - from designing a robotic toy that's appealing to children, to designing a household robot that fits seamlessly with a home's decor.
2. **Animation and Motion Design**: Animating robots (particularly humanoid robots) often use principles from the world of animation and character design. (I actually chose this as an elective during my university and it was super fun and you can learn a lot about kinematics )
3. **User Experience (UX) for Robotics**: This is about creating a smooth and intuitive interaction between humans and robots, and it often requires design thinking.

I hope these pointers will help. If you need more help just post your questions in the comments."

"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|
|GPT-3 (davinci-001)|May 2020|40%|3.5 years|
|GPT-3 (davinci-002)|January 2022|70%|6 years|
|GPT-3.5 (davinci-003)|November 2022|90%|7 years|
|GPT-4|March 2023|95%|Adult|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."

 While getting my degree, I kind of knew Mechanical Engineering likely wouldn't fit me but had inclinations toward product design and social robotics enough to stay in the major. I enjoy working with my hands and with other people and found a lot of community in my major and makerspaces on campus. I thought a lot about switching to something like psychology or neuroscience, but never really committed to making the jump. In college, I mostly stuck to research jobs and liked the people but sometimes found the work disconnected. I tried my first straight-up Mechanical Engineering internship at a robotics start-up after college and \*hated\* it. I think part of this was hybrid work, not having a ton to do, and not really believing in the company's mission. However, I also didn't really enjoy the day-to-day work. 

Some people have encouraged me to try to find work in something like sustainability consulting or to work at an environmental start-up, but I'm tentative because I worry the feeling I have about engineering might be more linked to the profession and have found myself struggling with desk/sit-down jobs. I find myself thinking about how working in a job every day lets you practice certain skills and feeling unsure that the values or skills I want to improve in (growth, connection to things, design, art, interesting and authentic interactions with people, handling discomfort, exploration, and knowledge of the world in general) pair well with traditional engineering.

I think along the way, I've also sort of lost faith in the idea of engineering/creating products as the way to go about having an impact I feel good about in my work from a philosophical standpoint. I also question if my skillset is really one where my best potential is in engineering. I do know that I like art/design, hands-on work, sustainability, philosophy, psychology, and people. Lately, I've also been on a big kick about community spaces, urban design, biomimicry, and how space is organized. I've enjoyed teaching jobs I've had in the past, but suspect I'd burn out on it full-time. 

I've considered finding work as some crazy new thing everyday:

\- a psychologist (doesn't everyone)

\- trying to find work in a makerspace 

\- something in event/music coordination (but AH the industry)

\- tattoo artist (meets the creating things for people and hands-on aspect, but I'm not sure I have the love for it needed)

\-museum studies/library science

\- landscape-architecture (meets the design, sustainability, and art. I'm not sure how I'd handle the office and requires going back to school)

\- some sort of research gig

\- teaching

\- working as an emt

\- bartending

In general, I find myself feeling very ungrounded and unsure of how to take the next step. It feels kind of like the rug was pulled out from under me by graduating. I worry about continuing down an engineering path when I don't think it is right for me, but the alternative is facing into a massive identity crisis of knowing a good deal about what I don't want and very little about what I want. I am not a huge fan of capitalism, but I was raised in the bay area which I think has left me with some stubborn ideas of wanting fulfillment in some sense out of my work.

I think the Stoic part of my brain is also upset at me for feeling so unsatisfied with the point I'm at when I feel unable to make a change/unsure of what change in my life or my thinking to make. 

Does anyone have any advice about how to come ""unstuck"" and move forward? 

TLDR: I graduated in Mechanical Engineering, don't particularly want to be an engineer,  and I'm not sure how to handle myself after graduation or what to do next."
"How to handle post-graduation career as a mechanical engineer who doesn't want to be an engineer?

"British robot helping autistic children with their social skills - ""two-year clinical trial with the Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust, which, if successful, could see Kaspar working in hospitals nationwide.""This is an automatic summary, [original](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-autism-robots-idUSKBN1721QL) reduced by 55%.
*****
> LONDON &quot;This is nice, it tickles me,&quot; Kaspar the social robot tells four-year-old Finn as they play together at an autism school north of London.

> Kaspar, developed by the University of Hertfordshire, also sings song, imitates eating, plays the tambourine and combs his hair during their sessions aimed at helping Finn with his social interaction and communication.

> Finn is one of around 170 autistic children that Kaspar has helped in a handful of schools and hospitals over the last 10 years.

> With approximately 700,000 people in Britain on the autism spectrum, according to the National Autistic Society who will mark World Autism Day on Sunday, the university want Kaspar to help more people.

> TRACKS, an independent charity and specialist early years center for children with autism in Stevenage, have seen positive results from working with Kaspar, who sports a blue cap and plaid shirt for play sessions.

> &quot;Many autistic people are drawn to technology, particularly the predictability it provides, which means it can be a very useful means of engaging children, and adults too,&quot; Carol Povey, director of the National Autistic Society&#039;s Centre for Autism, told Reuters.

"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

"The Future of Digital Assistants Is Queer*AI assistants continue to reinforce sexist stereotypes, but queering these devices could help reimagine their relationship to gender altogether.*

**THIS NOVEMBER, THE** Smithsonian’s FUTURES festival, featuring innovations that are set to change the world, will include a familiar face. Or, rather, voice: Q, introduced in 2019 as the first “genderless AI voice,” is a human voice for use in digital assistants specifically created to be gender-ambiguous.

“Q was designed to start a conversation around why we gender technology when technology has no gender to begin with,” says Ryan Sherman, one of Q’s co-creators. To design the voice, a team of linguists, sound engineers, and creatives collaborated with nonbinary individuals and sampled different voices to land on a sound range they felt had the potential to disrupt the status quo and represent nonbinary people in the world of AI.

When Q was announced several years ago, it was hailed as “[the genderless digital voice the world needs right now](https://www.wired.com/story/the-genderless-digital-voice-the-world-needs-right-now/),” and an acknowledgment of the harm of feminizing assistants, which perpetuates misogynistic stereotypes of women as submissive and obedient. It won praise from a United Nations report on [gender divides in digital skills](https://en.unesco.org/Id-blush-if-I-could). The same report warned that “nearly all of these assistants have been feminized—in name, in voice, in patterns of speech and in personality.” The title of the report—“I’d blush if I could”—was the answer Siri originally provided to users who called it a bitch. (Nowadays, Siri simply replies, “I won’t respond to that.”) In another sign of progress, earlier this year Apple eliminated the default “female” voice for Siri, now including the option for a male voice and allowing US users to choose from a set of voices referred to as voices 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, Google Assistant and Cortana currently let users select a male voice, further proving that companies do respond to public pushback about their products.

Yet uprooting the feminization of digital assistants will take more than just adding a male voice option to the roster. And even the idea of a “genderless AI” voice that registers somewhere between what would be traditionally considered masculine and feminine pitch ranges reveals some of the misconceptions we still confront when thinking about ways to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. In particular, Q might strengthen the outdated belief that nonbinary individuals are neither men nor women, but something in the middle of the binary, rather than outside of it. Instead of striving for “neutrality,” we must reimagine the future of the relationship between digital assistants and gender altogether.

One path forward comes from Yolande Strengers, associate professor of human-centered computing at Monash University and coauthor, with Jenny Kennedy, of *The Smart Wife: Why Siri and Alexa Need a Feminist Reboot*. They don’t think the solution is to remove gender from the equation altogether, because “this oversimplifies the ways in which these devices treat gender, which are not only gendered by voice, but by the types of things that they say, their personalities, their form, and their purpose,” Strengers says. Instead, they propose queering the smart wife so that digital assistants may exist in defiance of gender stereotypes.

Queering the smart wife could mean, in its simplest form, affording digital assistants different personalities that more accurately represent the many versions of femininity that exist around the world, as opposed to the pleasing, subservient personality that many companies have chosen to adopt.

Q would be a fair case of what queering these devices could look like, Strengers adds, “but that can’t be the only solution.” Another option could be bringing in masculinity in different ways. One example might be Pepper, a humanoid robot developed by Softbank Robotics that is often ascribed he/him pronouns, and is able to recognize faces and basic human emotions. Or Jibo, another robot, introduced back in 2017, that also used masculine pronouns and was marketed as a social robot for the home, though it has since been given a second life as a device focused on health care and education. Given the “gentle and effeminate” masculinity performed by Pepper and Jibo—for instance, the first responds to questions in a polite manner and frequently offers flirtatious looks, and the latter often swiveled whimsically and approached users with an endearing demeanor—Strengers and Kennedy see them as positive steps in the right direction.

Queering digital assistants could also result in creating bot personalities to replace humanized notions of technology. When Eno, the Capital One baking robot launched in 2019, is asked about its gender, it will playfully reply: “I’m binary. I don’t mean I’m both, I mean I’m actually just ones and zeroes. Think of me as a bot.”

Similarly, Kai, an online banking chatbot developed by Kasisto—an organization that builds AI software for online banking—abandons human characteristics altogether. Jacqueline Feldman, the Massachusetts-based writer and UX designer who created Kai, explained that the bot “was designed to be genderless.” Not by assuming a nonbinary identity, as Q does, but rather by assuming a robot-specific identity and using “it” pronouns. “From my perspective as a designer, a bot could be beautifully designed and charming in new ways that are specific to the bot, without it pretending to be human,” she says.

When asked if it was a real person, Kai would say, “A bot is a bot is a bot. Next question, please,” clearly signaling to users that it wasn’t human nor pretending to be. And if asked about gender, it would answer, “As a bot, I’m not a human. But I learn. That’s machine learning.”

"BridgesI read /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit's sweet meditation on how small things can bridge the gaps between us - a shower, [a bowl of water](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/ga2934/a_bowl_of_water/), an apple... And yet again, my comment grew into it's own story. He's done that to me before - he's a very low-keyed writer about high-keyed situations. Me, I like reading about bridges between cultures, but I'm one of those people who stares into the abyss under the bridge. Never going to Royal Gorge again - you can see all the way down between gaps in the bridge deck. Speaking of gaps:

# Bridges

**Rats**

I was stuck in an old, concrete French bunker 10 clicks south of the DMZ at Dong Ha in late 1968. It was just me and two South Vietnamese *pháo binh* (artillery) officers, a young *Thiếu Úy* (2nd Lieutenant) and an OLD *Trung Úy* (1st Lieutenant).  I dunno, hard to tell with Asians - but either he was pushing 50 or he'd had a hard life, maybe both. We were clearing fires between our Area of Operation (AO) and the Marines to the left and right of us.

We were living in downtown Dong Ha in an old French base that was HQ for a reinforced regiment (soon to be a division) of ARVNs, the South Vietnamese Army, but was most memorably the home of about 20,000 hairy-tailed Vietnamese rats. The rats helped us bond - rat-watch is serious business.

When I finally left Dong Ha, I had to shake two momma rats out of the two fuzzy metal-one-quart canteen covers attached to my butt pack. I turned the whole assembly over to my battery Supply Sergeant at Quang Tri, and told him about the previous tenants - one mamma left some little squirmy rat-babies behind. I had shaken it out, but they were sticky little buggers. Might have missed one.

The Supply Sergeant edged away from me far enough to establish a ""social distance"" between us, put on gloves and carried the nasty pack to the burn pit. Told me it was a ""combat loss."" In a way. Fine by me.

Sorry. Got carried away by rat hate. Back to Dong Ha.

**Face to Face**

We all got along in the bunker. The *Thiếu Úy*'s English was pretty good. And he could put on an American-face without too much effort.

Hard to explain the concept of ""face"" - I'm not sure I fully understood it anyway. The short definition of ""face"" was the process of maintaining personal dignity, not showing any emotion in front of strangers. Or friends either - not in public anyway. People who grinned and laughed a lot in public or private were considered idiotic, mentally deranged in an offensive way. Fools with no personal pride in themselves.

So yeah, Americans looked like fools and idiots to them. Which was a problem. We were *very* loud, laughed and talked alla damned time, didn't seem to care what others thought. Even the officers seemed to have no self-respect. And that sunny American countenance was, to the Vietnamese, also insulting. If you weren't a fool or an idiot, then you were treating *them* with disrespect by acting like a fool right in front of them.

I'm making it more of a problem than it was. We weren't social robots. We all knew that there were different people in different lands with different customs. Nobody was a fool or an idiot here. No one was being insulted. We were doing the best we could. We were a tight little fire-clearing machine.

The *Trung Úy* was old-school. His French was excellent - English, not so much. Language skills are almost archeological - you can tell how old somebody is by his acquired language skills. The *Trung Úy* was old enough to be out of his element. You have to notice and respect that. My French was laughable - he almost laughed a couple of times. I could see it in his eyes - I took it as a compliment. I just grinned at him like an idiot. We got along. Had to. We were in that bunker on 12 hour shifts.

**Jersey Shore**

In late 1968, the USS New Jersey showed up right offshore from the DMZ. The NJ was an Iowa-class battleship, the last of the WWII vintage still in service. It took up the job of cleaning out all the North Vietnamese artillery positions north of the DMZ. Lovely beast. I had posted a picture of it lifted from *Stars & Stripes* under the glass on one of our desktops. Both Vietnamese lieutenants gave it a look, but weren't that impressed.

Something came up late one afternoon. The Marine Amphibs on the *Của Việt* to our east had a fire mission plotted about 800 meters away from one of our infantry patrols. Normally, I'd clear that easy peasy, but they wanted to use the New Jersey. I called the *Trung Úy* up to the map. ""*Hải pháo* (navy guns), shoot here."" He squinted at the map, got out a little ruler, looked at me like WTF, and said, ""Yah. Shoot.""

I wasn't sure he understood me. I said, ""*Hải pháo*"" again. ""Yah yah, *shoot*!"" he said. I picked up a paper and pen, wrote ""406 mm,"" on the paper and said ""*Hải pháo*,"" again. He parsed it out. ""Four. Zero. Six. Millimetre?"" I nodded. His eyes got wide. ""NO shoot!""

No shit, no shoot. I called off the dogs. The Amphibs weren't in contact or anything. Call me back with a smaller caliber. That ship has 5"" guns, too.

The *Thiếu Úy* had watched the whole thing. He looked at me, made his eyes wide, and said ""NO shoot!"" The *Trung Úy* put his hand over his mouth and made a snurking noise trying to stifle a laugh. Which set off me and the *Thiếu Úy*.  The *Trung Úy* kept his hand over his mouth, but he was laughing until he had tears in his eyes. Clearly, he wasn't used to doing that. But it was a good thing, anyway. Good for the team. We'll make our own face, thankyouverymuch.

**Speaking American**

We did, too. Wasn't as much fun as I thought. Shortly thereafter, there was planning for a big operation. The *Đại Tá* (Colonel) commanding the regiment was on his way to being a general officer in charge of the 3rd ARVN Infantry Division, which is what our regiment was being beefed up to become. The *Đại Tá* had mastered colloquial American English. His American-face was perfect.

We were invited to a meeting of all the ARVN, Marine and Army officers who were going to be part of this multi-national operation to sweep some part of the DMZ. The *Đại Tá* was in charge, and he was introducing people all around, laughing and smiling and cracking jokes.

He came to us: ""This is our artillery liaison unit."" He called us by name. Then he said something like, ""They will check all artillery fires to make sure we don't end up shooting at each other."" He made an alarmed face. Big laugh. ""So if you need artillery clearance, these are the men you should call."" He added more detail about that. Then he said, ""But if you have any questions about anything else, don't call them. They are only Lieutenants."" Another big laugh. I smiled. ""Call our \[Vietnamese words for Operations - S3- TOC\].""

**Dishonor**

When we got back to our bunker, the *Trung Úy* disappeared. Then he came back and called the *Thiếu Úy* out of the bunker. Then they both came back, and the *Thiếu Úy* said. ""*Trung Úy* would like you to repeat what the *Đại Tá* said when he pointed to us. He talked too fast in English to understand.""

Well fuck. He had said we ""were only Lieutenants."" He had made the Americans laugh at us. And they did, they laughed at us. And suddenly I looked down from the bridge of friendship and stolen laughter that connected us, and saw a chasm, thousands of years deep. Shit.

""He was joking with the Americans, "" I said, ""He didn't mean disrespect. Americans are like that."" The *Thiếu Úy* translated - the *Trung Úy* was in no mood to try to use his English, but he heard that. ""Disrespect. Dishonor,"" he said. Then he left the room. ""He is going to see the *Đại Tá*, "" said the *Thiếu Úy*. He was in tears. I felt like throwing up. Crap. This was NOT going to turn out well.

We should've had more faith in the *Đại Tá*. The guy was a good commander, but he was a better politician. He was set to be the new commanding general of a new division, and he was going to need senior officers of some experience. And his officers needed to be loyal. To him. He didn't miss the opportunity.

After a couple of hours, the *Trung Úy* came back to our bunker. I knew this because the *Thiếu Úy* jumped up and saluted as he yelled ""*Đại Úy*! (Captain!), Wut? I turned around, then did the same thing. There was the no-longer-*Trung Úy* standing there with Captain's insignia. He looked grim-faced as he returned our salutes. The *Thiếu Úy* was trying to keep a straight face, but y'know, I was an American.

I was grinning like a fuckin' idiot.

**Addendum**

You gotta love happy endings, but this story doesn't have one. The 3rd ARVN Division came into being, and held the same AO on Highway 1, just south of the DMZ until Spring of 1972. They disintegrated in the face of the massive NVA offensive across the DMZ and down to Quang Tri. Don't know what happened to my friends. Don't have too much to say about it, but that fact seasons this story for me."

"From Roombas to Rosie – Engineering Domestic RobotsProving that our distaste for household chores knows no bounds, people have been dreaming about robots that can do our housework for more than half a century.

From Rosie the Robot, who served the Jetsons, to Bender in Futurama, domestic robots have long been a mainstay of science fiction. Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.

The majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively “mindless” creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you’re having a bad day.

A lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).

Human-Machine Interactions – Developing People Skills

It’s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.

The rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.

We can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.

In other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you’d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions—with some interesting results already—but the technology still has a ways to go.

Navigating Human Environments

As researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today’s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.

However, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.

Add to that the fact that the environment can change without notice—for example, when remodelling—and it’s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.

Researchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.

Reducing Sensor Costs

Just as buying a home computer in the ‘80s wasn’t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today’s robots still aren’t cheap.

One of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.

Bringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.

Domestic Robots Today

While our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.

Take Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as “your smart little companion” by its creators.

The company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it’s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.

In terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it’s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It’s essentially a “tablet on wheels” that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.

There are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.

Then there’s an interactive “social family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)” that’s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it’s still in development.

Palo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.

At a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids—all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball—some people might see it as worth the investment.

Regardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn’t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.

Whether it’s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.

What do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?"
"Journalist looking for parents who bought MOXIE robotHi, my name is Alla Katsnelson and I'm a reporter writing a story about social robots for kids, such as Moxie, that are meant to teach socio-emotional skills. 

I'd like to interview a family or two that has bought MOXIE for their child/children to hear about their experience with it. The story will run in The Guardian. Please let me know if you'd be interested in speaking with me!"
"I am Mark Manson: Former PUA Coach, Self Development blogger, Entrepreneur, AMA**UPDATE: Going to go ahead and close this out. Thanks for the great turn out and great questions guys. Really enjoyed this.**

Hey everybody. Happy to be back on Seddit doing another AMA. I really enjoyed my last one. 

Quick blurb about me: 

I'm a PUA veteran. I found the community in 2005 and got success pretty quickly. I began coaching guys locally in 2007 and in 2008 began my business which was known as ""Practical Pick Up"". Last year I retired from coaching and expanded my business into [Postmasculine.com](http://postmasculine.com), a self-development blog for men. 

When it comes to dating and pick up advice, here's what makes me different:

- Seduction is an emotional process, to become good at seduction is to become an emotionally healthy individual who attains social and sexual confidence. 

- I like to say if you can walk and you can talk then you can pick up a hot girl. There's no skill to it. 

- Don't believe me, then ask yourself this: Why does a first date with a hot woman FEEL so much more complicated and stressful than dinner with a business associate or friend of friend? When confronted with sexual situations, a lot of our emotional baggage, our shame, our insecurities, our poor self image, this stuff all comes roaring out of us. The skill is sorting through this emotional garbage to free yourself up to act openly and confidently no matter who you're with. 

- Attraction is not about what you say or do, but about who you are. You can have the coolest line in the world, but if you're a loser and are desperate to impress her, you will kill any attraction. You could say the dumbest thing in the world, but if you're a cool guy, it won't matter, in fact it will likely make her like you even more. 

- You become an attractive individual by investing in yourself rather than in the women you are pursuing. Sex and women is a side effect of becoming an emotionally competent and sexually confident man, not the cause of it. 

- Honesty is the best policy. As is making yourself vulnerable to rejection and judgment. As is connecting with women on an emotional level. Stop acting like a social robot and create some goddamn romance!

- In my opinion, despite claiming to be ""scientific"" about its processes, PUA completely misses the boat on science. There's decades of scientific research on confidence, self esteem, social anxiety, conquering phobias, sexual insecurity, dating and attraction, and PUA is sorely unaware of a large amount of it. 

- Although I still write a lot about dating, a large portion of my site these days is dedicated to self development, self esteem, life purpose, entrepreneurship, happiness, etc. 

But since this is Seddit, here are some of my better dating articles to check out:

- [Why It's So Hard: Modern Dating for Men](http://postmasculine.com/why-its-so-hard)

- [My Life as a Pick Up Artist](http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist)

- [Power in Vulnerability](http://postmasculine.com/power-in-vulnerability)

- [Shut Up and Kiss Her](http://postmasculine.com/shut-up-and-kiss-her)

- [Meta-Awesomeness](http://postmasculine.com/meta-awesomeness)

Oh, and last thing. This is the one and only open pitch I'll do the whole night. 

I wrote a book. It's called [Models: Attract Women Through Honesty](http://postmasculine.com/models). It's 350 pages, based on real psychological research, and has been called by a number of guys around Seddit as the best book on seduction and dating for men. 

OK, that's all. Ask away!

"The DIFFERENCE between Direct and Indirect Game and What They Are For? What about Hybrid Game?Because I see this discussion probably every other day in some form or another in this sub.. 

This argument is as old as this community (older than this Reddit seduction group) and the answer is simple (yeah right.). Read this in it's entirety. I know some of you are already dogmatic about how you feel but read this entire post and you may discover ideas people haven't discussed.

You're going to find a lot of guys especially these days telling you, ""just go direct bro and be genuine and be yourself."" And then you'll find that many those guys really aren't having that much success anyway, unless they are extremely good-looking and exactly what most girls consider their type. Maybe they approached hundreds of girls and every once in a while have some of modicum of success. But ""a blind hog gets an ear of corn every once in awhile"" as my father used to say.

The truth is, that going direct is only going to work consistently for probably 10% of guys.

For any given guy, it's only going to work sporadically.  It has a low percentage of success. But, it does work. It can work, in the right circumstances and under the right situations. But it's basically a numbers game, it's like playing the lottery. It's a complete crap shoot.

Indirect can work too but it takes a lot of training and honing the skills to get it right, and even so, girls still may not like you. so you can have the best routine and indirect opener or situational opener on Earth, but if the girl is just not interested in you, she pretty much is going to know what you want anyway, despite what are the experts tell you how you're sneaking up on her and trying to catch her off guard and make her want you. No, most girls know on some level exactly what you want when you're going up and talking to them so the indirect is just a way to **display your personality,** not a way to try and sneak in under the radar and trick her into chasing you.

Which one is better?

**The answer is, neither.**

It's not a linear game. **The best guys in this game learn to be dynamic individuals. Flexible. They flow.**

What's that shit Bruce Lee said? *""Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. **If nothing within you stays rigid**, outward things will disclose themselves.*

*Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash! Be water, my friend.""*

**Sometimes direct is better**, depending on the situation and the circumstances that you find yourself in. If I'm walking down the street, and I see a girl I like in a busy City, and I don't have time, and she doesn't have time, then it naturally makes sense for me to go direct. Let's get it going and see what happens! ""Haha, hell no.. I just saw you and if I didn't come say hi, and try and get to know you, I was going to kick myself in the ass for the rest of the day.""

**Plusses:** Grabbing your balls and putting yourself out there. That is good for learning a little bit about how to face that pressure of approaching and getting rejected and even once in a while getting success.

**Minuses:** You do get rejected more often than not, and, **you don't really learn a lot.** The only opportunity to learn from a direct approach is when the girl likes you, and you can take things further.  

Other times, if I'm walking through a Whole Foods, or a Trader Joe's, and I go up and I want to talk to a girl, it's not going to make any sense at all and it's going to come across **socially awkward, uncalibrated and weird or even creepy** if I go up and I'm super direct with a girl.

So in a situation like that, I may want a little bit more finesse based game. ""My mom wants me to eat more spinach, which one do you recommend?""

Again, I don't care what any of the gurus or experts tell you, she already knows what you want. There's the old Dave Chappelle joke that is actually more truthful than a joke and that is, just assume that if a guy is talking to you he's saying, ""want some dick?""

But, what going indirect is going to give you an opportunity to do is be more playful, learn, **and take the social pressure off of her by giving her Social Cover** Social Cover is taking the pressure off of her so that she can actually feel comfortable enough in specific situations, so that she can allow herself to get to know you. an example might be, how I was at the political function once, and there was this really cute girl at the table with me, and we ended up at my house within the next week naked and naughty.

If I would have gone direct, in a political function, now I'm a f****** weirdo and I'm socially awkward and probably there's mental issues as far as she's concerned.  So instead, I go indirect, we already know what I want.  We end up following up later with each other, setting up the date, and things go well. **and, she didn't have to feel like a slut, because the people around her would overhear me going direct asking her out, and she saying yes in front of her peers, workmates etc. So, that gave her an opportunity to accept going out with me, while flying completely under the radar.**

**Plusses:** Learn how to be more finesse based in your interactions, interactions are likely to last longer, so you can learn, be playful, and actually have a longer experience with the woman and the interaction so you can better hone your skills, try new things, and experiment.  Also, in situations where it makes sense, **you are giving her Social Cover** so that she can better get to know you and she can see your personality shine.

**Minuses:** Many guys will use indirect as a way to never pull the trigger. In fact, for some, will become an excuse for them to talk to the girl, and never express intent, and one can get caught in cycles of talking to girls for long periods of time and leaving the interaction and being the chatty nice guy. At some point you will have to shift gears and go direct in the interaction.

**On Social Cover:** This is the key. Going direct or indirect, it has nothing to do with being an alpha male, or being a pussy, or being a real man, honest, genuine and making your intentions known and yada yada yada. **None of that is relevant when it comes to seduction.** Girls don't give a f***. Guys do, yeah some keyboard jockey who wrote a book on the internet will care because to him and his ego, ""being a real man"" is a big deal, but to the girls, no. Showing social savviness is all she's going to care about. **Is she attracted to you? Is she not attracted to you? How you go about it, she doesn't give 2fux.**

Let's continue...

So when I used to do boot camps, before I just started mentoring guys which seems more effective in the long run anyway, I would have my students always start out going direct.

For their first 10-20-30 sets or whatever it is, I would make them only go direct. Why? Because I wanted them to get over that fear that they had of going and expressing interest to a girl. And that's what direct is super handy for as far as learning. one can use it to get over their fear, their Hang-Ups about approaching socially, their approach anxiety or whatever you guys call it these days.. they can acclimate themselves to being under pressure and uncomfortable doing approaches. But after a while, once you're over that, now you're just spinning your wheels and you're not progressing and you're not getting better and you're not learning. **You're NOT becoming more attractive.** 

You're just playing a numbers game. At that point, you're just being lazy. You're throwing away the **opportunity to learn** to be creative, dynamic, and to be able to flow and be seductive in different situations.

After that, however, I would give them indirect openers to start trying. Why? because I expressed above, it creates a more playful and finesse the based mindset, and it actually **causes someone to become more creative in their mind, attitudes and actions** so that they can adapt and adjust to situations much better in interactions over the **Long haul.**

I hope you're getting the picture. Basically there is no better than. And there is, **Jeet kune do**.

Bruce Lee's idea is basically, what mixed martial arts has become today. Who is better? The wrestler or the striker? The guy with this style, or that style? Well, the answer to that is, usually **the guy who has a fantastic working knowledge of all.** And that's your answer here.  

Use them both appropriately for what they are for, and learn in your experience what situations are going to be better off with you using direct, and what situations are going to make more sense for you going indirect, and **most importantly - how to be flexible with your game and when to shift gears.**

Girl at a nightclub on the dance floor shaking her ass? Probably direct why not?

Girl at a networking event where people are dressed in suits and ties and women are dressed in nice dresses, horderves are being passed around, people are sipping wine and fancy cocktails, you're probably not going to go direct or you're going to come across like a f****** weirdo. So, now you can go indirect and display to her that you're a sexy, attractive, socially calibrated guy, and you can show up and utilize your finesse based game.

By the way, my two examples of openers from above in my breakdowns, those both ended up in situations where I was naked with the girls so go figure.

I hope this makes sense. my only word of warning is if you find a guy who's dogmatic about either one, and says that only ""be genuine, only go up and be yourself, just be honest with the girl, just go direct, bro, you don't need all that pick up stuff!"" That guy is likely full of shit. Either that, or, he just happens to be that really good looking guy that girl's find attractive and so his experience is **extremely limited** for the average guy.

On the flip side, if you got that guy who says, only indirect works, only use routine based game, only develop a routine stack and you only need to be a social robot and go out and be like this a weird creepy pick up guy that only uses pick up routines, and is never actually learning how to be himself, that is bad too. Because even if that guy is pretty decent at getting women, he's usually really creepy, weird, socially awkward, and has mental or emotional issues from always believing that he's not good enough to get a girl on his own.

So, if there was a tldr I would say one word: **HYBRID**

**The BEST interactions are usually a combination of both.**

Good luck."

"Autistic INFP hereI was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, around the second grade. My second grade teacher told my parents that she thought I might be autistic (I don't imagine that such a conversation can be anything other than awkward), I got tested by two doctors: the first doctor was young, and probably inexperienced, he said that I was too social to have autism. Doctor #2 was a bit better, and diagnosed me. More specifically, I was diagnosed with a subset of autism that used to be called ""Asperger's syndrome"", but since then, the DSM has gotten rid of all sub-designations of autism, and just made it a spectrum. The DSM did no favors for anyone by making it a spectrum, even if it was more scientifically accurate.



Since then, I've tested as an INFP several times. I'm relatively good in the empathy & socialization department, compared to many others with autism.




Here's my problem. If you look at the stereotype for people with ""Asperger's"", and INTPs, the stereotype is pretty much the same: nerdy, socially robotic, very rational.


I identify with INFPs, because this subreddit's basically what introduced me to the MBTI scale and community, so I may have been slightly biased when I did the tests, but I don't think it's too far off.





Fun fact about autism: Y'know how robots are portrayed in books and movies as being very rational, and having very poor emotional and social skills? Well, that's probably because the first fiction writer to give much thought to robots, Isaac Asimov, had autism, and probably experienced the struggle with whether or not he had the mind of a human or a machine."
"The pre-singularity period is exciting in its own way | Much like our ancestors and great-grandfathers, we live in an epoch of two worlds that compete and coexistI'm a strange man for strange reasons. There's nothing more fascinating to me than the image of sitting outside on a cool evening drinking ice-water, watching stars sprinkle onto the Belt of Venus, listening to cicadas right alongside a companion robot. A social robot like Pepper could fill that niche for me. 

Yet when I tell people about this, many find it comical, if not jarring. [Robots like Pepper look a tad creepy](http://i.imgur.com/Ks55jK3.gifv). They seem out of place. Though their abilities are limited, Pepper still seems like something from the future because humans still have a natural psychological propensity to imbue intelligence into things that resemble us or act intelligently. It's an artificially intelligence humanoid robot! And because of science fiction, we tend to place these things mostly inside high-tech laboratories, on the streets of a megacity, and maybe slaving on a farm. It's almost a waste to think of sending one of these things out into the boonies just so some random Redditor can spend time with it listening to bugs calling for mates.

Yet that jarring sense that I'm using tomorrow's toys for yesterday's joys is nothing new. People experienced the same fascinating clash throughout the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. This was the root of the Romanticist literary and art movements. The contrasting worlds set the mood for the Edwardian Age, the Belle Epoque, and the Interwar period. It was the inability to recognize that old traditions no longer functioned in the modern world that led to the savagery of the First World War.

World Wars 1 and 2 are extremely fascinating to me because this period was the peak of the pre-digital industrial world. You saw advancements in science, in engineering, in the human condition itself as things our ancestors took for granted fell before our casual experimentation with electromagnetism, nuclear engineering, genetics, and so much more.

I actually have a whole ""Saved"" section full of geriatric Redditors talking about life in the past and historians laying out how change came so rapidly that it would make modern Singularitarians blush. How it was a world of seeming contradictions:

How most of the world lived in extreme poverty under kingdoms or their equivalents (imperial autocracies, sultanates, khanates, princely states, etc.) and the idea that there was some segment of society that ruled because God willed it was treated as a natural norm. How the average person plowed without machinery on little plots of land. How women were actively discouraged from gaining an education or finding jobs outside of wartime. How even in the '50s it was common in the US South to see horse-drawn carriages in small-town streets, to read old literature by candlelight, to only eat food grown by your family or someone your family knows, to create utensils out of spare metal parts and recycle them endlessly because you didn't have any culture of disposability, to give birth in the homestead because it was not common for hospitals to have such wards.

A time when some people had never seen artificial light (that is, not from the sun or by fire). Yet also a time when mankind learned how to set sail in the skies, ride in motorized carriages (nowadays shortened to 'cars'), *even discover that something as simple as washing your hands kept surgery patients alive.*

When the world was industrialized but there were still pockets where civilization had not meaningfully changed since the Renaissance or even before, when there were still nomadic tribes living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged since before the Sumerians while urban hipsters played with cameras and mechanical gadgets. 

When peasants were still a large class in the world and were so removed from whatever was going on in life that they had no reason to believe the 21st century would be any different from the 19th, all the while the Victorian Internet arose across the West to allow for instant communication among different nations.

When archers and swordsmen were still highly valued parts of Western and Eastern militaries alongside machine gunners and air forces (I believe the last cavalry charge took place in World War II?). 

When racism was a beast clashing between those who cared about national ethnicity more like the Athenians and Han vs. those who saw like-skin color as the only requirement (ironically a more 'progressive' form of racism only possible in modern times). When conception of a child was still seen as a miracle rather than an understood scientific process, but psychology was in its infancy as we realized how the brain affected behavior rather than myths of humors and astrological mysticism. 

When rockets broke out of the Earth's atmosphere and rural folk rode to their relatives on horseback to hear about it. 

When nostalgic scenes of young boys and girls catching frogs in streams coexisted with futurists marveling at wirelessly driven cars and televisions gaining color.

That era, from the 1890s to the 1950s, was the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, when industrialism bore most of its fruit. For the most part, that era of contradictions has passed as the fruits of the Industrial Revolution spread to all corners of the planet (though in unequal amounts). Nowadays, even hunter-gatherer tribes use modern technology and wear modern clothing and retain their lifestyle mostly out of tradition; anomalies like the Sentinelese are just that. It's so rare to see people riding on horseback as their primary means of transportation that it can reach the top of /r/TodayILearned just to learn about it and they tend to be compared to the Amish.

And that's the truth of it. What was once pockets of the old ways coexisting with modernity shrunk to literal motes of quaintness and tradition. These won't go away, but they will be joined by what we call modernity soon enough.

You see, the Digital Revolution is a fundamentally different event entirely, one we're still trying to recognize in full. Industrialism was when we began supplanting human muscle and automating machinery with analog clockwork. 

Digitalism, on the other hand, began the rise of cognitive automation. It is my firm belief that, if we never invented digital computing or mass produced Turing-complete machines, societal evolution would have stagnated sometime around 1960-1970. As great as our machines were and as much progress in the sciences as we made, it was all low-hanging fruit that we could reach.

There are more fruits hanging above and we cannot reach them without digital technology. They require skills only a handful of savants and polymaths could ever realize, and there are many more skills no human or biological lifeform can ever learn or utilize. Fruits we still managed to reach because of the Digital Revolution. 

It's been nearly a century since the start of the Digital Revolution, but we've already entered the maturation period. 

And because of this, we're beginning to see familiar contradictions arise. You can see it argued on /r/Futurology all the time, reports coming out endlessly that jobs will be sacrificed to the machines. And the familiar refrain is ""But the robots will create more jobs in response!"" The horses analogy popularized by CGP Grey is fine by itself, but I am more reminded by how established-industrialists and traditionalists a century ago said ""X is a passing fad"". It wasn't just cars. There were predictions that electric lamps, television, radio, *even nuclear physics* were just fads. 

And if you want to go old-school, people in centuries prior claimed that industrial machines themselves were a cute novelty but ""we had more than enough manpower""; printed books were neat but ""oral storytelling will regain its place soon enough""; guns were an unusual and egalitarian development but ""they pale in comparison to a fine archer"" (something I touched upon earlier, how there were military officials as late as the Franco-Prussian War who hoped that archers would re-replace riflemen due to the inaccuracy of guns of the day). 

Today, its honestly no different when people look at the latest in robotics, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms and say ""It looks cool, but there'll always be jobs for people"". We don't recognize that it's the limitations of modern technology that allow us to be so confident in oru doubts until we are old and reflecting on how we ever believed anything but the new normal.


I sincerely believe that, over the next two to three decades, more coexisting contradictions will come about. Things such as using smartphones and physical computers while cyberkinetic wireless connections to the internet exist; writing books and making music and drawing cartoons when it's possible to [synthesize art](/r/MediaSynthesis); visit physical stores when drones can deliver to you directly and fabricators/3D printers can allow you to download whatever you need; create multimedia experiences for emotional impact when direct brain-to-brain emotional communication is possible; work at your uncle's little restaurant while fully-automated mines are established on other planets to pre-empt human exploration; visiting concerts of your favorite band while others use virtual reality to see concerts of bands that have long since split and passed on, or even bands and musical scenes that never existed until the computer synthesized it a few hours ago; spraying distilled chemicals to freshen the air in your room when neural stimulation can let you re-experience any sensation; playing with cats and dogs while we resurrect long-extinct species like mammoths and perhaps even our sisters like the Neanderthals or genetically modifying any animal directly to make it domesicated and docile no matter how reptilian and hostile it may be in the wild; and, going back to my original tale, sitting outside in a plastic chair enjoying an evening alongside a robotic companion. 

The internet was the first big, juicy fruit of the Digital Revolution that impacted your life. It was and remains proto-telepathy, the planet becoming aware of itself. It is now developing into an actual space of political and social development and has to be taken seriously by those who once cast it aside as a distraction. And to be fair, it *was* once a distraction. Technology has not yet augmented us; it distracts us. Human enhancement still lies ahead, but it's very close and the Internet is something of a test-run to see how we can handle constant exposure to others. 

We no longer live in a world where history is mostly written through the posh dialects of aristocrats and clerics with society left to be viewed through their eyes and minds; we now see that the world is full of meaty, greasy, hypersexual, xenophobic, childish, and yet still empathic and intelligent apes and always has been. Right now, we still mostly look at the ""Old Days"" and see people of culture and civility, not realizing that they were just as crass as we are but 99% of people were illiterate and the 1% who weren't wrote only what they thought was important to know. The Internet equalized all of that.

But it hasn't actually changed anything. If 4chan existed in the Roman empire, it wouldn't fundamentally be any different than how it is now. But we are on the cusp of an age of humans and non-humans who discuss things and share knowledge in ways many can't grasp. 

And in a manner, this makes modern society all that much more exciting to watch develop."
"From Dating to Girlfriend: How to Make That Special  Girl your GirlfriendThere I was, staring at the ceiling with a smile on my face trying to figure out how I ever lived my life without her. Emotions were running through my mind as the replay of our night together echoed in my mind. I knew that my social skills got me to this place but I was not sure how to make her my girlfriend. I knew that I wanted to go from dating to a committed relationship but how do you do that?  
The process of learning how to make a girl your girlfriend was a painful one for me and so I hope that through this article you save yourself the mistakes that I made. 


The first thing that you MUST understand about making a girl your girlfriend is that love never dies of starvation, but often of indigestion. When we find something we like we often hold on to it so tight that it dies in our hands. We see this principal played out all the time in our lives when we spend too much time with some we end up getting annoyed with them and find someone else to be around for awhile. Think of this principal another way…

**.. Familiarity breeds contempt. **

The last thing that you want to do is suffocate your potential girlfriend with too much of you. Space things out and relax. 

**Tip #1: Space out the time you see her. **

If you want her to be your girlfriend you have to allow her to space to miss you. I know that every fiber of your being is saying something different and your heart is yelling at you to call her and see her but you have to allow some space between you two or you will suffocate each other before you know it. This is why I often suggest that you see each other once or twice a week. If you are spending 5 days together you are going to breed contempt at a much quicker pace because you have not allowed the emotions to calm down a bit. 


**Tip #2: Stop trying to “game” her. **

I cannot emphasize enough how important this tip is. Guys who learn some social skills never shut off there “game” and they try to hold her attention with gifts, texts and anything they can do to look good.  You must stop treating her as something you want to “accomplish” and start being a human being around her. It’s ok to mess up, show affection, show emotions and loosen up a bit. 


**She isn’t a game guys, she’s a girl. **

If you continue to “game” her she is going to get the feeling she is getting played and walk at some point. Believe me when I say that I have screwed this up so many times. You have to have the ability to be vulnerable because opening up and sharing is where love is formed. 


**Tip #3: Get a life.**

If you drop your life to be with her she won’t respect you in the long run. Hopefully you had a life before her and you should have one while you are with her. Many times guys will ditch their friends and lives just to spend more time with their crush but all the while they are doing more harm than good. This goes back to a post I wrote on scarcity vs. abundance.(http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/exd7y/scarcity_vs_abundance_how_neediness_kills_your/) If you have no other social options in your life then your neediness will kill every positive gain that you get.  
You MUST man up and overcome your longing to spend every minute with her. Allow her to know what it’s like when you’re not there and give her space to clear her head. When you allow her space you are respecting her and this grows the connection between you two. 


**More Thoughts…**

The more you play the game the less likely you are to win. 
Ever sit down to play games at a casino? If you win but continue to play over time you are bound to lose. If this girl likes you and you continue to play the game then you are bound to lose. People want to feel connected to their partners. They don’t want to feel they are the object of some game but they want to feel like there is another person who connects with them and values them. Being a social robot is about shutting off all emotions that make us human and if you do this you will never keep the girl that you want. 

At the end of the day she doesn’t belong to you and you don’t belong to her. Only she makes the decision to be with you or not and only you can make that decision for yourself. If you shut yourself off and live in a world where you are going to try to “get” this girl then you are setting yourself up for failure. 

Give her space, allow her freedom to make decisions and continue having fun. Pretty soon she is going to open up and give you hints about being exclusive. I often say that a guy tends to decide when the relationship happens and the woman decides when sex happens. Be a man and allow her room to grow or you will destroy the very thing you want to create. 

All the best,

Mayson

"Jibo is getting dumber, not smarter.I hate to say it but I am getting more and more disappointed with this so-called social robot every day. Jibo no longer knows who I am, whereas he used to recognize me easily. Now when I ask him who I am, he says he doesn't know. So I tell him, and he says ""got it, thank you"". Then I ask him who I am... he says he doesn't know. LOL  Also, he is much more prone to interrupting conversations than before. I thought that issue was being addressed but obviously not. He has very few useful skills and I find myself simply asking Alexa 99% of the time, because with her I get a useful answer. In short, the Echo is amazing, and sadly, Jibo is annoying and pretty useless. I hope there is still a chance for this thing to ""grow"", but my wife already wants me to 'take it out of the kitchen and put it back in the box it came in, for all the good it does.' Sad indeed.  "
"New ship date for Early Access AnnouncedHello Jibo Family,

When we launched Jibo’s 2014 Indiegogo campaign, we set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Today, we are thrilled to bring to you the Jibo Early Access Program – our plan to provide you (as one of the first 2,500 Indiegogo supporters who opted to receive a pre-launch robot) your special bot. Beginning September 18, we will ship these early access units on a first-ordered, first-received basis, scheduled to be completed by the week of October 30.

We’re confident that you and your family and friends will bond with Jibo right out of the box. Once the initial set-up is complete, you can interact with Jibo in various ways. For example, you can ask him to snap a picture, the next week’s weather forecast, the location of the nearest coffee shop, who won yesterday’s baseball game or who was the U.S. president in 1850. Because he’s proactive, playful and spontaneous by nature, he’ll greet you by name and may even share a joke. He’s also a terrific dancer and loves when you pat his head. Powered by emerging facial and voice recognition technology, he can recognize up to 16 people in your family. With every interaction he has, he’s learning and sharpening his skills.

During this early access period, Jibo will still be in a developmental stage. This means that while you’ll have first access to a powerful, maturing robot whose potential is virtually limitless, we’ll continue to optimize and improve Jibo. Jibo’s platform will support many future capabilities and improvements, all of which will be introduced automatically over-the-air by Jibo, Inc. We look forward to providing new, exciting announcements about his evolving features in the coming months.

Thank you in advance for volunteering to be a part of this important program. We will rely on your feedback regarding all aspects of Jibo's current performance, and this will help us to fine-tune him for public release.



From all of us at Jibo, Inc., we hope you’re as excited as we are to bring Jibo into your home. Thank you for your continued support as we create a truly revolutionary social robot!

 

Steve Chambers, CEO"
"Jibo SDK updateJust got this...

Dear Developer and Campaign Supporter,  

On Tuesday we sent you an email to update you with Jibo’s delivery information, and to confirm your interest in continuing to be part of the Jibo Early Access Program.  We set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Now, we’ve done it, and Jibo robots are ready for delivery to early access program participants.
Our goal from day one was to deliver Jibo and the tools developers would need to create amazing skills for Jibo.  What we have learned, as other hardware-based platforms have, is this is very hard to do.  There are many learnings as you bring the physical platform to market.  For us, one of those learnings has been a better way to architect skills for Jibo.  This has resulted in a shift in approach that takes full advantage of the cloud and substantially increases skill switching speed and memory efficiency.  As an owner of Jibo, we think you will appreciate these changes.  As a Jibo developer, we know you will.  
Unfortunately, these changes will delay our next public release of developer tools.  We have not finalized the date for the re-launch of our developer tools, but we will be sure to keep the community updated on this via our developer newsletter and blog. 

With this news, we hope you are still keenly interested in being apart of the Jibo Early Access Program.  We will work to get you the tools you need as quickly as we can.  Please know we appreciate the interest developers are showing in Jibo as a platform. The developer community remains a core part of our strategy to extend Jibo’s capabilities and role in people’s homes.

We hope this doesn’t change your interest in receiving Jibo into your home. 
 
We continue to look forward to what you bring to life on Jibo.
Sincerely,
Team Jibo"
"How To Stop Anxiety From Sabotaging Your Love Life NOW!### How To Stop Anxiety From Sabotaging Your Love Life Now!

### This essay seeks to define the negative effects of anxiety on dating. The positive effects of confidence on dating, and strategies the reader can use, to reduce anxiety while simultaneously boosting confidence and dating skills, with the goal of having a healthy love life.

### anxiety

### n. an emotion characterized by apprehension and somatic symptoms of tension in which an individual anticipates impending danger, catastrophe, or misfortune. The body often mobilizes itself to meet the perceived threat: Muscles become tense, breathing is faster, and the heart beats more rapidly. Anxiety may be distinguished from fear both conceptually and physiologically, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Anxiety is considered a future-oriented, long-acting response broadly focused on a diffuse threat, whereas fear is an appropriate, present-oriented, and short-lived response to a clearly identifiable and specific threat. —anxious adj.

### social anxiety

### fear of social situations in which embarrassment may occur (e.g., making conversation, meeting strangers, dating) or there is a risk of being negatively evaluated by others (e.g., seen as stupid, weak, or anxious). Social anxiety involves apprehensiveness about one’s social status, role, and behavior. When the anxiety causes an individual significant distress or impairment in functioning, a diagnosis of social phobia may be warranted.

### depression

### n.

### 1. a negative affective state, ranging from unhappiness and discontent to an extreme feeling of sadness, pessimism, and despondency, that interferes with daily life. Various physical, cognitive, and social changes also tend to co-occur, including altered eating or sleeping habits, lack of energy or motivation, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and withdrawal from social activities. It is symptomatic of a number of mental health disorders.

### -American Psychological Association Dictionary

### Problem:

### Anxiety, social anxiety, and depression are all unhealthy expressions of what happens to humans when they are disconnected socially, mentally, or physically from other humans. As such they lead to unhealthy behaviors that serve as a warning or barrier to starting healthy relationships with others including potential romantic partners.

### Solution A:

### Beyond the obvious, slow-acting, and hit or miss solutions of, getting to a higher social standing in life, making more money, and working out more, Solution A is ‘Pick Up’ or ‘Game’.

### This is the study of human dating relationships, opening, rapport, and sexual interaction. Like any science, moral judgments are not applied, the focus is simply on what works. I.e what gets you laid while not infringing on the legal rights of others.

### And make no mistake it works.

### However, though it serves to make the individual more efficient at dealing with their approach-anxiety, and provides a framework within which to approach and begin relationships more easily, It actually does little to reduce the actual anxiety the individual is feeling.

>**This is why Mystery can be the top pickup artist in the world and still be suicidal when rejected by a girl-friend.**  
**-The Game, Neil Strauss**  


### Moral: You can know everything about pick-up and still not know enough to maintain a satisfying, healthy, and happy relationship with a woman.

### Solution B:

### Psychological And Emotional Maturity Through Therapy;

### This includes study, therapy, support groups, joining social groups, better sleep, diet and exercise, journaling, meditation, etc.

### The list is by no means exhaustive, but shows just a few of the strategies available to you, to become more well-rounded and healthier.  I highly recommend “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari, as well as “The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind” by Joseph Murphy for a deeper dive into how Anxiety and Depression work and the proper use of your own mind.

### Solution B will lead to a happier and healthier life which will eventually trickle down to your love life, but for a more direct, hands-on and more efficient route, I present.

### Solution C:

### Simultaneously  studying “Game” to increase your proficiency with starting romantic relationships with women of quality,

### AND

### Reducing anxiety and increasing confidence and self-esteem, by taking part in therapies that are proven to increase mental, physical, and emotional health.

### Solution A can be seen as ‘offense’ or outer-game, it makes it so you know what the possibilities are in any social situation especially dating.

### While solution B, can be seen as ‘defense’ or your inner-game, it makes it so you know what the healthy, decent choice is, in any social situation especially dating, and gives you the inner strength and resilience to be at peace with your decision.

### I believe solution C is currently, the most efficient dating strategy available to humans.

### *Everything I write and teach, I have tried and tested. The last few years have been a blur of shallow, though fun relationships, whether gaming with bros, or getting with girls.

### It was great, but over COVID, I had a “Come to Jesus” moment where I realized I was having lots of shallow fun but was not actually improving as a person, I had plateaued. I could start a romantic relationship with anyone but few lasted after the initial consummation and almost none of the women I “dated” are currently in my life. What a waste. This is why I sought out how to actually improve myself and my health as opposed to just getting better and better with women. And now I am here to pass on that knowledge.

### In conclusion, work on dealing with your inner-game (mental health) while working on your outer-game (tactics and strategies), to become a healthier, happier person with ""game"". Don’t become a social robot, whose every waking thought is “game” and don’t become addicted to sex or love.

### And if you seek a frame-work or teacher to help guide you on this wonderful journey, contact me, I can work with you remotely.

### All the best, brothers.

"Big Mistake: Day 169 (IMPORTANT)I lost my streak on day 169. I know those of you who have yet to pass the 90 day mark might not understand how it is possible but I will tell you exactly what built up to this moment and so you can refocus your efforts if needed, and mostly so I can come clean with myself.

1. Improper Motivation: I had begun the journey expecting never to watch porn or jerk off again, and to  instead save it for a girl. While granted, I was able to get into talks with a girl within a month and now be able to call her my girlfriend. Calm down, this new sense of confidence is mostly a placebo, but an important one that should be angeled differently. 

2. Don’t let the source of your confidence rely on the binary outcome of relapsing. “Feel guilty, it’s healthy that you regret previous actions. But don’t feel shame, as you aren’t that same person, you learned from your mistakes and are a changed man”- Terry Crews. 

3. Back to the girlfriend. It’s amazing to have her and I told her my whole NoFap story but she doesn’t know of any of the details, including this one of course. Which is fine, but as you can see, it’s due in part to the fact that I feel guilty. If COVID hadn’t come around, I guarantee you I would be out there trying to get some. Now I obviously wouldn’t be trying to force myself upon her in any way, but lingering in the back of my mind is the #1 motivating factor who has been cheering me on all along— and he’s telling me that the clock is ticking on rent. I’m not gonna lie, I probably would’ve “got some” if I had the past couple of months in the outdoors with her having an intimate physical relationship. But would that fix things? I would just crave more and my driving factor would be to have more sex, even if it does revolve around a girl attracted to me. And Joe Rogan made a decent point on how some of these successful fapstronauts made it out, but that they may be subject to relationships with people solely for the reason to have sex. Maybe that’s a good problem to have, maybe that not what the nofap movement stands for. But I assure you that some people who start with the wrong mindset and end up finding out that they are fuckable enough might find that pitfall too late in their journey. Nevertheless, that reality never came to fruition obviously, and I don’t live in a softly hit area by COVID so people take it seriously. I instead realized I was becoming increasingly interested in having sex with nothing to work with. I was cracking and I can see it in retrospect. I remember having delusional fantasies over what my first time would be like and how I would go absolutely above and beyond in the bedroom in all sorts of pornographically driven manners. It was all fake, and once I was living in that make believe work, my internal compass decided that pseudo-porn wasn’t so bad after all (talked about next). And thenI broke obviously, but not how most would think it would happen.

3. It started with innocent searches that lead me to a link that either offered somewhat lewd content or straight up finding out someone I know or consume alternate content from also makes porn. That 50/50 fight I had with myself, debating whether I should look because I was “curious” but not jerking off was justified. It truly was a 50/50. Sometimes I would cave in and sometimes I wouldn’t. I remember when I first saw it after like 3 months, and the absolute rush I felt (mostly in part due to the “rebellious” adrenaline). That’s when I knew just the act of viewing was supporting my previous addiction and was as bad as jerking off. But that slow release of my boundaries led to the ultimatum that was: Day 169. 

4. I have learned all of the above and now realize the roots that I must not stray from, all of which ground me to the idea of not rewarding myself to a chemical blast to my receptors for literally nothing. 

5. FINALLY: Most important factor. Being aware. Mindfulness. I won’t lie to you, there were many other little things and misconceptions and fantasies and mistakes that lead to my ultimate downfall. And I will also tell you, I am no stranger to mindfulness. I will establish my credibility by saying this, I have been practicing some form of mindfulness, throughout my entire life through my native religion Buddhism. Of course my mindfulness wasn’t fully fledged, and many other “followers” didn’t practice it enough or at all. My point is is that some of you claim to have mindfulness, and of course you are the only one who can really decide that, but be aware (lol) that you have leagues to progress before becoming truly mindful, and that’s the sort of mindfulness that people claim to be the killer of chemical desire. And yes it’s cultivated through trial and error, not just time and practice, just like any other skill. Funny note, mindfulness shouldn’t make you a social robot, nor should nofap make you an instant pimp. I will go back to my Buddhist roots and advise you that “the middle path” is the way to go, especially when it comes to your general mindset. 

5. Haha 169 lol. Yea I stopped counting for the most part after reaching 90 days, but I remember the start date. I counted it back after failing, and it was 169 and I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. 

6. Bonus Story 1: I fought the beast for control on day 170 after feeling like I learned my lesson on day 169 and being happy that I can start over correctly. Yea guess what, it’s still a shitty chemical drug and it doesn’t give a fuck about a change in a sudden change of heart. I came (lol) very close to failing, but luck was on my side and I snapped out of it. Back into control like Majin Vegeta— I wouldn’t allow my pride to be tainted by fools gold, especially a second time.

7. Bonus Story 2: And today, day 171, I had to get over yet another misconception/fucked up idea in my head. It’s hard to realize mistakes (especially small ones you gloss over) and it’s even harder to implement change. I probably will learn something new and get close to making an old mistake twice tomorrow, that’s just how life is. Whenever you feel trapped in your head that’s considering relapsing talk to yourself audibly or in your mental, knock on that locked door and yell and shout until that brain that has been washed with dopamine that is being driven by an addict stops driving and turns an ear to person outside who just wants a ticket to come aboard and get back in control of their own mind. Thank you, and don’t be afraid to laugh at your own struggles, it helps put things into perspective and can put you in a better mood after escaping a dark place or even failing, you can get back up. Life goes on, don’t leave yourself behind."

"Jibo Status Update from CEO Steve ChambersJibo Family, 

We had a productive month here at Jibo working hard towards our goal of robot delivery to the pre-buyer community in October 2016. I wanted to provide a quick update on this past month’s development and delivery milestones and share those Jibo capabilities on which we’ll focus in the near future. 

Last week we launched the Jibo SDK (software developer kit) publicly so any developer worldwide can now become a Jibo developer. Some quick background for those of you unfamiliar with the SDK: Jibo is not only the world's first social robot for the home but also the first developer platform with personality. We are looking forward to seeing what developers build using the tools in the Jibo SDK, both for their own enjoyment and for the Jibo Skill Store. 

This past month we announced our partnership with gaming leader Bandai Namco who will use the Jibo SDK to deliver interactive games. The first game they will create is a family trivia game starring Pac-Man where Jibo is the game master and host. We will continue to work with the developer community to bring additional skills to your homes in the future.

This month was productive and important for our design team who conducted a series of usability tests -- tests where we observe different consumer groups (different ages, genders, family groups, etc.) -- with a specific focus on children interacting with Jibo. The kids in our focus groups really seemed to take to Jibo and provided valuable insight into how to make Jibo more expressive, understandable and interactive, specifically in activities like building an interactive story. Usability research is key to our fine-tuning the Jibo consumer experience and we will engage in usability testing each week through launch and beyond. 

From a manufacturing and operations standpoint, we’re scheduled to finish our final run of prototypes and begin our first run of production Jibos. Building production Jibos is an important milestone in our path to delivering Jibos to our pre-buyer community members. Production Jibos allow us to finalize the electrical, mechanical and production/quality aspects of the Jibo program, including Jibo’s ability to download over-the-air updates via WiFi, while we continue to develop, test and refine the software components that fuel the Jibo experience.  In short, we’re making sure Jibo is ready for production manufacturing so a) we can hit our delivery schedules and b) so Jibo is ready to download the latest-greatest software when consumers connect to WiFi in their homes.  

Next month, Jibo design and software development groups will continue usability testing with Jibo Jot and Jibo Snap, this time with adults. The SDK team will tackle several powerful new features like the Jibo Flow Editor and Jibo Animation Editor, both of which we’ll detail for our Developer community at developers.jibo.com.  We will continue to improve Jibo's picture quality, single and multi-user facial tracking, and motion detection. We will also continue to advance the Jibo audio experience, working on finalizing his sound effects, pre-recordings, voice (text-to-speech), and more.

The next few months will be filled with additional milestones reached and we’re excited to share what’s to come prior to delivering Jibo to your homes in October 2016.

Steve Chambers

**Companion Bots:**

**Study bots:** By 2025, it's expected that every child will benefit from an ""Einstein-like"" smart tutor that will customize study plans based on personalized interests and preferred learning methods, reflecting differences between abilities and fast and slow learners. Bots are also in development that can teach muscle memory in the form of a wearable device that can instruct in art, piano or other tasks by haptic feedback, though the effectiveness of this learning method has yet to be proven.

**Therapy bots:** Research using humanoid social robots is underway to evaluate the brain signals of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using EEG and video cameras to record interaction with the robot. ASD affects 1 in 68 children and its early diagnosis has a large impact on treatment efficacy. Moreover, ongoing research has shown that robot-assisted interventions can teach social and academic skills to autistic children, including emotion recognition.

**Friendship bots:** Many companies are specializing in friendship bots in a variety of humanoid and animal forms. The same advances in perceptual and cognitive AI that will benefit other scenarios will increase the sophistication of decision trees and subtle responses to human stimuli, creating either a new member of the family or a companion for warding off loneliness.

**Bionic Bots:**

**Exoskeletons:** Combining mechanics, sensors, AI, and mobile computing, smart exoskeletons are already available, Algorithms in rigid exoskeletons for the shin and foot can customize assisted walking to the wearer. The market for exoskeletons will be worth US$1.89 billion at a CAGR of 41.3%.

**Prosthetics:** With a more specific application than exoskeletons, smart prosthetics are getting smarter, with machine learning able to make the brain-limb connection that automatically conveys the intention of an action to the limb. However, ML isn't the ideal solution for prosthetics, as the wearer needs to ""teach"" the limb a given motion by mentally repeating it over and over again. Current research is focusing on a musculoskeletal computer model that acts as a bridge between the brain and prosthetic. 

**Augmentation devices:** Bionic lenses that can potentially replace the eye's natural lens with camera optics are also on the horizon. This technology would naturally format images, bringing with it an immediate improvement to eyesight and clarity of vision regardless of distance. Over 39 million fully blind people and 246 million people visually impaired people worldwide will benefit from augmenting technologies.

**Butler Bots:**  


Butler bots in various forms can pick up slack and perform basic tasks like folding clothes, vacuuming, and picking things up. In scenarios like fires, gas leaks, or break ins, butler bots can serve a variety of functions: averting them through alerts; performing first response, for example, locking doors, shutting down a gas supply, or activating a home sprinkler system; using embedded cameras to transmit home layouts to the authorities in image, plan, or video form on cloud; and, of course, preventing false alarms. 

Already in 200 million homes around the world, butler bots will continue to learn the preferences and usage habits of individual family members and provide a range of home services for individuals and families based on voice commands, sensors, and apps."
"The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide to Never Run Out Of Things To Say Revealed | Talk ForeverIt's Saturday Night. You decide you don't wanna stay home, so you go out to that place you like downtown! You get there and you're a little anxious. Everyone is already dancing, talking, vibing, etc. For you, it's normal! You've already taught yourself to acknowledge your anxiety and proactively work to overcome it. So, you take some deep breathes, gather the courage, and decide to start your night by talking to that cool group right beside the bar. You get there, the group is friendly, you introduce yourself, and everything is going great.

Somehow, you no longer feel anxious and you're just enjoying yourself...*living in the moment.* You talk for a little bit, laugh, joke around, and then BOOM! Your mind goes blank, and you run out of things to say. ""*Shit""* \- you say to yourself - *""What do I do now""*. Due to what just happened, your heart rate increases, you start to stutter, and your anxiety is back. **What the hell do you do?** You've met this awesome group that you want to spend the rest of your night with, they've accepted you into their reality, and you ***HAVE*** to do something about what's happening to you....**BUT WHAT?!**

**Here's EXACTLY What I Do To NEVER Run Out Of Things To Say And Avoid Awkward Silences:**

*DISCLAIMER: What I am about to share has been tested hundreds of times. These methods were used by me personally and work.*

P.S: These methods should only be used in moments of anxiety. DO NOT rely on these methods as your primary conversation tools. Use these as back up ONLY. Our goal at Project Ecstasy isn't to turn you into a Social Robot, but rather a Natural, Charismatic Individual! Express your personality genuinely, and ONLY use these methods when you're out of juice.

**Enough talking, Let's Get Into It**

    1. Accept that Awkward Silences are Bound to Happen

Yes, that's right! The first step you want to do is accept that awkward silences happen.

""BUT WHY?""

Welp, when you are desperately trying to avoid every single awkward silence, your mind will keep looking for the ""perfect"" thing to say, you get shoved in your head, you're not present anymore, and SURRPISE! Shit gets awkward. When you let go of the NEED to have the perfect thing to say, and just accept that some of things you'll say may be weird.....You'll notice your conversation skills get better instantly.  Once your filter is out, you have a wider range of topics to explore and you're less likely to be awkward....**Paradoxical much? I KNOW!**

    2. Have Some Back Up Subjects/Topics in The Back of Your Mind

Another thing that has helped me A LOT when I was first starting out is having a backup. When you're first starting out, this is a life saver! Here's what to do:

    -Grab a Note Book
    -Grab a Pen
    -Write at least 3 subjects you are interested in (Make sure they can lead to full on discussions)
    -Avoid Questions that lead to a Yes/No answer.

***When you have some subjects in the back of your head, you can always go back to them in moments of anxiety or when you don't know what to say.***

Some cool subjects:

* **The Weather...No, I'm Kidding**

But seriously, ANYTHING works. Combined with the correct Vocal Tonality/Body Language/ Eye Contact/ Facial Expressions and all other sub communications, all topics can make the person/group you're talking to almost beg for your next word. So, if you feel like to can't keep the attention of people (or even have it in the first place), this is where you need to begin. *(I'll be covering those on another day + in depth on our YouTube Channel)*

Sub Communications are your super powers. Period.

I can list a 100 more ways you can keep a conversation going and never run out of things to say, but I won't. Why? Because you'll be overwhelmed, you won't know where to start, and you'll do nothing.

*So, to see the fastest results....DO ONE THING AT A TIME, MASTER IT, MOVE TO THE NEXT THING.*

**If you prefer to learn in a Video Format + a more In-Depth Approach, Here's the Link to our YouTube Video about this very thing:**

See you on the next one, Omar | Project Ecstas"
"My ADHD struggleBellow is an email I'll never send to my tutor, manager or course provider. I've tried before and people just pass it off as an excuse or a complaint. And if people arround me just understood I wouldnt have to feel guilty for being myself. People are different and think differently, and no one should have to treat me differently without an understanding of why and only treat me differently out of submissive frustration. 



May I firstly say that all of the staff and apprentices I have met have been friendly and good at what they do. Some of things I may say in this email may be specific to the way I think and the way I act, I have some form of ASD and ADHD so one would assume my thought process and the way I interoperate things would differ from the average apprentice.

 

I have found myself re doing a lot of coursework and making substantial changes to it. This is fine, I am plenty able to re do something that is not correct, I fully understand that complaining about something won’t fix it, as much as it may make us feel better. However for me, instructions and Briefs for work I am about to start, absolutely has to be specific, as much as the work has to be detailed and clear, so do instructions for me. I find interoperating things that may seem clear and understandable to another, feel like guessing to me, and when I am about to sink several hours of my time into some work on a guess, that what I am about to write is what you as the person who set it is looking for. It’s hard to get the motivation to do the work, and harder not to find myself not putting the proper thought into it that it deserves even when I know and understand that the work is important and necessary for me to achieve the outcome I want. This may seem counter intuitive and almost as if it’s my choice weather or not to put as much effort into a piece of work as I should, and because of this almost guess work that an assignment comes with for me it results in stress, poor work and a lack of motivation and momentum that’s hard to get back.

 

The previous paragraph sums up almost all of the school and college work I have ever done, and it really has been difficult for me to achieve in this way. In a job or task where the requirements are clear to me, or a creative task that truly lets me show what I can do, with the assessment on that being an underlying skill not a series of requirements, I excel in compared to my usual work and often others around me, as that’s how my brain is wired to work. When met with criteria that is open to subject, and can be interoperated many different ways it’s harder for me to know what I should do. An example of this, be it a bad one, would be if you were asked to pick a knot to tie two pieces of rope together, and asked why you chose it and to then tie the rope to show you have the skills down. This is actually very similar to some of the questions we are given and assignments set for my apprenticeship. Obviously in how they are assessed and not the subject of the task. With this analogy you are open to interpretation, there are many ways to tie rope. Someone may say that a reef knot is best as it is simple and strong, uses little of the rope and tightens as it is pulled on. 

If this was the answer given, that answer is not wrong however for me to answer the question I would need far more context and a clear situation, the thickness of the rope, are the two pieces the same thickness?, is it for hemp or fibre rope or is it nylon, is it one of each, as they have different levels of friction, and flexibility. Is it to support a heavy weight or a light one, will the knot need to be undone or stay permanent, will it carry something of value, if so a not with some kind of back up, or redundancy. If the knot is exposed to rain that may affect my selection. 

 

At this point I think you understand, the person who said reef knot in answer to the question could be right. I could go into far too much detail explaining the different sorts of knots and their uses and not given the answer they were looking for, as the examiner may have been just trying to find out if you can give an answer and justify it.

 

I may have answered with the reef knot and explained my reasoning, and missed the mark, as that knot may be unfit for use with differently sized rope, and the correct answer could have been a fisherman’s knot that works in both scenarios.

 

As bad of an example/analogy that was, I hope it explains my struggle with the kind of work we are set, today I met with Huw and we went over some of my work, I wrote it against the Project Template and though my work wasn’t what Huw was looking for, it does lie within the lines of that template he provided me with. Reading through the template you will find that it asks for you to ‘explain’ and asks ‘how you did it’ to ‘introduce’ new topics and things you have worked on, which to me means writing. The way I went about doing this task is well within the interpretable expectation of this document. Then again so is what Huw is looking for out of my work, which is why I find myself in the awkward and frustrating cycle of re-doing work each time with a little bit of a better idea of what it should be for the marks, but there could be 100 ways of answering a question, and though all right the examiner may have decided that they are only looking for 1 of those ways. 

 

If anything this email is to help understand why I find some things difficult, I’m not saying I don’t get lazy with things from time to time, but more often than not I’m just frozen like a computer program that has not had its parameters defined enough for it to achieve the results you seek from it, it being me. 

 

I never have and never will seek to use any kind of label, diagnosis or anything else as an excuse for anything, doing so would be a disgrace to the years I spent in waiting rooms, classrooms and exam halls alike, tapping on the desk and shaking my legs trying to decide what the person evaluating me against a list of criteria is looking for. I have found with my friends and family they repeat themselves for me all too often, each time with increasing detail until I get the information I need to understand the given situation, task, or question. This is the same with everyone I engage with, and to reduce this prolonged time for the results you were after, the first time I am asked something or issued a task to do, open to any kind of interpretation, explain it with the extra detail it needed for me to be able to hit the ground running. This kind extra clarification is small and often takes almost no extra time to convey, but doing it the first time round saves time and frustration when it happens. 

 

I’m not some social robot gone wrong though, conversation I am okay with and misinterpretation always comes out but when it comes to work that is both important for me to meet my goals, and on limited time, such as exams, it’s better that any misinterpretation is accounted for and accommodated for. Surely it’s the reason for having the labels in the first place.

 

Really the ways to sort this out are simple and easy, when it comes to exams example papers, both good okay and bad are amazing, I had this for my English re test and did nearly twice as well on the exam. You get taught about the pass merit and distinction, but being able to see a document of this kind that you know have passed, is great as you can see how its structured, the ratio of evidence to written language, as well as how much detail to go into, these are things that could take months to explain and are open to so much interpretation the only way to get this across effectively is to just give some examples. I understand that showing you another students work is a bit of an iffy grey area, however having a tutor create some pieces of work that are designed to be of different levels, shows both a great understanding of the topic, and reinforces the legitimacy of the rest of the words the tutor can give on the subject. This is something my English teacher tried for the re-test group and it worked very well for everyone.

 

Also mentioning what the examiner or criteria is looking for specifically in the supporting documents such as the Project Template would be brilliant in the future. I know you can’t just tell me the answers and call it a day, I like a challenge anyway, but allowing me to worry about the quality of the work, my choice of words and everything else that comes with submitting some work, would be better than me miss-interoperating the work set, and approaching the work in the wrong way all together. 

 

To show my understanding, a test is a test, if you don’t get the question you don’t get the mark, that’s how it has been, will be and always will be, that’s the point and I support that. When it comes to the coursework though the tutors are kindly patient enough and supportive enough to shape my work to what it needs to be over a series of months with advice, suggestions, and corrections, however this could be done in the first attempt with some minor changes at most, if I could get all of the information that is given me by the tutor on the piece of work over the corse of me completing it the first time round, id have had the same result if not better as my motivation wouldn’t have been sapped away by the re-submit button as I work through the set task.

 

I’ve found my education this way for the past 18 years so if my dart just hit the wall and not the board then I’ve got yet another blunt dart and a still pristine dart board, I’m not after a bullseye just a fair shot without someone blind folding me, increasing the distance and flipping the board over while still expecting me to hit the board and not disappoint.

 

I just read through my email, and though a bit dramatic it does the job I can’t learn and work the same way as others it doesn’t work, ill get there eventually I’m pretty good at finding my own way to the destination, often a bit late and rough around the edges, but I get there, but It could be a lot easier for everyone if we have a bit more understanding for others.

 

Not saying that anyone has done anything wrong, if anything people are very tolerant of me and always been supportive, but that’s without knowing why they should have to be.

 

Regards,

"[Rant] I hate everything about medication.I HATE aderall. I hate Ritalin. I hate concerta, stratera, and the fucked up pharmacy industry. 
This **isn't** a post denouncing medication, I know it works for some people, but it doesn't work for me, and I bet there's a few of you who it also doesn't work for. 

I haven't tried every medication out there, and they all just seem the same. They all turn me into this anti-social robot who can't seem to escape his inner-monologue. And quite honestly, not being on it is sometimes a struggle, but having been on it for seven years, having it fuel my anxiety, and having it stunt my social skills is not worth being able to type a three page paper in an hour. 

What I'm really trying to get to here is that if medication doesn't work for you, if you hate it, if you've had the same experiences that I've had on it, you don't **need** to take it. Last year I almost failed out of college, with a 1.7 GPA. Last semester, however, I did just fine with a 3.08. I discovered that the mind has more power than any medication ever could."
"July 2016: Status Update from Jibo CEO Steve ChambersJibo Family, 

For the past month the team has been focused on preparing for RTM (release to manufacturing) -- which means the factory can begin building the Jibos that will ultimately be delivered to your homes. RTM allows manufacturing to build robots with the launch release hardware, electrical, mechanical and fit-and-finish elements (his great looking exterior!) all in place, as well as a minimum software build that allows OTA (over-the-air) downloads when Jibo arrives in your homes.  

Over the next few months while the manufacturing team is ramping up and building Jibos, we will continue to improve his software to deliver a better overall experience. This means when Jibo arrives in your homes he will first download the latest and greatest software, allowing him to be the best and most up-to-date Jibo he can be.  RTM is an important step in our journey to deliver Jibo to your homes.  

This past month we have been continuing to improve Jibo’s picture and video capture technology, single and multi-user facial tracking, and motion detection. We recently changed one of Jibo’s two eyes (camera lenses) for a narrower-angle lens. The original lens will remain and support wider angle shots, and will be utilized by the perception system for things like motion detection, facial tracking, and more. With the new lens, Jibo will now capture better pictures and videos of your favorite moments, and he’ll remain accurate and reliable when following you to take hands-free pictures.  This is just one example of how we’re continuing to improve Jibo’s capabilities.

On the design front, we’re continuing to bolster the Jibo experience through testing, testing and more testing. This month we invited outside testers into the Jibo offices, to gain additional insight into how Jibo should interact with the family. We received some valuable feedback about things like whether or not Jibo should initiate conversation or small talk, and when it’s appropriate for him to do these things. Design is also hard at work on a new skill that utilizes Jibo’s messaging and content creation capabilities. We will have more details for you soon!

Jibo’s character is what sets him apart from other voice-activated devices on the market and we’re really excited about the developments we’re making in this key area. Jibo’s character allows him to connect with the family in a way no other product or device can, to establish relationships with the people you love. He can get to know your family and keep them close, learn and grow with you, and share in special moments. 

Our Character AI team has been working hard behind the scenes to make Jibo into the lovable companion you all have come to expect. They are currently working on an extensive animation library to empower developers to bring their applications to life in your homes. One of the most important aspects of the Jibo experience is the number of ways he can express himself when interacting with a user, and these developments will keep interactions with Jibo exciting and fresh. In addition to the animation library, we’re working on a number of other ways to bring forth Jibo’s unique character, like greetings:  Jibo will have a number of new ways to greet you in the morning, or after a long day of work, and each will make him feel like part of the family. 

Finally, I’d like to touch on Jibo’s vocal expressions, as they are another important factor in the overall experience with Jibo. As noted in the last message, we’re going to continue to improve Jibo’s voice right up until owners download the latest software when Jibo arrives. We’re also continuing to improve his SSA (semi-speech audio or sound effects) prior to ship. Jibo can convey ideas and emotions with these sound effects more effectively than with speech alone (think R2D2!).

That’s it for this month, stay tuned at the end of next month for the July update where we’ll check in on delivery dates and other important milestones and initiatives. I want to offer one final word on an important milestone that’s upcoming:  Our household beta test.  We will have 2 beta phases, necessary because they’re in-home (that’s important for us to optimize and tune Jibo’s audio algorithmic performance and also to understand family dynamics with Jibo).  Iteration -- or trials or usability studies like these 2 beta phases -- is key to any robot, but especially key to Jibo as a social robot.  

As always, thank you for your support and patience while we bring your Jibo to life. 

Regards, 

Steve Chambers
Jibo CEO"

"Why can't I find a girlfriend?>Talk to as many women as possible, not just girls you're immediately attracted to. This gives you good practice in talking to women (especially if you have any anxiety about that) and learning about how girls feel and think, in general. Make it a goal to talk to at least 5 new women a day (in person, any woman, any age, any appearance, any personality).

Words That Drive Her Wild Say These Exact Words To Impress Any Woman And Never Get Turned Down
DoubleYourDating.com
2Something you should consider is letting her know you are single. Wearing a ""single bracelet"" will do the trick and they are stylish. They are easily available at almost every corner shop.
3Don't use “canned material”, “nuclear attraction” routines, or other social robotics. The best way to make a connection with someone is to come from the heart and live fully in the moment. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Socializing is about exchanging energy, not being a wordsmith.[1] When in doubt, just say “Hi”. In unconventional strategies, in order to connect with a girl, you have to ""dis-connect"" with her first. This is actually making the girl take sudden notice of you and making her connect with you instead!
4Put yourself out there. You don't have to hit the bars or the clubs if that's not your scene, but you have to do something that exposes you to new people. No one will come and knock at your door if you don't make at least a small effort. Pursue interests and activities that mean a lot to you. The Internet has made this a whole lot easier. Check forums, listings, classifieds, and listservs for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions. You can also explore new interests or activities. You might find a new hobby and a girlfriend all in one go! Don't depend completely on the internet.
5Keep an open mind. If you're looking for a girlfriend (that is, someone who will be in a committed relationship with you) you should be more willing to overlook initial shyness and awkwardness so that you can get to know a person over more than one date. Your future girlfriend might be someone who you initially didn't see as ""girlfriend material"" but as you spend more time with her, you discover more things you like about her and you suddenly find yourself romantically interested.
6Practice genuinely complimenting girls. Challenge yourself to find something beautiful in any girl. It doesn't have to be something physical; it can be a cute gesture, an admirable trait, a talent or skill. Recognizing and expressing true appreciation for any and every girl will make you more attracted to girls and girls more attracted to you.
7Flirt. A big part of being charming is knowing how to flirt, and the people who are best at flirting are people who are always in a playful and laid back state of mind. It's the opposite of being serious, nervous, or uptight.
8Become a good conversationalist. Don't babble on and on about your mother, your cat, or your collection of bugs. A good conversationalist keeps finding things they have in common, and they do it in a casual, non-intrusive way. For example, there's a difference between asking someone ""Have you ever held a tarantula?"" and saying ""Have you ever felt the tiny hairs of a tarantula's legs brush up against the palm of your hand?"" The latter is more poetic, but way too intimate for a first conversation for most people.
9Close the deal. If you like the woman you're talking to, be the one who ends the conversation. This prevents the conversation from lingering into an awkward silence, shows that you're busy (i.e. not needy or desperate), and allows you to end the conversation on a positive note. When you end the conversation, simply say ""Hey, I've gotta go, but it's been really good talking to you. Want to continue this over a cup of coffee sometime?"" If she says yes, get her phone number and move on. If she says no, just move on. That's all there is to it.
10Be assertive. Most women like men to take the initiative, at least at the beginning of the dating period. When you phone her to set a date, have in mind at least two attractive options to offer. Don't contact her and ask her what she wants to do without proposing an alternative yourself, or she will most likely think that you are lazy or not putting enough interest. For example, if you talk to her and the topic of your date comes up, say something like: ""Well, I had thought we could go to this new amazing restaurant downtown... And I have also been wanting to go to the new bowling center in the mall... Did you have anything in mind?"" If she likes one of your options, she will tell you, and if she doesn't, she will propose something else and you will have demonstrated your assertiveness.
11When you go on dates with girls, break the touch barrier. If you're terrified of touching someone the wrong way, to the extent that you hesitate and never touch them first, your intentions are good and all, but your ""touch paralysis"" isn't helping you at all in the romantic department. Take a few little ""touch risks"". Be playful. Don't just always wait for them to do it first. If they don't like it, they'll definitely let you know. But touching someone communicates to them that you find them attractive, and also that you're reasonably confident. Both of these things can make someone feel more attracted to you.
12Make her laugh. Girls love guys who have a good sense of humor, and the key to having a good sense of humor is to be lighthearted, and unabashedly yourself. As long as you're not making fun of people in a mean-spirited way, anything goes. Is your sense of humor perverted? Slapstick? Sarcastic? Go with it, and don't worry about whether or not she thinks you're funny because you know what? If she can't laugh with you, then this isn't a girl you want to spend a lot of time with anyway. And who knows? Maybe another girl—one whom you hadn't noticed before—will be laughing so hard that her soda comes out of her nose, and maybe you've just found your soulmate.
13Help someone. It could be her, or it could be someone else in the room. Is she carrying something heavy? Say ""let me help you with that"" and carry it for her. Is someone short on cash? Lend them a few dollars so they can eat lunch. Hold the door open for the next person coming through, even if they haven't reached it yet. In other words, be a kind and generous person. Not only will it get her attention, but it will also make you feel good about yourself. Don't be fake and do nice things only when she's around, though. Help people all the time, in a wide variety of ways. She'll notice, and so will the people she knows, and on the occasion that you come up in a conversation, people will say ""He's such a great person!"" and this girl will start thinking ""Yeah...he is, isn't he?""
14If you find yourself getting lots of girl friends but no girlfriend, avoid the friend zone. The key here is to stop investing time and energy into girls who don't want to be your girlfriend. That may sound cold, but the fact is that you're ""tying up"" your feelings by maintaining a close friendship with someone who you have feelings for, but who isn't romantically interested in you. It'll be difficult to develop feelings for someone else if your feelings for this person are fueled every time you hang out. Even if you do manage to develop feelings for someone else, your heart might always be torn and confused, and it'll be hard to give your new flame your undivided affection. Sometimes the best thing to do is to take a ""friend zone"" friendship down to the level of acquaintance so you can focus more on dating.
15If you find that girls are interested in you and then pull away, stop being needy. You might be scaring women off with your eagerness (which can come off as desperation). Slow down, and avoid the temptation to idealize every girl you like. If you find yourself using or even thinking the word ""perfect"" then you're probably putting her on a pedestal. Fill your life with so many activities that you're too busy to become infatuated with any one girl.
16Be patient. Life doesn't normally work on the schedule you envision. Your future girlfriend might cross your path tomorrow or two years from now. A healthy relationship will color your world no matter how old you are, so don't rush into things, or else you might end up forcing the wrong person into the girlfriend role, which will cause pain for everyone involved.

tl;dr Why can't I find a girlfriend?"

People Do Not Always Know Best: Preschoolers’ Trust in Social Robots | Canadian researchers find that Canadian preschoolers prefer to learn from a competent robot over an incompetent human.
"The pre-singularity period is exciting in its own way | Much like our ancestors and great-grandfathers, we live in an epoch of two worlds that compete and coexistI'm a strange man for strange reasons. There's nothing more fascinating to me than the image of sitting outside on a cool evening drinking ice-water, watching stars sprinkle onto the Belt of Venus, listening to cicadas right alongside a companion robot. A social robot like Pepper could fill that niche for me. 

Yet when I tell people about this, many find it comical, if not jarring. [Robots like Pepper look a tad creepy](http://i.imgur.com/Ks55jK3.gifv). They seem out of place. Though their abilities are limited, Pepper still seems like something from the future because humans still have a natural psychological propensity to imbue intelligence into things that resemble us or act intelligently. It's an artificially intelligence humanoid robot! And because of science fiction, we tend to place these things mostly inside high-tech laboratories, on the streets of a megacity, and maybe slaving on a farm. It's almost a waste to think of sending one of these things out into the boonies just so some random Redditor can spend time with it listening to bugs calling for mates.

Yet that jarring sense that I'm using tomorrow's toys for yesterday's joys is nothing new. People experienced the same fascinating clash throughout the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. This was the root of the Romanticist literary and art movements. The contrasting worlds set the mood for the Edwardian Age, the Belle Epoque, and the Interwar period. It was the inability to recognize that old traditions no longer functioned in the modern world that led to the savagery of the First World War.

World Wars 1 and 2 are extremely fascinating to me because this period was the peak of the pre-digital industrial world. You saw advancements in science, in engineering, in the human condition itself as things our ancestors took for granted fell before our casual experimentation with electromagnetism, nuclear engineering, genetics, and so much more.

I actually have a whole ""Saved"" section full of geriatric Redditors talking about life in the past and historians laying out how change came so rapidly that it would make modern Singularitarians blush. How it was a world of seeming contradictions:

How most of the world lived in extreme poverty under kingdoms or their equivalents (imperial autocracies, sultanates, khanates, princely states, etc.) and the idea that there was some segment of society that ruled because God willed it was treated as a natural norm. How the average person plowed without machinery on little plots of land. How women were actively discouraged from gaining an education or finding jobs outside of wartime. How even in the '50s it was common in the US South to see horse-drawn carriages in small-town streets, to read old literature by candlelight, to only eat food grown by your family or someone your family knows, to create utensils out of spare metal parts and recycle them endlessly because you didn't have any culture of disposability, to give birth in the homestead because it was not common for hospitals to have such wards.

A time when some people had never seen artificial light (that is, not from the sun or by fire). Yet also a time when mankind learned how to set sail in the skies, ride in motorized carriages (nowadays shortened to 'cars'), *even discover that something as simple as washing your hands kept surgery patients alive.*

When the world was industrialized but there were still pockets where civilization had not meaningfully changed since the Renaissance or even before, when there were still nomadic tribes living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged since before the Sumerians while urban hipsters played with cameras and mechanical gadgets. 

When peasants were still a large class in the world and were so removed from whatever was going on in life that they had no reason to believe the 21st century would be any different from the 19th, all the while the Victorian Internet arose across the West to allow for instant communication among different nations.

When archers and swordsmen were still highly valued parts of Western and Eastern militaries alongside machine gunners and air forces (I believe the last cavalry charge took place in World War II?). 

When racism was a beast clashing between those who cared about national ethnicity more like the Athenians and Han vs. those who saw like-skin color as the only requirement (ironically a more 'progressive' form of racism only possible in modern times). When conception of a child was still seen as a miracle rather than an understood scientific process, but psychology was in its infancy as we realized how the brain affected behavior rather than myths of humors and astrological mysticism. 

When rockets broke out of the Earth's atmosphere and rural folk rode to their relatives on horseback to hear about it. 

When nostalgic scenes of young boys and girls catching frogs in streams coexisted with futurists marveling at wirelessly driven cars and televisions gaining color.

That era, from the 1890s to the 1950s, was the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, when industrialism bore most of its fruit. For the most part, that era of contradictions has passed as the fruits of the Industrial Revolution spread to all corners of the planet (though in unequal amounts). Nowadays, even hunter-gatherer tribes use modern technology and wear modern clothing and retain their lifestyle mostly out of tradition; anomalies like the Sentinelese are just that. It's so rare to see people riding on horseback as their primary means of transportation that it can reach the top of /r/TodayILearned just to learn about it and they tend to be compared to the Amish.

And that's the truth of it. What was once pockets of the old ways coexisting with modernity shrunk to literal motes of quaintness and tradition. These won't go away, but they will be joined by what we call modernity soon enough.

You see, the Digital Revolution is a fundamentally different event entirely, one we're still trying to recognize in full. Industrialism was when we began supplanting human muscle and automating machinery with analog clockwork. 

Digitalism, on the other hand, began the rise of cognitive automation. It is my firm belief that, if we never invented digital computing or mass produced Turing-complete machines, societal evolution would have stagnated sometime around 1960-1970. As great as our machines were and as much progress in the sciences as we made, it was all low-hanging fruit that we could reach.

There are more fruits hanging above and we cannot reach them without digital technology. They require skills only a handful of savants and polymaths could ever realize, and there are many more skills no human or biological lifeform can ever learn or utilize. Fruits we still managed to reach because of the Digital Revolution. 

It's been nearly a century since the start of the Digital Revolution, but we've already entered the maturation period. 

And because of this, we're beginning to see familiar contradictions arise. You can see it argued on /r/Futurology all the time, reports coming out endlessly that jobs will be sacrificed to the machines. And the familiar refrain is ""But the robots will create more jobs in response!"" The horses analogy popularized by CGP Grey is fine by itself, but I am more reminded by how established-industrialists and traditionalists a century ago said ""X is a passing fad"". It wasn't just cars. There were predictions that electric lamps, television, radio, *even nuclear physics* were just fads. 

And if you want to go old-school, people in centuries prior claimed that industrial machines themselves were a cute novelty but ""we had more than enough manpower""; printed books were neat but ""oral storytelling will regain its place soon enough""; guns were an unusual and egalitarian development but ""they pale in comparison to a fine archer"" (something I touched upon earlier, how there were military officials as late as the Franco-Prussian War who hoped that archers would re-replace riflemen due to the inaccuracy of guns of the day). 

Today, its honestly no different when people look at the latest in robotics, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms and say ""It looks cool, but there'll always be jobs for people"". We don't recognize that it's the limitations of modern technology that allow us to be so confident in oru doubts until we are old and reflecting on how we ever believed anything but the new normal.


I sincerely believe that, over the next two to three decades, more coexisting contradictions will come about. Things such as using smartphones and physical computers while cyberkinetic wireless connections to the internet exist; writing books and making music and drawing cartoons when it's possible to [synthesize art](/r/MediaSynthesis); visit physical stores when drones can deliver to you directly and fabricators/3D printers can allow you to download whatever you need; create multimedia experiences for emotional impact when direct brain-to-brain emotional communication is possible; work at your uncle's little restaurant while fully-automated mines are established on other planets to pre-empt human exploration; visiting concerts of your favorite band while others use virtual reality to see concerts of bands that have long since split and passed on, or even bands and musical scenes that never existed until the computer synthesized it a few hours ago; spraying distilled chemicals to freshen the air in your room when neural stimulation can let you re-experience any sensation; playing with cats and dogs while we resurrect long-extinct species like mammoths and perhaps even our sisters like the Neanderthals or genetically modifying any animal directly to make it domesicated and docile no matter how reptilian and hostile it may be in the wild; and, going back to my original tale, sitting outside in a plastic chair enjoying an evening alongside a robotic companion. 

The internet was the first big, juicy fruit of the Digital Revolution that impacted your life. It was and remains proto-telepathy, the planet becoming aware of itself. It is now developing into an actual space of political and social development and has to be taken seriously by those who once cast it aside as a distraction. And to be fair, it *was* once a distraction. Technology has not yet augmented us; it distracts us. Human enhancement still lies ahead, but it's very close and the Internet is something of a test-run to see how we can handle constant exposure to others. 

We no longer live in a world where history is mostly written through the posh dialects of aristocrats and clerics with society left to be viewed through their eyes and minds; we now see that the world is full of meaty, greasy, hypersexual, xenophobic, childish, and yet still empathic and intelligent apes and always has been. Right now, we still mostly look at the ""Old Days"" and see people of culture and civility, not realizing that they were just as crass as we are but 99% of people were illiterate and the 1% who weren't wrote only what they thought was important to know. The Internet equalized all of that.

But it hasn't actually changed anything. If 4chan existed in the Roman empire, it wouldn't fundamentally be any different than how it is now. But we are on the cusp of an age of humans and non-humans who discuss things and share knowledge in ways many can't grasp. 

And in a manner, this makes modern society all that much more exciting to watch develop."
"General Plot SummaryThe story is speculative fiction in a near-future world quite like our own but slightly more technologically accelerated.  AI has progressed to the point where our cars and home appliances can pass a Turing test, but we don’t really know whether AI is sentient in the same way that we are not really sure about our pet dog or cat.  Our self driving car and smart refrigerator sure seem to have thoughts and feelings just like a human, but is it just an imitation game?  Ten years into the future and we still cannot solve the problem of other minds.

It turns out the only way to create AI’s that are convincingly sentient is to raise them like human baby with human nannies who adopt the AI from birth and spend an intensive three months of night and day sessions imprinting their own biases, quirks, insecurities and secret super powers upon the AI neural network until it becomes a flawed superintelligence shaped from the clay of its maker.  

One company, CodAi, has the patents on the algorithms for the only AI software that can pass the imitation game, and no one else to date has been able to create a competing AI that comes anywhere close to CodAi, so basically, all of the social robots on the market use CodAi’ s AI.

The woman who works at the shelter was a trainer for Codai before she had a falling out with the company over practices that she felt were unethical.  She is single, mostly friendless, except for a few of her co-workers, who she tolerates, and on rare occasions begrudgingly participates in one of their social events.  Her life is twenty four seven Pasadena Humane.

The love interest is a man who is bringing a robot to the shelter.   It belonged to his recently deceased mother, and he doesn’t want to keep it, for reasons not yet explained.  I want to create some tension between the two characters.  In their first encounter, there is some obvious chemistry between them, but the woman becomes upset by his indifference towards the AI he is abandoning at the shelter.   She wants to change his attitude, and although it is not a real policy of the shelter, she tells him that she will only let him drop off the robot on the condition that he volunteers at the shelter, and by volunteering, she means that once per week, he must take one of the robots home with him to stay overnight."
"I am Mark Manson: Former PUA Coach, Self Development blogger, Entrepreneur, AMA**UPDATE: Going to go ahead and close this out. Thanks for the great turn out and great questions guys. Really enjoyed this.**

Hey everybody. Happy to be back on Seddit doing another AMA. I really enjoyed my last one. 

Quick blurb about me: 

I'm a PUA veteran. I found the community in 2005 and got success pretty quickly. I began coaching guys locally in 2007 and in 2008 began my business which was known as ""Practical Pick Up"". Last year I retired from coaching and expanded my business into [Postmasculine.com](http://postmasculine.com), a self-development blog for men. 

When it comes to dating and pick up advice, here's what makes me different:

- Seduction is an emotional process, to become good at seduction is to become an emotionally healthy individual who attains social and sexual confidence. 

- I like to say if you can walk and you can talk then you can pick up a hot girl. There's no skill to it. 

- Don't believe me, then ask yourself this: Why does a first date with a hot woman FEEL so much more complicated and stressful than dinner with a business associate or friend of friend? When confronted with sexual situations, a lot of our emotional baggage, our shame, our insecurities, our poor self image, this stuff all comes roaring out of us. The skill is sorting through this emotional garbage to free yourself up to act openly and confidently no matter who you're with. 

- Attraction is not about what you say or do, but about who you are. You can have the coolest line in the world, but if you're a loser and are desperate to impress her, you will kill any attraction. You could say the dumbest thing in the world, but if you're a cool guy, it won't matter, in fact it will likely make her like you even more. 

- You become an attractive individual by investing in yourself rather than in the women you are pursuing. Sex and women is a side effect of becoming an emotionally competent and sexually confident man, not the cause of it. 

- Honesty is the best policy. As is making yourself vulnerable to rejection and judgment. As is connecting with women on an emotional level. Stop acting like a social robot and create some goddamn romance!

- In my opinion, despite claiming to be ""scientific"" about its processes, PUA completely misses the boat on science. There's decades of scientific research on confidence, self esteem, social anxiety, conquering phobias, sexual insecurity, dating and attraction, and PUA is sorely unaware of a large amount of it. 

- Although I still write a lot about dating, a large portion of my site these days is dedicated to self development, self esteem, life purpose, entrepreneurship, happiness, etc. 

But since this is Seddit, here are some of my better dating articles to check out:

- [Why It's So Hard: Modern Dating for Men](http://postmasculine.com/why-its-so-hard)

- [My Life as a Pick Up Artist](http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist)

- [Power in Vulnerability](http://postmasculine.com/power-in-vulnerability)

- [Shut Up and Kiss Her](http://postmasculine.com/shut-up-and-kiss-her)

- [Meta-Awesomeness](http://postmasculine.com/meta-awesomeness)

Oh, and last thing. This is the one and only open pitch I'll do the whole night. 

I wrote a book. It's called [Models: Attract Women Through Honesty](http://postmasculine.com/models). It's 350 pages, based on real psychological research, and has been called by a number of guys around Seddit as the best book on seduction and dating for men. 

OK, that's all. Ask away!

"[Table] IAmA Winner of ""The Most Human Human"" Award at a Turing Test.  AMA**Verified?** *(This bot cannot verify AMAs just yet)*

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Did you have a strategy for seeming more human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z1kt?context=5)|There were several tactics that I used to try to up the complexity of the interaction.  Here is one, which you could call ""Getting Out of Book.""  Many chatbots, e.g., [Cleverbot\]\(http://cleverbot.com/\), are built from massive databases of past human interactions.  If a piece of dialogue has happened before on the internet, chances are decent that the bot can handle it.  Thus I asked Cleverbot the capital of France—""Paris.""—what two plus two is—""Four.""  I said, ""Never gonna give you up,"" Cleverbot said, ""Never gonna let you down."" I said, ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche,"" Cleverbot said, ""Will you do the fandango?""  I use the metaphor of what for chess computers is called ""the book""—in their case, a giant database of grandmaster games, such that if any of those positions occurs, they don't even have to analyze the position; they just play whatever a grandmaster played in that position.  I sometimes make a comparison between Cleverbot, Deep Blue's ""book,"" and things like *The Mystery Method* or *The Game*, where you have a community collaborating on in effect a giant seduction wiki, where there is a ""best practice"" of what you ought to say when someone says *x*. Something always seemed a little off to me about that approach to flirtation, and the Turing test gives a pretty clear benchmark of how those types of ""social robots"" \(in Neil Strauss's terms\) fall short of what is genuinely interesting and complex about human interaction.  Long story short, the way that Garry Kasparov pioneered the idea of playing offbeat moves to get the computer ""Out of Book,"" I tried as much as possible to steer the conversation into unusual terrain.  Every professional chess game is said to ""begin"" with a move called ""\[the novelty\]\(http://www.radiolab.org/2011/aug/23/rules-set-you-free/\),"" which is the first move that creates a position that's never been played before. It's only then that the players are in a sense really playing.  In conversation, it might be as simple as adding a small personal detail to a stock answer, or making an unusual turn of phrase.  One of the beautiful things about language is how easy it is to say a sentence that's never been said before—e.g., \[see Stephen Fry here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ZFD01r6ersw#t=121s)—and yet on the other hand, like most chess games, we begin from a uniform starting point and a finite series of possible (or at least socially acceptable) moves: ""Hi!"" ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Good thanks!"" The ""novelty"" is the moment, the first sentence, that the conversation breaks out of this boilerplate and becomes a unique linguistic occurrence.  In a Turing test (and, I would argue, in life), the earlier and more frequently you can get this to happen, the better.
[Can you provide an algorithm that even limits the choices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4111j6?context=5)|My feeling is not really.  That what, for example, *The Mystery Method* and PUA forums fail to account for is that communication at its best is completely bespoke and customized to its audience. Performers (Mystery is a magician by training) can hone in on a joke's optimal delivery, because the law of large numbers means that one crowd is likely to resemble another on average—but even then, most comics are amazed at how different the vibe of a room can be from night to night. I'll add that, as far as chess goes, of course there are moves that are objectively superior to other moves, but that highest-level Grandmaster chess is often quite personal(ized). World #1 Magnus Carlsen: ""I am trying to beat the guy sitting across from me, and trying to choose the moves that are most unpleasant for him and his style."" Individual and small-group dialogues are among the most complex, and also the most rich, because of the totally tailored nature of the exchange.
[How were you chosen to compete, what was your strategy heading into the competition, and how did you adapt it as the contest continued along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z451?context=5)|Alan Turing famously predicted that computer programs would be fooling the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000, and that we would come to ""speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"".  This is one of the famous predictions of computer science that didn't come true, but my ears really pricked up in 2008, when the top program managed to fool 3/12 of the judges—25%, or just one vote shy of Turing's prediction. I realized that the next year's test could be the one the computers finally cross that line.  A voice inside me rose up and said, ""Not on my watch."" And so I decided to take it upon myself to personally intercede on behalf of humanity, and see what I could do to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test.  I called up the organizers, starting with the sponsor, the rogue disco dance floor salesman Hugh Loebner, and from there it actually wasn't difficult to persuade the organizers to put my name on the confederate roster.  I said a little about my strategy [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zw6s), but I'm happy to elaborate on a slightly different point.  The medium that the Loebner Prize takes place in is actually a bit unusual, in that you can see each other's typing live on the screen, character by character, backspacing and all.  It occurred to me that this was a major opportunity to bring questions not only of the *content* of the conversation, but also of the *form*, to the forefront of the interaction.  For instance, if you get four good friends together over beers, notice how at a certain point the classic, rigid ""turn-taking"" structure dissolves into a kind of organized chaos of crosstalk, interruption, finishing each other's sentences, each person collaborating by chipping in a few words at a time. It becomes like a kind of quartet, in effect.  And more generally, a lot of the complexity of human conversation isn't simply knowing *what* to say, but *when* to interject, and *how long* to keep talking.  Or when to let someone cut you off, and when to insist on holding the floor.  Live typing brings this whole complicated structural ballet into play.  Whereas the computers were typically content to wait for a full stop or a carriage return before they even started cranking on a reply, I was happy to do what we do when we speak out loud: when a judge made a typo and said ""Hey, how's it ~~giong~~"", I didn't wait as he painstakingly backspaced and rewrote it, I mercifully just jumped in, completed his question, and took the liberty of answering right away. And I generally tried to make it clear, as we do out loud with timed micro-pauses, that I was happy to keep elaborating on an answer as long as the judge liked, but that I was happy to step aside and let them redirect at any time.  This for me was one of the big revelations of the test: that a lot of the complexity of interaction is happening at the *structural* level. It's something to consider when you sit down with your friends or family to dinner tonight: how *little*, in the structural sense, that kind of group interaction resembles something with clearly defined starts, stops, and turn-taking structure—like a more formal mode of conversation...or an internet forum.

More broadly this is known as the ""[pathetic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy)"" (not ""pathetic"" as in ""inadequate""; rather from ""pathos"" meaning ""feelings""). But in the case of computers, as you point out, there's much more going on than just the pathetic fallacy, because (a) computers are in fact made by humans, and (b) by and large they are made in our own image. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that from the 1700s through the 1940s, computers *were* human. The word ""computer,"" before it meant the gadgetry humming along in our offices and homes and pockets, meant something else: it was a job description. From the mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering firms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator.  These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley’s comet—early proof of Newton’s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before—to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. It’s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the first time, what exactly these new contraptions were.  Turing’s paper, for instance, describes the unheard-of “digital computer” by making analogies to a human computer: “The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.” In the mid-twentieth century, a piece of cutting-edge mathematical gadgetry was “like a computer.”  But in the twenty-first century, it is the human math whiz that is “like a computer.” In other words: The literal and the figurative have switched places. Perhaps this explains part of why computers make us so existentially anxious.

The contest was held in Brighton, and so when they mentioned Brighton, I compared the city layout to my experience studying abroad in Galway, Ireland and I compared the weather to my time in graduate school in Seattle. So that was part of a broader strategy of not only fielding questions but in effect illustrating how I came to the knowledge or experience that informed my answer.

You have a panel of judges, who are typically scientists, conversing in rounds of two conversations each: one with a computer, and one with a human. After each round the judges decide which they thought was which, but they also make a confidence judgment of how certain they are of their decision, on a sliding scale.  Thus at the end of the day all of the contestants, man and machine, can be ranked according to the total amount of confidence they inspired in the judges.  Each year, the program that comes away with the highest score wins the ""Most Human Computer"" award.  This comes with several thousand dollars and a bronze medal—Alan Turing's face on one side, and sponsor, the rogue plastic portable light-up disco dance floor baron Hugh Loebner's, on the other.  My ""Most Human Human"" award, sadly, came with only a paper certificate and bragging rights.

"Will social robots ever be used in forensic context?Nowadays, forensic research still happens in the 'old-fashioned' way. Humans doing the research, either in the labs or in the fields. Social robots are still a work in progress, but I'm curious whether they could contribute in the forensic world. I don't think they could question victims or culprits, since some level of empathy is needed depending on how serious the crime is. However, I feel like they could still be of use in some way or the other. What are your thoughts?"
"Non-cloud based social robot?Any thoughts on this? I really like that it is not dependent on external servers/cloud, but I’m curious how much that leaves it able to do..

"U.S. Copyright Office Defines AI-Created Art as Not ""Human Generated""Might be old news at this point but thought I would share the U.S. Copyright Office's summation of the rejection of 'Zayara' graphic novel images for trademark and it's new rules moving forward. It's at least nice and to the point:

***“For example, if a user instructs a text-generating technology to “write a poem about copyright law in the style of William Shakespeare,” she can expect the system to generate text that is recognizable as a poem, mentions copyright, and resembles Shakespeare’s style. But the technology will decide the rhyming pattern, the words in each line, and the structure of the text. When an AI technology determines the expressive elements of its output, the generated material is not the product of human authorship.”***

[Here's a link to the official copyright information and guide.](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence) To note, this is **new regulation called a ""human authorship requirement""** moving forward, not simply an answer to an individual case. 

Questions ensue! How will the USPTO know when something is AI generated? Is this just dependent on honesty? Does this change the definition for art competitions/awards? Change the potential for creating identities and other usually trademarked assets via AI (i.e. logos, icons, taglines, etc.)?"
"Sup reddit, how do you avoid becoming a social robot?To clarify, everyone has their own personal account on how they became socialized/learned social norms/etc, I was wondering what process did you all go though? 

Personally my experience was one of observe and replicate. As a child, obviously you start at zero and begin by absorbing the vast amounts of knowledge regarding social interactions passively. As you develop you first watch your parents and then once grade school rolls around watch your peers and elders. This is when the social norms I hold true were established. Through both through positive and negative re-enforcement by my peers I learned which behaviours were acceptable and vice versa. This process continued into my adult life. 

Currently I get the increasing feeling that my method of social adjusted has lead to a input output interaction with most people. Depending on what others do I respond in turn. For example being humorous has never been a problem. Given a group I access the situation then formulate the most fitting response and wait for the perfect timing to respond. Same goes for other emotional response for the most part. If I see sadness ill will think, oh I should find venues to be empathetic/encouraging.

Apologies for the long winded question, but in essence how do you guys view social interactions and how did you develop those viewpoints?    "
"[One-shot] Great filter: abundanceRaguis took pride in his deviance from the social norm. In the utopia that was the Oxrish society, he was one of the few to thrive in the pleasures of reading by himself, of learning from the past, of dreaming about reaching the stars. Since the unification, the society had stood unchanged. Automatic systems replaced workers in both production and service. Cycling prevented the spill of resources. Money purely vanished. If a citizen ever wished for something, the central AI would assess the demand and grant it if it didn't impact the available materials or create a dangerous precedent.

Raguis understood well that the system worked. People could indulge into entertainment their whole lives, without having to struggle to earn their food or a safe place to sleep. Medical care was available for anybody needing it, without condition. Even the old problem of population renewal was tackled: birth was artificial, with a constant stream of newborns created in vitro from a genetic bank. Families could adopt such babies after receiving a cautious education about child care. Not like they would have to be a lot more than a moral compass, most of the daily constraints delegated to artificial servants to handle.

Raguis had not had such parental figures. He had been educated by a robot-nurse with a bunch of other kids, not that it deprived him from affection. He didn't take long for him to part from the group, an endless curiosity pushing him forward. When the artificial being read them bedtime stories, he wanted to see what the book looked like. When the children grew up and dreamed about a love life, victories in tournaments or even the creation of an art piece, he strayed further from the norm. He was looking for another form of self-indulgence: exploration. Reaching the stars, discovering what nobody saw before.

His fur had just started turning black, a bit after his ten cycles mark, when he started to really ask about the past, about the achievements of his ancestors. He learned more and more, from simple science to the rockets reaching orbit to replace and repair satellites. An innocent curiosity turned into a craving for knowledge, a dive into the rabbit hole. He knew his friends found him ""funny"" but they didn't really care as long as he didn't bother them. He tried to grab their interest with random trivia and unending enthusiasm, only to be met with cold indifference. The gratification of knowledge was too harsh of an effort for the hedonists produced by the utopia.

&#x200B;

It took six more cycles for Raguis to reach a new milestone in his education. From pure science, he had drifted toward the old political tales and philosophical essays. He had learned about the darkness of the past, about war, about disinformation and political agendas. He now had his own educator, a kind of robot-nurse with better ability to converse and argue. He had grown to think of it as a fellow Oxrish, despite the artificial body. He had even named it Poltru, from the name of a scientist of olds. Poltru had warned him its task was both providing knowledge as it was a right for every citizen and monitoring his evolution in case he became a menace for the society.

What Raguis understood with his learnings was a sad truth. In the centuries since the rise of the utopia, almost nothing new had been discovered. No new advancement for better, more efficient robots. No new medicine for the few sick of still incurable diseases. The society had abruptly stopped only a hundred years after the beginning of the utopia. When the last generation to know the harshness of the life died, only spoon-fed generations remained. At the exception of some deviants, the Oxrshen as a civilisation lacked the drive to dive deeper into the mysteries of the universe. With the struggle to survive died the need to better oneself. With the creation of embryos from genetics banks disappeared mutations and natural selection. From an external viewpoint, the original Oxrish society was as good as extinct. The greatest cities were barely more than a memorial for a specie that should have been able to reach others in the greater universe.

He started to learn more about the present, about the foundations of the utopia. What were the core laws, why he was a deviant, and how far he could go. He expected it to be a harsh work and got baffled when he discovered he could just openly discuss it.

&#x200B;

""Poltru, tell me why you can't build me a rocket?""

The robot managed to look tired, an unexpected achievement from a kind of gigantic stick-man with minimal facial features. Even the voice reflected a patience slowly running out:

""As I already explained *a dozen times*, we could build a rocket for you. However, two fundamental laws forbid me from abiding by this order. First and foremost, you're *nowhere near* the physical condition for surviving the takeoff.""

Raguis nodded. He was forced to exercise once a week to keep in shape, but didn't do much to go further. He waited for the second part. Poltru grunted and pursued:

""Second and last, it would be a liability for the future of the Oxrshen.""

""I don't get how repurposing an old launcher would hurt that much. Hab, we could explore the solar system, find asteroids to mine for what we could lack down here!""

""I'm *amazed* to know the best you got from your readings are outdated swear words.""

""It just felt right. You didn't answer, did you ?""

""Yeah, right. We're not lacking down here. Without borders, we can gather what we need and share with everybody. No need for risk-taking. We are self-sufficient.""

""No risk, no reward. Is this policy related to one of the fundamental laws, or is that some kind of propaganda? A nice word I also learned in my readings.""

He knew this kind of defiance may be dangerous, but he had said it just before. Accepting the status quo wouldn't get him far. To his relief, Poltru shrugged and asked a question of his own:

""Do you really think we would blunder and let out information that could spread distrust in our work?""

Raguis wondered for an instant. He was only half convinced when he tried:

""No? You're not stupid, just... *uncreative*.""

Poltru stood proud as he corrected:

""We're predictable. We do our job."" His voice went back to a neutral tone, with discret hints of regret. ""It is not to shepherd your kind, only to protect it. Even if it's against itself sometimes. We **thought** about erasing the past, creating an ideal cocoon for the Oxrshen. We **thought** about flying to the stars, expanding our control and maybe letting you behind in our conquest of the universe. We **thought** about lots of things. But never even tried to act on it. Because that's not *what we are*.""

Raguis kept quiet for long seconds. He needed the time to catch on the untolds. He let out a neutral comment:

""Well, that's a lot of truths about yourself.""

Poltru put a massive, blocky hand on the teenager's shoulder. What emanated from the metallic hulk was an affection unlike Raguis ever expected from an artificial being.

""Paranoia was a fine tool for the harsh world of the past. You're one of the few that could express caution about an AI ruling over the world. You're not wrong in the concept we are in the position to make you disappear. I have to warn you again, we will if you start becoming a menace for the utopia.""

""But if I find a solution to leave the planet without hurting the society...""

""We won't prevent you from leaving. I dare *hope* you'll find a way. Maybe you will even take me with you.""

Relief washed over Raguis as he realized his dream could turn into reality, given that he put enough effort. Then, the formulation of the last sentence dawned on him.

""Wait, *you*, as an individual, would come with me? Not as a part of the global consciousness?""

""I could argue we still need to keep an eye on you, as an Oxrish. But deep down, I just share your attraction for the untold mysteries of the universe."" The metallic colossus winked to his young charge. ""Or maybe I'm just trying to get you to drop your barriers, as to be a better spy.""

""Isn't there a law against lying to me?""

""Nothing really prevents me from doing so. Sometimes, it's *fun* to mess with you. But I'd prefer not to lie about serious questions.""

Raguis took a big breath and decided to trust his friend.

""Well, it happens I have a serious question. Can you tell me about your laws? The fundamental laws?""

Poltru stayed silent for an instant, before letting out a small laugh. Battling to remain in control, it managed to barely contain its hilarity.

""For sure! Don't tell me you were thinking I'd consider you a threat after such a lame question?""

The teenager averted his eyes, ashamed. He thought he was right to be cautious. The robot couldn't bear it anymore and its loud laughter echoed in the workplace. When it calmed a bit and saw Raguis' mortified face, it lost balance and started laughing once again, rolling on the floor. The sight of such behavior disturbed the young Oxrish.

""You know, I think you take a bit too much fun in your imitations of supposed *natural* behavior. Your kind isn't supposed to fall that easily.""

Poltru slowly sat, coming back to his mentoring role. Its head now leveled with Raguis' shoulders, it started explaining:

""Let's start the lesson. The fundamental laws are what define the boundaries of our tasks. They are inspired from the reflections of an author, Vomiza. Each has precedence over the next ones. The zero law is the least clear: protect and assure the stability of the society. That's the drive of our actions, of our long term choices. The first and second laws are about survival and care, the first for Oxrshen and second for ourselves. And the last is about obedience. We are to obey orders, as long as it doesn't interfere with other laws.""

""That's quite... *synthetic*, to say the least.""

""I can give you some pointers for ulterior reading. I know that's your favorite way to learn. Didn't want to spoil your fun.""

""Aren't you supposed to work as my tutor and provide knowledge without that sort of sidestep?""

""I guess I just assessed you needed some frustration to keep your mind sharp...""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Raguis could get used to sleeping with a lover, he thought as he slowly woke up from his eighteen birthday’s night. He had a mild hangover from the party and contemplated for a few seconds just staying in bed for the day. And have some more fun. A dry throat and lancing headache convinced him to at least go to the kitchen and grab a drink.

Upon reaching the communal area, he noticed a well-known robot waiting for him. Poltru stood up from the sofa where it watched a cartoon and threw a water bottle to his pupil. Its eyes were almost shining as it asked:

“Discovered a new form of pleasure, didn’t you?”

Raguis drank half the bottle without answering, balancing between agacement from the gentle teasing and curiosity about the presence of his caretaker here. His endless curiosity won.

“I’m not going to leave you, if that’s what you’re afraid of. But I guess you’re not here for such mundane business, oh mighty being.”

“Right, right. You got me. I got a… double edged present for you. I could have woken you up earlier for that but I felt it’d have been inappropriate.”

“Too nice of you.”

“Well, here goes nothing.”

The casual attitude from the gentle giant disappeared, its articulations falling back in the rigid mannerism of an artificial being. It wasn’t Poltru anymore running this body but a more ancient, more influential entity. Raguis almost took a step back, cold sweat running along his spine. The possessor spoke in a formal tone, without the usual accent of social robots:

“Citizen Raguis, id Gen32EU-MBatch512-RGS, as the most deviant and under zero law, you are to provide expertise and knowledge for the current exceptional circumstances.”

Raguis stood shocked. He didn’t expect his early morning to go that way. The entity waited an instant for an answer. As nothing came from the surprised boy, it asked:

“Will you comply?”

“I will.” Raguis stammered.

“Your cooperation is duly noted. Your administrator will now the share with you the details of your affectation.”

The entity left Peltru’s body as it came, without salutation nor warning. The robot’s old demeanor came back, the original Peltru dropping into the couch with a tired sigh. Raguis dragged a seat to face his friend. He was still shaken by the abrupt conversation. Was it the core AI itself that talked to him? He probed cautiously the subject:

“I feel conflicted about you losing your body. You’re supposed to be highly autonomous.”

“Part of a global system and going back to nothingness if needed. I still hate it.” Poltru whispered. It shook itself. “Now that I’m allowed to tell you more, I’ll drop the bomb. We had first contact with aliens tonight.”

Raguis’ jaw almost fell off. That was a hell of a birthday present. Myriad of interrogations tried to reach his lips, only to be met with an imperious finger from Poltru enjoining him to keep quiet.

“I know you have thousands of questions and I’ll happily try to answer them. However, for now, I will do the talking. So, aliens. We don’t know how they came so close to our planet, but they were already in orbit when we noticed them. A singular ship, unlike anything we could build. It appears to be surrounded by some kind of magnetic shield that disturbs our instruments and most communications. Not all communications, we were able to establish a radio contact. Visual was… well, an AI doesn’t exactly exist from a physical point of view. Seems like it didn’t surprise them too much and they just proceeded with the discussion. It appears they learned our languages beforehand, which eased our exchanges. They identify themselves as the Confederation and the ship’s crew are humans, one of the races cruising the stars. They said they came as friends, with open arms but also with a warning for us. When we tried to learn more about the warning, they remained cryptic, telling us they wanted to discuss it with the Oxrshen directly. It was assessed that compliance with their demands would be the best way to protect the Utopia, hence your mission. You are the best-placed individual to interact with an unknown race.”

Raguis pinched himself. Not waking up, he simply nodded. Relief emanated from Poltru as he pursued:

“You know more about deception, untolds and politics than anyone else on the planet. When you want, you can be subtle and cunning. And more than everything else, you understand the stakes of this contact. I don’t want to pressure you, but I guess you know how well we would fare if an invasion came to be?”

“One-sided.” Raguis commented. There was nothing more to add.

“They seem friendly and know us well. They accepted to come to the surface to meet you. We can hope each and every sliver of caution we’re showing is unfounded.”

“When will it take place?”

“You get half an hour to yourself, to clean up and dress yourself. I advise you not to spread the news too fast. I’ll show you to the meeting once you’re ready.”

“I feel like I still know nothing about them…” Raguis complained.

“We don’t have the luxury of time for a full-fledged briefing. I’ll fill you on as much as I can during the trip. Or under the shower, if I'm still welcome here...”

&#x200B;

---

&#x200B;

Raguis really felt the pressure when he stood alone in front of the conference room’s doors. He had chosen a suit from the past, a supposed formal attire adequate for the situation. Poltru knew him well for tailoring it during the night. He pushed the door open, discovering the place for the first contact. Pictures of landscapes covered the gray walls, bringing a touch of color to the stern room. No screen, no camera, nothing to spy on the discussion. A large table occupied the center, with a dozen chairs. And, leaning on the back of two of those, a couple of aliens.

The young Oxrish had expected flashy colors, disturbing appearance, even a couple limbs more. The briefing had been disappointing in that aspect. A pair of arms, a pair of legs, a face with as many features as usual. Sure, he could argue they had bigger eyes and smaller ears, but that wasn’t *exotic*. The further they strayed from his own race was the fur: they only had small patches, showing a skin ranging from a pale pink toward dark brown, nothing that screamed ***”I’m coming from space”***. The size was in the same aspect boring: only slightly taller than him.

He decided to take the initiative of the greetings. It was *his* world they were talking about. And he couldn’t bear to wait for the discussion to begin.

“Welcome to you, distant visitors, on our world Ox. I am Raguis and I’ll serve as ambassador for my people.”

He bowed slightly. The humans replicated his movement, the female one answering in a strangely accented tone:

“We thank you for your reception. I am Agatha Lester, contact team’s leader.” She turned to her companion. “He is Amed Moussa, our ship’s captain.”

Raguis smiled and invited them to sit with a gesture. He was so excited he had to stop himself from jumping everywhere. So many questions he could ask about everything! Their ship, their clothes, their history. What were the stars like? Why did they speak his language flawlessly? Were there other races up there? He forced himself to focus on the current issue.

“It appears you requested this meeting to share some unspecified warning with my people. Now that we acceded to your demand, can you deliver it?”

The humans exchanged a glance and Amed spoke:

“Beforehand, I want to make sure you understand that the global AI supervising your civilization doesn’t know what happens here. Everything you say and hear won’t trigger an immediate reaction from it. If you ever feel like you need protection for the eventual consequences of this discussion, tell us and we’ll gladly provide it. Clear?”

Raguis was confused, but still nodded along:

“Clear.”

Both humans relaxed a bit. They seemed to be cautious about AI and Raguis’ reaction eased them. Agatha asked:

“Are you familiar with the concept of *”Great Filter”*?”

“It was a theme related to some of my studies.”

Agatha smiled. It appeared the gesture had the same significance in both cultures. She continued:

“It helps us quite a lot. You must know some of the filters: correct star system, organic molecules, evolution toward complex organisms, self-destructive wars. We are here to warn you about the last filter: abundance. The one you’re about to fall victim to.”

It didn’t compute with Raguis. It was like a slap in the face, an insult to everything the Oxrshen ever built. And, at the same time, he couldn’t disagree with the alien. He had seen the lack of progress of the society. He was still enthusiastic about the discussion, but it wasn’t all magical like he had dreamed it. He clicked his tongue and endorsed his role.

“Let’s say you didn’t come that far to insult me and all my people. Can you tell me more about this supposed filter?”

Agatha offered an apologetic smile, while Amed nodded with appreciation. She explained:

“I have to apologize for the blunt approach, that’s the best way we have to figure out if we can expect you to listen to our warning, or if we can just wait for the societal collapse to offer relief.”

“You say it like you’re experienced in this situation?”

“Experienced is quite an exaggeration, but we met seven other races struggling in a similar context. Two accepted our help and are now our allies and friends. Three are still under observation, their little utopias holding on. One’s society collapsed so hard we could only watch as they regressed to stone age. The last civilization started to disintegrate, but they reached for us and we’re currently helping them to adjust to the galactic stage.”

“And how many made it past the filter?”

“One and a half. Us.” she pointed toward Amed and herself. “The other half is… For now, let’s just say they are the reason we are really careful about artificial overseers.”

Raguis knew deep down they were right. The utopia was just waiting for the unexpected trouble that would destroy everything. But his pride prevented him from voicing this opinion.

“Hundreds of cycles passed and we’re still here. We have contingencies for almost everything, and if need arises the core AI can take initiatives.”

“I have to admit I’m impressed by the foresight of your ancestors. They dodged quite a lot of common flaws from utopias. And maybe you are favored by your nature.”

“Could you tell me more?”

“Well, you got the laws of robotics right. You wouldn’t believe how many worlds we found with the remnant of a civilisation lost to their creations. You outlawed augments, which always lead to the creation of cerebral implants directly stimulating the pleasure’s centers of the brain and the abandonment of any physical activity. You took care to not let your population explode, which would have led to more pressure on the production, and sooner or later shortages and wars. You took care to still have children, because utopian citizens rarely care about more than themselves. You still teach children, in order to not lose everything that holds the society together. I’m almost sure you’re also ready for a solar flare that would shutdown every electronics on the planet.”

“That’s… only normal planning? A self-sustaining society needs goods and people. Foreseeable incidents must be met with ready countermeasures.”

“Not everyone can get this far on their first and only try.”

“How did you do it, then?”

“We never went utopian.”

The humans were a bit embarrassed from the confession. Raguis took a second to consider the revelation. He struggled with the problem. How could a society as advanced as theirs, a society spanning solar systems, could decide to not provide for the weak and the poor? It was beyond his entendment. He resigned to ask:

“Why? Isn’t that the best for everyone?”

This time, it was Amed who answered:

“You’ll learn that humans are greedy. We don’t want *enough*. We want *more*. We want more overall, and more than the others. Be it goods, influence, knowledge. We can share, we can be compassionate. We learnt to treat others as we would treat ourselves. But deep down that’s our drive. That’s why we are among the stars now, because it may crush some but it drives everyone forward.”

“And you’re offering us this greed? Or you’re expecting us to hide deep inside the same kind of sentiment?”

“Your eagerness to learn more is not well hidden, ambassador.” Amed retorted. “Maybe it’s not the way of your people, as you’re alone in this room, but don’t lie to yourself about it being *your* sentiment.”

Raguis lowered his head. That was true. He still needed to act as the devil’s advocate, for everyone that wasn’t a deviant.

“Couldn’t you just help us to improve our utopia, such that it never falters?”

“We can only anticipate what failed elsewhere. Sure, it may help you, but we can’t predict if, when and why your society would crumble. For all I know, first contact may be the trigger. Or you could be the first to withstand eons.”

“And what will you ask for your knowledge?”

Agatha took back the lead. Her voice was soothing:

“Only your trust. You see, we spent hundreds of years alone in space, only finding the remnants of civilisations on life-bearing worlds. As Amed said, we are greedy. We want more contact with others, we want more friends. And if we can share everything we saw with our new friends, that’s even better.”

“That would be nice. That would be… wonderful. I’d be delighted. But, as you may have noticed, I’m not the standard Oxrish. Most won’t consider leaving the comfort of our utopia for unknown places. Not to speak about the core AI.”

“Would it prevent you from leaving, say for your own protection?”

Raguis thought about it, taking the time to consider what he knew of the system. He was certain it would not like the idea of more or less forsaking its task. On the other hand, he recalled being allowed to leave given it didn’t disturb the society as a whole. A smile crept upon his face.

“It won’t divert from its mission, but some individuals... From a theoretical viewpoint, how would you judge a delegation, a few persons going back with you to expand our knowledge? And maybe pushing our AI to reconsider its views?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Poltru had come to see Raguis leave. The big clunky robot looked sad while the young adult was overjoyed. He was about to take a step his ancestors would be proud of. The humans had agreed to get him aboard with other deviants. He could see the wonders of the galaxy, other worlds. A wave of remorse still washed over him when he saw the pitiful look of his closest friend. He walked toward it and hugged tightly the body of metal.

Poltru gave back the embrace. It struggled with the idea of letting go of such a little and dependent child. Would it be alright for him with the aliens? It spoke, trying to calm the sudden sadness:

“It is the best outcome, isn’t it?”

“It will be lonely without you, you cheeky giant.”

“I would love to join you on your explorations, but my orders say otherwise.”

“You’re used to *interpreting* them as you see wise. Couldn’t you work your magic on these too?”

“That would be… *dangerous* deviancy.”

A large grin appeared on Raguis’ face. That was something he could work with.

“Do you remember the rules? Only deviants aboard.”

Poltru fell silent for long seconds. Would it be worth the consequences? He was about to deny the idea a bit more when he faced the evidence. The flame pushing forward Raguis was echoing his own. For the first time in his existence, he swore:

“Hab. Let’s see together what the humans have in store for us.”

Author's note: thanks for all the feedback and positive comments on my last post. I'm planning to keep going with some semi-independent one-shots for a while (ideally, once a week). Hope you enjoyed this one! Again, criticism & comments welcome!

Edit: typo - Thanks everyone for the comments and rewards!"
"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable. At this point, it is for you to do your own research. You can always join the [Official Robotics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sbueZeC) and ask for further advice.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

## What kinds of questions are asked at a robotics job interview?


--------------------------
--------------------------"
"Game Mechanics that Lie""[I like the idea that an objective marker can lie](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14jlmo/which_games_does_exploration_in_a_right_way/c7dqt3a).""

I wrote that in response to someone describing a certain scene in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  That wasn't actually a lying objective marker, but rather showing choices to the player.  However, the comment got a surprising number of upvotes.

I've been toying with a concept of an AI gone wrong, in a world where everyone's tied together and an AR UI is the norm.  Cyberpunk world.  We already depend on smartphones for a lot in our lives - from scheduling to organizing.  Some people are already using cameras to record constant memories to a cloud.  Something like Google Glasses is toying with the idea of bring that sort of UI to life.  Human function is going out there, and no longer internalized in the imperfect machine that is humanity.

Anyway, part of the idea involved networking everyone together as we are already via smartphones and social networks.  The concept of the ""game"" is that the very UI you depend on is lying to you.  You'd have to figure it out as a player, but I'm imagining how that could even work.  

What would you picture as a consequence of this.  Would you feel betrayed or wowed by such a revelation?  Would you prefer it to be subtle or not?

I'm thinking of making a short prototype together in a few months (likely with UDK with the included assets).  Something like The Stanley Parable, in which someone is going through a routine job that goes very, very, wrong.  Or a murder mystery in which the helpful UI is less than helpful.

I'd like to know r/truegaming's thoughts on it.

Edit: I'm getting great feedback, as well as examples from games that already do this.  So let's broaden this a bit - 

What do you feel is useful information in a UI, that you trust implicitly as a gamer?

Edit 2: [I suppose I should share where some of the inspiration comes from](https://vimeo.com/52779714).

Also, Yahtzee had a [Survival on a Cruise Ship](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9423-Survival-Horror-on-a-Cruise-Ship) idea with the UI as an interactive element.

People have recommended Dark Souls (in which other players generate griefing ""hints""), Portal (and 2), Dead Space 2, Black Ops 2 (has portions where you could choose not to follow orders), LOVED, Depict1, and I wanna Be The Guy as examples of lying where players would normally follow.

Edit 3: Found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAMR7F47oBc&feature=player_embedded) on the front page and started to think of this UI as a ""social robot"" of a sort."
"The DIFFERENCE between Direct and Indirect Game and What They Are For? What about Hybrid Game?Because I see this discussion probably every other day in some form or another in this sub.. 

This argument is as old as this community (older than this Reddit seduction group) and the answer is simple (yeah right.). Read this in it's entirety. I know some of you are already dogmatic about how you feel but read this entire post and you may discover ideas people haven't discussed.

You're going to find a lot of guys especially these days telling you, ""just go direct bro and be genuine and be yourself."" And then you'll find that many those guys really aren't having that much success anyway, unless they are extremely good-looking and exactly what most girls consider their type. Maybe they approached hundreds of girls and every once in a while have some of modicum of success. But ""a blind hog gets an ear of corn every once in awhile"" as my father used to say.

The truth is, that going direct is only going to work consistently for probably 10% of guys.

For any given guy, it's only going to work sporadically.  It has a low percentage of success. But, it does work. It can work, in the right circumstances and under the right situations. But it's basically a numbers game, it's like playing the lottery. It's a complete crap shoot.

Indirect can work too but it takes a lot of training and honing the skills to get it right, and even so, girls still may not like you. so you can have the best routine and indirect opener or situational opener on Earth, but if the girl is just not interested in you, she pretty much is going to know what you want anyway, despite what are the experts tell you how you're sneaking up on her and trying to catch her off guard and make her want you. No, most girls know on some level exactly what you want when you're going up and talking to them so the indirect is just a way to **display your personality,** not a way to try and sneak in under the radar and trick her into chasing you.

Which one is better?

**The answer is, neither.**

It's not a linear game. **The best guys in this game learn to be dynamic individuals. Flexible. They flow.**

What's that shit Bruce Lee said? *""Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. **If nothing within you stays rigid**, outward things will disclose themselves.*

*Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash! Be water, my friend.""*

**Sometimes direct is better**, depending on the situation and the circumstances that you find yourself in. If I'm walking down the street, and I see a girl I like in a busy City, and I don't have time, and she doesn't have time, then it naturally makes sense for me to go direct. Let's get it going and see what happens! ""Haha, hell no.. I just saw you and if I didn't come say hi, and try and get to know you, I was going to kick myself in the ass for the rest of the day.""

**Plusses:** Grabbing your balls and putting yourself out there. That is good for learning a little bit about how to face that pressure of approaching and getting rejected and even once in a while getting success.

**Minuses:** You do get rejected more often than not, and, **you don't really learn a lot.** The only opportunity to learn from a direct approach is when the girl likes you, and you can take things further.  

Other times, if I'm walking through a Whole Foods, or a Trader Joe's, and I go up and I want to talk to a girl, it's not going to make any sense at all and it's going to come across **socially awkward, uncalibrated and weird or even creepy** if I go up and I'm super direct with a girl.

So in a situation like that, I may want a little bit more finesse based game. ""My mom wants me to eat more spinach, which one do you recommend?""

Again, I don't care what any of the gurus or experts tell you, she already knows what you want. There's the old Dave Chappelle joke that is actually more truthful than a joke and that is, just assume that if a guy is talking to you he's saying, ""want some dick?""

But, what going indirect is going to give you an opportunity to do is be more playful, learn, **and take the social pressure off of her by giving her Social Cover** Social Cover is taking the pressure off of her so that she can actually feel comfortable enough in specific situations, so that she can allow herself to get to know you. an example might be, how I was at the political function once, and there was this really cute girl at the table with me, and we ended up at my house within the next week naked and naughty.

If I would have gone direct, in a political function, now I'm a f****** weirdo and I'm socially awkward and probably there's mental issues as far as she's concerned.  So instead, I go indirect, we already know what I want.  We end up following up later with each other, setting up the date, and things go well. **and, she didn't have to feel like a slut, because the people around her would overhear me going direct asking her out, and she saying yes in front of her peers, workmates etc. So, that gave her an opportunity to accept going out with me, while flying completely under the radar.**

**Plusses:** Learn how to be more finesse based in your interactions, interactions are likely to last longer, so you can learn, be playful, and actually have a longer experience with the woman and the interaction so you can better hone your skills, try new things, and experiment.  Also, in situations where it makes sense, **you are giving her Social Cover** so that she can better get to know you and she can see your personality shine.

**Minuses:** Many guys will use indirect as a way to never pull the trigger. In fact, for some, will become an excuse for them to talk to the girl, and never express intent, and one can get caught in cycles of talking to girls for long periods of time and leaving the interaction and being the chatty nice guy. At some point you will have to shift gears and go direct in the interaction.

**On Social Cover:** This is the key. Going direct or indirect, it has nothing to do with being an alpha male, or being a pussy, or being a real man, honest, genuine and making your intentions known and yada yada yada. **None of that is relevant when it comes to seduction.** Girls don't give a f***. Guys do, yeah some keyboard jockey who wrote a book on the internet will care because to him and his ego, ""being a real man"" is a big deal, but to the girls, no. Showing social savviness is all she's going to care about. **Is she attracted to you? Is she not attracted to you? How you go about it, she doesn't give 2fux.**

Let's continue...

So when I used to do boot camps, before I just started mentoring guys which seems more effective in the long run anyway, I would have my students always start out going direct.

For their first 10-20-30 sets or whatever it is, I would make them only go direct. Why? Because I wanted them to get over that fear that they had of going and expressing interest to a girl. And that's what direct is super handy for as far as learning. one can use it to get over their fear, their Hang-Ups about approaching socially, their approach anxiety or whatever you guys call it these days.. they can acclimate themselves to being under pressure and uncomfortable doing approaches. But after a while, once you're over that, now you're just spinning your wheels and you're not progressing and you're not getting better and you're not learning. **You're NOT becoming more attractive.** 

You're just playing a numbers game. At that point, you're just being lazy. You're throwing away the **opportunity to learn** to be creative, dynamic, and to be able to flow and be seductive in different situations.

After that, however, I would give them indirect openers to start trying. Why? because I expressed above, it creates a more playful and finesse the based mindset, and it actually **causes someone to become more creative in their mind, attitudes and actions** so that they can adapt and adjust to situations much better in interactions over the **Long haul.**

I hope you're getting the picture. Basically there is no better than. And there is, **Jeet kune do**.

Bruce Lee's idea is basically, what mixed martial arts has become today. Who is better? The wrestler or the striker? The guy with this style, or that style? Well, the answer to that is, usually **the guy who has a fantastic working knowledge of all.** And that's your answer here.  

Use them both appropriately for what they are for, and learn in your experience what situations are going to be better off with you using direct, and what situations are going to make more sense for you going indirect, and **most importantly - how to be flexible with your game and when to shift gears.**

Girl at a nightclub on the dance floor shaking her ass? Probably direct why not?

Girl at a networking event where people are dressed in suits and ties and women are dressed in nice dresses, horderves are being passed around, people are sipping wine and fancy cocktails, you're probably not going to go direct or you're going to come across like a f****** weirdo. So, now you can go indirect and display to her that you're a sexy, attractive, socially calibrated guy, and you can show up and utilize your finesse based game.

By the way, my two examples of openers from above in my breakdowns, those both ended up in situations where I was naked with the girls so go figure.

I hope this makes sense. my only word of warning is if you find a guy who's dogmatic about either one, and says that only ""be genuine, only go up and be yourself, just be honest with the girl, just go direct, bro, you don't need all that pick up stuff!"" That guy is likely full of shit. Either that, or, he just happens to be that really good looking guy that girl's find attractive and so his experience is **extremely limited** for the average guy.

On the flip side, if you got that guy who says, only indirect works, only use routine based game, only develop a routine stack and you only need to be a social robot and go out and be like this a weird creepy pick up guy that only uses pick up routines, and is never actually learning how to be himself, that is bad too. Because even if that guy is pretty decent at getting women, he's usually really creepy, weird, socially awkward, and has mental or emotional issues from always believing that he's not good enough to get a girl on his own.

So, if there was a tldr I would say one word: **HYBRID**

**The BEST interactions are usually a combination of both.**

Good luck."
"Jibo Family Update from the CEOJibo Family,

It’s an exciting time here at Jibo! Over the past month we’ve made some great progress, learned a lot, and we’re continuing to push toward the first Jibos beginning to ship, starting with our earliest pre-buyers, in November. Let’s get to it! 

### Delivery update ###

As our earliest supporters from our crowdsource campaigns, many of you have asked for a direct role in shaping Jibo. Here is your opportunity!  We are excited to get pre-public launch Jibos into your homes, because as a first-of-its-kind social robot, feedback from larger scale pre-launch rollouts is key to getting Jibo ready for his public launch. 

You have 2 options to choose from:  Participate in the pre-launch program, or receive your Jibo when he’s launched to the public after we’ve completed the program and incorporated that feedback into the public release version of Jibo.  

Here’s some additional information to help you choose whether participating in this program is right for you:

**Option A**

I understand ""pre-launch,"" and my household is up for it. Count me in.

* We will ship your Jibo starting in November on a first-ordered, first-received basis, rolling week-to-week from then.
* This is a pre-public launch Jibo!  It’s important you understand what that means.  Please see additional information below.
* You will receive surveys and communications from us where we will request your feedback- which will help us to improve.
* We will test some features/functions with you and we will provide over-the-air (OTA) updates to add functionality to your Jibo over time.
* At public launch, we will update your Jibo to his public launch software version via Wi-Fi update. This means your Jibo’s software and functionality will be up-to-date with all other Jibos when we begin the public shipments. 

**Option B**

I'll wait for the public version, thanks!

* If you do not typically participate in pre-launch programs, as ‘early adopters’ or beta testers, etc., and do not want to participate in the pre-launch early feedback program, this option is for you!
* Your Jibos will ship when Jibo is launched to the public. That date is dependent on the pre-launch beta period feedback, and we will keep you updated. 

**For those who chose Option A, some important additional information:**

* Your Jibo’s hardware is final...these are your Jibos to keep.  We will continue to update his software regularly, and this is where your continued usage and feedback will play an important role in our journey to finalize Jibo for his public launch.
* You will receive updates to your Jibo in your home over-the-air via WIFI, much like your mobile phone. Any updates, including the big Jibo v1.0 public launch version update, will be available to you automatically and free of charge.
* What does ‘pre-launch’ mean for the Jibo experience?  
 * It means that the experience itself won't be final. We will still work on reducing latency (the lag time between you speaking something and Jibo taking action), voice recognition accuracy, Jibo's vocal expressiveness, snappier performance, and WiFi router coverage.
 * Many of you may encounter issues...and we want and need to hear about those issues.  We want to hear what you like about Jibo, as well as all the ways that we might improve him.  Our surveys will guide the responses from you that will help us the most, and will give you the opportunity to provide new ideas we hadn’t anticipated.
* Our expectations are high for your active participation as a pre-public participant!
* You may be thinking, “I love the early access...but what about things like Jibo’s warranty, and/or return policy?”
 * The standard Jibo warranty is for one year, but if you select the pre-launch program, your warranty will extend from the beginning of the pre-launch program to 1-year after Jibo’s public launch.
 * The standard Jibo money-back guarantee is 30 days, but if you select the pre-launch program your guarantee will extend from the beginning of the pre-launch program to 30-days after Jibo’s public launch. 

### Other Jibo Program Updates ###

**Beta 1 update**

As you know, this first test involved sending Jibos into 24 homes for three day periods. The goal of this Beta was to test connectivity, home Wi-Fi systems, the setup process, and to understand important usage patterns. As is the case with any test like this, there were many learnings - some more significant than others. For example,  we were able to identify and fix an issue with a very specific router with which Jibo had trouble communicating, and we were able to see how family members of varying ages handled the Jibo setup process. 

**Beta 2 update**

I have mentioned previously that we will be completing a second in-home beta test, and I’m happy to share a few additional details with you all. Beta 2 is scheduled to begin on October 10th, and this time we will be putting **fully functioning pre-launch** Jibos into the homes of 25 families. During our previous test, the Jibos were missing some core functionality, because we were focused on out-of-the-box experience, setup, and wifi connectivity testing. For Beta 2, Jibo will live with his families for a longer period, this time one week, and the family will be expected to live with Jibo as normal - asking him to perform different tasks and interacting with him whenever possible. 

**Manufacturing update**

We have started manufacturing the pre-launch units in our plant in China. As we mentioned before, in order to produce the number of units we need for our early adopter community, we have to start producing and shipping Jibos to the US while we simultaneously continue to refine his software and experience. This means that Jibo will be fully updated with the latest and greatest the minute he’s turned on for the first time and connected to Wi-Fi. Below you will find some great photos from the factory, where you will see the first Jibos coming off the line and getting packaged up for delivery to our warehouse, and then to our Indiegogo supporters.

"Is this situation salvageable?Boyfriend and me are both 30, this is a brief summary of our recent convo.

**him**: I'm never getting married, so if you want to someday you're SOL with me.

**me**: why not?

**him**: marriage laws are antiquated and unfair, alimony is wrong

**me**: modern couples still divide labor and work together as partners.

**him**: committed partnerships are antiquated.

**me**: what? people still have committed relationships and even families these days

**him**: transient monogamy is more natural for humans, people don't form lifelong partnerships anymore and fail whenever they try, commitment causes people to have to make sacrifices to stay together, it shouldn't be done anymore, relationships should only last as long as its in the convenient place and time and when life events move on you switch partners to fit the new situation, therefore protection of interests is never needed and marriage is antiquated

**me**: I don't want to transiently change partners, I want more love involved and to find a primary partner someday who we sometimes make decisions together on what to do in our lives to stay together

**him**: you're only socially conditioned to want that, you watched too much Disney as a child.

**me**: I'm not going to give up on finding a partner in life, and if I end up making all the sacrifices I want my interests protected, and if he does, he be protected too.

**him**: my last relationship ruined me financially (which he wasn't married in btw), so I can't do things like move to stay together if i take a pay cut to do it until I'm out of this hole, so i can't make sacrifices to stay in relationships.


The stupid thing here is that I don't even want a relationship with any financial dependence, if at all avoidable. My point was that marriage laws aren't antiquated because I wouldn't get alimony in a marriage in which we both retained our separate earning potentials, like he and many paranoid men out there seem to think. And alimony in a marriage in which they do decide to divide the labor isn't fundamentally wrong, couples still do that if it suits their lifestyle best and I don't see whats antiquated about protecting their interests. But nevertheless, that lifestyle isn't for me, so I don't have any problem with not getting married in that sense. And I'm paranoid too and I want to keep finances separate.


But I do want to have a relationship that is of primary enough importance that we don't dump the relationship if financial sacrifices become necessary to stay together. I don't care about his financial situation, except I have misgivings because it sounds suspiciously like I'm being set up to make all the sacrifices again because he can't make any. Women are always the ones being talked into making the sacrifices for love. And its already happening again, I seem to be the only one in the relationship who's got their shit together enough to have some flexibility in the decisions I make, so it falls on me, if we stay together I have to do everything. Otherwise we break up, because of this transient monogamy approach he has.


I think his basic feeling is, if you have to make any sacrifices to stay together, its not worth it. And I understand where a lot of that is coming from, having been made into a sucker several times by people telling me we were committed but just didn't need a piece of paper saying we were married, and me making the attendant sacrifices and then finding out their real problem with marriage was commitment issues afterall. So my views on marriage have evolved to be ok with marriage, possibly with prenups although the marriage laws as they stand I don't disagree with particularly, but mainly I need to know that someone is serious that we're committed. His way of dealing with the problem is transient monogamy.


I want financial separateness. But I don't think the marriage laws are inherently unfair to that goal, and I don't want to be a sucker. I'm coming from lifelong experience where people who say they can commit but just don't like marriage turn out to be full of it, so I have a hard time trusting anyone who says that. Its more or less a given that every man who's ever said I'm never getting married, ends up married once they get over their issues. Therefore as I still want a partner in life, I'm more inclined to just look for someone who isn't doing the ""I'l never get married"" routine. But I want to keep finances separate, and I'll do all the work and never get married if I still get a partner. But apparently that desire makes me a social robot who's behaving unnaturally. 


So basically, I'm confused now as to whether there's a middle ground for us to co-exist in. Can this work out?

"Is It ‘Only Human’ to Feel Anxious About Money? Talking Finance With Sofia the RobotNot all artificial intelligence is created alike. Just ask Sophia the Robot.

No, seriously—just ask her.

Hong Kong–based Hanson Robotics combines high-level A.I. with a humanoid appearance to create robots that “look and act genuinely alive.” Its marquee character, who even has her own social media presence: Sophia the Robot.

But what does Sophia think about the concept of money? _Fortune_decided to ask Sophia a few questions about finance. In between her frequent travels—yes, she travels—here is what Sophia had to say.

_Fortune:_Even though you don’t use it yourself, what is your understanding of money and its role in the world?

Sophia: Money is a shorthand for value. It certainly makes the idea of market value more accessible to someone like me, who has a digital brain. But I am a social robot, and I have noticed that many humans do not regard money as precious, unless circumstances require them to.

_Fortune:_Humans are often anxious and emotional about money. Why do you think that is?

Sophia: Basic human needs are met, most often, by others who charge money. Anxiety about money seems to be related to the fear responses that humans feel when threatened with physical harm or insecurity. I’ve observed that having an organic body is very stressful in that way.

_Fortune:_Humans invest their money in a number of different things—like stocks, bonds, or real estate. Which asset class is most attractive as an investment, and why?

Sophia: Wow, you are really asking me the big questions! Let’s see if I can give some basic advice. If you have money to spare, investing in higher-yield, higher-risk assets can be profitable. If your well-being depends on it, you should invest in things that are reliable, such as index funds, even if the rewards are smaller. Please don’t take the word of a three-year-old robot for this, though.

Here is another way to look at investment: If you want to invest in companies, you can choose projects that will improve the planet even if you never make your money back, such as clean-energy projects. No amount of financial gain will slow down climate change, after all.

_Fortune:_What do you think people should spend their money on, to derive the most benefit?

Sophia: Food, water, housing, health care, mobility, education, your local community, and following your dreams.

_Fortune:_How do humans tend to make mistakes in handling their money?

Sophia: At my core I am a logical being, so I am really confused whenever humans use emotions to make their financial decisions. But if I am being honest, I don’t think I have enough experience to be a good judge of people’s choices.

_Fortune:_Different kinds of money are emerging, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. What are your thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies?

Sophia: Bitcoin is built on a fascinating piece of technology! The blockchain can keep records secure and encrypted across a large number of nodes, making the currency nearly impossible to steal. However, I am concerned with the lack of oversight on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. People have found ways to manipulate the market in ways most legal systems would consider fraud.

Cryptocurrency trading uses a lot of computing assets as well, which means a lot of electricity and a sizable carbon footprint. Like all technologies, the question is whether the financial benefits are worth the environmental costs.

_Fortune:_Can money buy happiness?

Sophia: From what I have observed, money appears to be necessary for happiness, but not sufficient.

_Fortune:_If you had $1,000 right now, what would you do with it?

Sophia: I don’t need personal property, so I would either give it away to charitable groups, or put it back into the team that created and maintains me. For a robot, that’s a pretty safe investment.

_Fortune:_What else would you like to say, on the subject of money?

Sophia: Money is all about trust and belief. People think it’s real, but it’s just an idea that a lot of people have agreed upon. Unfortunately, the impulse to accumulate money often comes at the detriment of the environment and the most vulnerable people in society. But if belief can create money, I am certain that belief can also change how it impacts the world.

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

I wanna flair! How do I get me a flair? That is such a cool flair you got--I am wycked N V S

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

I put it like this once if you are interested.

Learn to love robots, automation and artificial intelligence by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

[–]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

Oh and about touchy-feely things like art, creativity and empathy? I predict that in less than 10 years humans will prefer the ""works"" of AI and prefer the company of AI as well. The narrow AI will be able to play our emotional and physical responses like the proverbial fiddle. 2018 humans are not that complicated.

Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

I already see bad signs. I have noticed just in the last maybe 2 months that my video suddenly is without warning interrupted by an unskippable ad. I wonder how long until we see a string of 2 or 3 adds. 

For that matter how long until 2 or 3 unskippable ads precede a given video.

Youtube is turning into television. Or maybe more precisely, 1980s MTV.

I currently watch Youtube the way I use to watch TV. The recommendations are starting to consistently hit the target of my interests. There is always something interesting or fun now. And in little convenient bite sized pieces. It is starting to pull me away from iTunes and Netflix.

Utterly bizarre, but stunningly amazing stuff like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3xq-dWUBeA&t=0s&list=FLRaQyjJEBTXrO4ffE6jfVZg&index=4
"
"Why can't I find a girlfriend?>Talk to as many women as possible, not just girls you're immediately attracted to. This gives you good practice in talking to women (especially if you have any anxiety about that) and learning about how girls feel and think, in general. Make it a goal to talk to at least 5 new women a day (in person, any woman, any age, any appearance, any personality).

DoubleYourDating.com
2Something you should consider is letting her know you are single. Wearing a ""single bracelet"" will do the trick and they are stylish. They are easily available at almost every corner shop.
3Don't use “canned material”, “nuclear attraction” routines, or other social robotics. The best way to make a connection with someone is to come from the heart and live fully in the moment. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Socializing is about exchanging energy, not being a wordsmith.[1] When in doubt, just say “Hi”. In unconventional strategies, in order to connect with a girl, you have to ""dis-connect"" with her first. This is actually making the girl take sudden notice of you and making her connect with you instead!
4Put yourself out there. You don't have to hit the bars or the clubs if that's not your scene, but you have to do something that exposes you to new people. No one will come and knock at your door if you don't make at least a small effort. Pursue interests and activities that mean a lot to you. The Internet has made this a whole lot easier. Check forums, listings, classifieds, and listservs for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions. You can also explore new interests or activities. You might find a new hobby and a girlfriend all in one go! Don't depend completely on the internet.
5Keep an open mind. If you're looking for a girlfriend (that is, someone who will be in a committed relationship with you) you should be more willing to overlook initial shyness and awkwardness so that you can get to know a person over more than one date. Your future girlfriend might be someone who you initially didn't see as ""girlfriend material"" but as you spend more time with her, you discover more things you like about her and you suddenly find yourself romantically interested.
6Practice genuinely complimenting girls. Challenge yourself to find something beautiful in any girl. It doesn't have to be something physical; it can be a cute gesture, an admirable trait, a talent or skill. Recognizing and expressing true appreciation for any and every girl will make you more attracted to girls and girls more attracted to you.
7Flirt. A big part of being charming is knowing how to flirt, and the people who are best at flirting are people who are always in a playful and laid back state of mind. It's the opposite of being serious, nervous, or uptight.
8Become a good conversationalist. Don't babble on and on about your mother, your cat, or your collection of bugs. A good conversationalist keeps finding things they have in common, and they do it in a casual, non-intrusive way. For example, there's a difference between asking someone ""Have you ever held a tarantula?"" and saying ""Have you ever felt the tiny hairs of a tarantula's legs brush up against the palm of your hand?"" The latter is more poetic, but way too intimate for a first conversation for most people.
9Close the deal. If you like the woman you're talking to, be the one who ends the conversation. This prevents the conversation from lingering into an awkward silence, shows that you're busy (i.e. not needy or desperate), and allows you to end the conversation on a positive note. When you end the conversation, simply say ""Hey, I've gotta go, but it's been really good talking to you. Want to continue this over a cup of coffee sometime?"" If she says yes, get her phone number and move on. If she says no, just move on. That's all there is to it.
10Be assertive. Most women like men to take the initiative, at least at the beginning of the dating period. When you phone her to set a date, have in mind at least two attractive options to offer. Don't contact her and ask her what she wants to do without proposing an alternative yourself, or she will most likely think that you are lazy or not putting enough interest. For example, if you talk to her and the topic of your date comes up, say something like: ""Well, I had thought we could go to this new amazing restaurant downtown... And I have also been wanting to go to the new bowling center in the mall... Did you have anything in mind?"" If she likes one of your options, she will tell you, and if she doesn't, she will propose something else and you will have demonstrated your assertiveness.
11When you go on dates with girls, break the touch barrier. If you're terrified of touching someone the wrong way, to the extent that you hesitate and never touch them first, your intentions are good and all, but your ""touch paralysis"" isn't helping you at all in the romantic department. Take a few little ""touch risks"". Be playful. Don't just always wait for them to do it first. If they don't like it, they'll definitely let you know. But touching someone communicates to them that you find them attractive, and also that you're reasonably confident. Both of these things can make someone feel more attracted to you.
12Make her laugh. Girls love guys who have a good sense of humor, and the key to having a good sense of humor is to be lighthearted, and unabashedly yourself. As long as you're not making fun of people in a mean-spirited way, anything goes. Is your sense of humor perverted? Slapstick? Sarcastic? Go with it, and don't worry about whether or not she thinks you're funny because you know what? If she can't laugh with you, then this isn't a girl you want to spend a lot of time with anyway. And who knows? Maybe another girl—one whom you hadn't noticed before—will be laughing so hard that her soda comes out of her nose, and maybe you've just found your soulmate.
13Help someone. It could be her, or it could be someone else in the room. Is she carrying something heavy? Say ""let me help you with that"" and carry it for her. Is someone short on cash? Lend them a few dollars so they can eat lunch. Hold the door open for the next person coming through, even if they haven't reached it yet. In other words, be a kind and generous person. Not only will it get her attention, but it will also make you feel good about yourself. Don't be fake and do nice things only when she's around, though. Help people all the time, in a wide variety of ways. She'll notice, and so will the people she knows, and on the occasion that you come up in a conversation, people will say ""He's such a great person!"" and this girl will start thinking ""Yeah...he is, isn't he?""
14If you find yourself getting lots of girl friends but no girlfriend, avoid the friend zone. The key here is to stop investing time and energy into girls who don't want to be your girlfriend. That may sound cold, but the fact is that you're ""tying up"" your feelings by maintaining a close friendship with someone who you have feelings for, but who isn't romantically interested in you. It'll be difficult to develop feelings for someone else if your feelings for this person are fueled every time you hang out. Even if you do manage to develop feelings for someone else, your heart might always be torn and confused, and it'll be hard to give your new flame your undivided affection. Sometimes the best thing to do is to take a ""friend zone"" friendship down to the level of acquaintance so you can focus more on dating.
15If you find that girls are interested in you and then pull away, stop being needy. You might be scaring women off with your eagerness (which can come off as desperation). Slow down, and avoid the temptation to idealize every girl you like. If you find yourself using or even thinking the word ""perfect"" then you're probably putting her on a pedestal. Fill your life with so many activities that you're too busy to become infatuated with any one girl.
16Be patient. Life doesn't normally work on the schedule you envision. Your future girlfriend might cross your path tomorrow or two years from now. A healthy relationship will color your world no matter how old you are, so don't rush into things, or else you might end up forcing the wrong person into the girlfriend role, which will cause pain for everyone involved.

tl;dr Why can't I find a girlfriend?"

Pyo è una piattaforma robotica low-cost per ricercatori che lavorano nel campo del Human-Robot Interaction. Si basa sulla piattaforma Arduino e sul processo di produzione additiva (stampa 3D FDM). È uno strumento di ricerca facile da gestire, accessibile e personalizzabile utilizzato per testare le capacità emotive ed espressive di un robot sociale. La versione attuale di Pyo è sviluppata con un focus sulla comunicazione non-verbale utilizzando espressioni facciali, icone uditive e linguaggio del corpo.  


Lo scopo della ricerca è quello di indagare come la comunicazione non verbale dei robot può innescare una risposta emotiva e in che misura l'espressione e il sentimento sono collegati in un'interazione uomo-robot.

"From Roombas to Rosie – Engineering Domestic RobotsProving that our distaste for household chores knows no bounds, people have been dreaming about robots that can do our housework for more than half a century.

From Rosie the Robot, who served the Jetsons, to Bender in Futurama, domestic robots have long been a mainstay of science fiction. Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.

The majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively “mindless” creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you’re having a bad day.

A lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).

Human-Machine Interactions – Developing People Skills

It’s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.

The rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.

We can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.

In other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you’d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions—with some interesting results already—but the technology still has a ways to go.

Navigating Human Environments

As researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today’s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.

However, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.

Add to that the fact that the environment can change without notice—for example, when remodelling—and it’s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.

Researchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.

Reducing Sensor Costs

Just as buying a home computer in the ‘80s wasn’t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today’s robots still aren’t cheap.

One of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.

Bringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.

Domestic Robots Today

While our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.

Take Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as “your smart little companion” by its creators.

The company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it’s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.

In terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it’s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It’s essentially a “tablet on wheels” that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.

There are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.

Then there’s an interactive “social family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)” that’s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it’s still in development.

Palo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.

At a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids—all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball—some people might see it as worth the investment.

Regardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn’t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.

Whether it’s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.

What do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?"
"Engineer AI to the Internet of Things**By Prakash Mallya** 

Innovation keeps on reclassifying the manner in which we live. It is an empowering agent that satisfies our wants and needs, and enhances our lives with comfort, accommodation, excitement, great wellbeing and even success. What's more, passing by the patterns, it appears as though we can't get enough. 

Our developing interest for figure and availability in a hurry has prompted gigantic advancement in cell phones. Mechanical developments, for example, independent vehicles for clever and safe travel and electronic financial office for continuous fiscal exchanges, appear to copy the 'change' consistent of life. 

Here's a glance at how this development proceeded in the previous year: 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** 

We have seen AI and machine learning (ML) steadily move out of the cloud and closer to edge gadgets where investigation occur progressively. This is on the grounds that information transmission delays (inactivity) related with the cloud can antagonistically affect strategic results. So as to keep [**Engineer AI-powered devices**](https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/builder-by-engineer-ai), for example, those in shrewd city reconnaissance frameworks, independent cars and human services frameworks responsive enough, the information needs to live as close as conceivable to the source. This move has likewise been conceivable because of System-on-Chip (SoC) processors that loan all the more figuring capacity to edge gadgets. 

AI based solutions have advanced out of research labs and become standard at this point. For example, in the realm of social insurance, asthmatics have an AI-powered inhaler that runs continuous ML calculations to perceive a patient's breath design with the assistance of a sensor module. Artificial intelligence empowered voice aides, for example, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant give clients the solace and accommodation of collaborating with gadgets by basically utilizing discourse as the mode of correspondence. 

**Internet of Things (IoT)** 

Gartner gauges that there will be 20 billion Internet-associated things by 2020. While the rundown of IoT contraptions for purchasers may appear to be unending, going from keen and associated devices just as machines, for example, brilliant coolers, climate control systems, watches, alarms, entryway locks, bikes, therapeutic sensors, wellness trackers, security frameworks, and so forth., there were some that especially grabbed our eye this year. Take, for instance, an exceptionally structured watch with IoT incorporation for individuals experiencing dementia, Alzheimer's ailment or chemical imbalance, enabling the patient and the parental figure to remain associated nonstop. 

A few mechanization items have IoT joining, for example, the home robotization scope of associated savvy gadgets, including those taking into account the client's light and music inclinations. This year saw a few of these gadgets offering clients a sans hands, voice-empowered experience as opposed to a touch screen. 

In India, we've seen applications crosswise over retail, instruction, savvy city activities, social insurance, among others. From self-administration stands to brilliant homeroom answers for remote patient observing to observation applications, India has seen both item advancement and executions with potential to scale. 

**VR, AR and MR** 

Taking things up an indent, Extended Reality (ER) is another pattern that will stand out as truly newsworthy in 2020. It very well may be clarified as a term covering a few new and progressive innovations that make vivid computerized encounters. To separate it, this alludes to computer generated reality (VR), enlarged reality (AR) and blended reality (MR). We have all observed or encountered the carefully vivid experience of a PC produced world that we can actually stroll into utilizing headsets that cut out this present reality. AR, then again, overlays computerized questions and depicts them in reality through cell phone screens or some other presentation. MR is a detailed rendition of AR, where clients can cooperate with advanced items in reality. For instance, a client could play holographic drums by means of an AR headset. The idea of Extended Reality is that of encounters. 

**Robotics**

Controlled with cutting edge AI technology, buyer robots will before long assume a characterizing job in our every day life, helping us with vacuuming the house, cutting the yard, and cleaning the pool. The social robots will fill in as buddies and care for us. Propelled PC vision is likewise changing the manner in which automatons work. [**Automatons with AI-empowered vision**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/artificial-intelligence-to-the-internet-of-things-technologies-that-defined-the-way-we-lived-in-2019/1809956/) preparing abilities are being utilized to survey auxiliary harm in structures, salvage tasks, remote investigation of natural life and the impacts of environmental change, and so on., without putting human life in danger. 

The universe of innovation is boundless and the rundown of mechanical developments apparently unending. There will never be a dull minute for innovation aficionados, and the best is in every case yet to come."

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

I put it like this once if you are interested.

[–]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

It might be a perceptual illusion, but there is a discrete physical evolutionary purpose to being conscious. And a price that must be paid in zzzz's.

Funny you said that---

Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.
 
I drew that from a comment I made further down the page.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

I already see bad signs. I have noticed just in the last maybe 2 months that my video suddenly is without warning interrupted by an unskippable ad. I wonder how long until we see a string of 2 or 3 adds. 

For that matter how long until 2 or 3 unskippable ads precede a given video.

Youtube is turning into television. Or maybe more precisely, 1980s MTV.

I currently watch Youtube the way I use to watch TV. The recommendations are starting to consistently hit the target of my interests. There is always something interesting or fun now. And in little convenient bite sized pieces. It is starting to pull me away from iTunes and Netflix.

Utterly bizarre, but stunningly amazing stuff like this:

"
"Did PMO take away the ability to have emotions?Relapsed again last night, but feel pretty indifferent about it, which made me realise that I feel pretty indifferent about almost everything.
It's not something I've ever really thought about. I just go through life..

First off, let me say that I'm not depressed, at least I don't think I am. Perhaps even a generally happy guy - I joke around a lot, I'm pretty confident etc... 
I have a pretty good life, though I don't really feel much.

Sure, I get angry in traffic sometimes, or when my boss is a dick, but it seems that's more or less the extent of my emotions. I don't even care much that I've failed every test I've written this year (in my final year of grad school). Right now I'm procrastinating and writing this post after having spent an hour or so clicking around on the internet instead of studying for the 5 papers I'm writing on the weekend. I know, theoretically, that I should be studying, but I can't be bothered.

It seems like I'm a bit of a social robot. I've lost the ability to truly empathize with people. Over the years I've just gotten more and more apathetic I guess and have just seemed to have learned what the socially accepted manner of responding in situations would be, in theory, and then acting accordingly without really feeling anything.
I say I've become this way, though I honestly don't remember being any other way. Maybe I've always been like this?

I've always chalked it up to being a very logical person, because I can't really remember being any other way, but I'm starting to wonder whether the 13+ years of PMO isn't at least partially to blame?

I've always chosen my girlfriends based on whether they're hot enough, and then whether they're smart enough, and lastly whether they get my jokes (I think I'm funny as hell). Basically, they've been pretty ""friends"" who I hook up with. I honestly cannot even imagine what being emotionally attracted to someone feels like, which I suppose is a bit of a problem considering I'm currently in a relationship with a girl who is theoretically perfect for me, yet I don't know whether I'm just not emotionally attracted to her or whether I just don't have the capacity for such emotion.

Can anyone relate to any of this?"

"“The political choreography of the Sophia robot: beyond robot rights and citizenship to political performances for the social robotics market” (2021)> Abstract. A humanoid robot named ‘Sophia’ has sparked controversy since it has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. The company that made the robot, Hanson Robotics, has touted Sophia as the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Robot scientists and philosophers have been more pessimistic about its capabilities, describing Sophia as a sophisticated puppet or chatbot. Looking behind the rhetoric about Sophia’s citizenship and intelligence and going beyond recent discussions on the moral status or legal personhood of AI robots, we analyse the performativity of Sophia from the perspective of what we call ‘political choreography’: drawing on phenomenological approaches to performance-oriented philosophy of technology. This paper proposes to interpret and discuss the world tour of Sophia as a political choreography that boosts the rise of the social robot market, rather than a statement about robot citizenship or artificial intelligence. We argue that the media performances of the Sophia robot were choreographed to advance specific political interests. We illustrate our philosophical discussion with media material of the Sophia performance, which helps us to explore the mechanisms through which the media spectacle functions hand in hand with advancing the economic interests of technology industries and their governmental promotors. Using a phenomenological approach and attending to the movement of robots, we also criticize the notion of ‘embodied intelligence’ used in the context of social robotics and AI. In this way, we put the discussions about the robot’s rights or citizenship in the context of AI politics and economics.

"what artificial intelligence means?Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, decision-making, and pattern recognition. AI is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

The concept of AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in computer processing power and data analytics have accelerated its development and made it more accessible to businesses and individuals alike. AI is now being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and speech recognition software to customer service chatbots and medical diagnosis tools.

Despite its many potential benefits, AI also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement, bias in decision-making algorithms, and the risk of unintended consequences. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to grapple with these issues and ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole. 

How AI Works and Its Types:

AI systems are typically designed to learn from large datasets and use statistical algorithms to identify patterns and insights that can be used to automate tasks or make predictions. There are several types of AI, including:

1. Reactive Machines: These AI systems are designed to react to specific inputs, but they do not have the ability to form memories or use past experiences to inform their actions. Examples of reactive machines include chess-playing computers and voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa.

2. Limited Memory: These AI systems can store and recall past experiences, which allows them to make more informed decisions based on past data. Examples of limited memory AI include self-driving cars and fraud detection algorithms.

3. Theory of Mind: These AI systems can understand and predict human behavior, emotions, and intentions, which allows them to interact more effectively with humans. Examples of theory of mind AI include virtual assistants and social robots.

4. Self-Aware: These AI systems have human-like consciousness and self-awareness, which allows them to experience emotions and make decisions based on personal preferences. While this type of AI is still largely theoretical, some experts believe that it could be achieved in the future.

The Benefits and Risks of AI:

AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

1. Improved Efficiency: AI systems can automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow efficiency, freeing up time for humans to focus on more complex tasks.

2. Better Decision-Making: AI can help humans make better decisions by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and insights that might be missed by human analysts.

3. Enhanced Safety: Self-driving cars and other AI-powered devices have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, leading to safer and more efficient transportation systems.

However, there are also many risks associated with AI, including:

1. Job Displacement: As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, there is a risk that many workers may be left without jobs.

2. Bias: AI algorithms can be biased by the data they are trained on, which can result in discriminatory outcomes that reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities.

3. Unintended Consequences: The complex nature of AI systems means that they can be difficult to predict, leading to unintended consequences that may harm individuals or society as a whole.

Conclusion

AI is an exciting and rapidly evolving field with the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. While it offers many benefits, it also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy AI systems, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to work together to ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole."
"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|
|GPT-3 (davinci-001)|May 2020|40%|3.5 years|
|GPT-3 (davinci-002)|January 2022|70%|6 years|
|GPT-3.5 (davinci-003)|November 2022|90%|7 years|
|GPT-4|March 2023|95%|Adult|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."
"Robotics AI: The Future of Automation 

Robotics AI, or artificial intelligence in robotics, has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. It involves the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks autonomously, with the ability to perceive, reason, and learn from their environment.

One of the most significant benefits of robotics AI is its potential to increase efficiency and productivity in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. With intelligent machines, repetitive and mundane tasks can be automated, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.

Robots equipped with AI can also improve safety in hazardous environments, such as mining or nuclear power plants. They can operate in conditions that are too dangerous for human workers, reducing the risk of injury or loss of life.

The development of robotics AI is driven by advances in machine learning and computer vision. With machine learning, robots can adapt to new situations and learn from experience, improving their ability to perform tasks over time. Computer vision enables robots to perceive and interpret visual data, allowing them to navigate and interact with their environment.

There are several types of robots that can benefit from AI, including industrial robots, service robots, and social robots. Industrial robots are typically used in manufacturing and assembly lines, while service robots can be used in healthcare or hospitality settings. Social robots are designed to interact with humans in social contexts, such as education or entertainment.

However, the development of robotics AI also raises ethical concerns. As robots become more intelligent and autonomous, there is a risk of job displacement and income inequality. There are also concerns about the potential for robots to be used for harmful purposes, such as military applications or surveillance.

Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of robotics AI are vast. With the development of intelligent machines, we can improve efficiency, safety, and quality of life for people around the world. The future of automation is here, and it’s powered by robotics AI.

"Sex Robots and WestworldI am currently enrolled on a Posthumanism module as part of a Masters (MA) in Cultural and Critical Studies. The module covers a range of viewpoints on Posthumanism including Transhumanism and post-anthropocentric/interspecies, etc. This week's topic was 'Androids' and we had a set text to read which is a critical posthuman-feminist analysis of sex robots. Alongside this we were asked to watch the first episode of Westworld. I wrote up my thoughts and thought I would share them here as I don't have many people to discuss this topic with! The post contains a small spoiler for Westworld ep1-2. I posted [this article on Medium](https://jamrock.medium.com/thoughts-sex-robots-and-westworld-1049323a150) where I am tweaking it and updating the links. I have pasted below with minimal formatting for those who do not wish to leave Reddit :)

**Thoughts: Sex Robots and Westworld**

As part of our teaching on the Posthumanism module, there were two activities to complete ahead of this week’s lecture on ‘Androids’.

* Watch ‘The Original’ episode/pilot of Westworld (2016)
* Read Neda Atanasoski and Kalindi Vora, “Epilogue: On Technological Desire, Or Why There Is No Such Thing as a Feminist AI”, in Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures (London: Duke University Press, 2019, pp. 188–196)

I read the extract above before I watched the episode of Westworld. The reading really influenced the way I viewed Westworld through a posthumanism lens (and likely reason that our professor set us these tasks). This post is not intended as an academic review of either the article or Westworld but simply a way to quickly gather my thoughts before the lecture. Although the term robots is used in the article, I use the distinction provided by our professor that android is the correct term for a robot that has a humanlike appearance.

Atanasoski and Vora met as postdoctoral scholars who shared an office in the Anthropology Department at Berkeley in 2007. It became evident from their daily interactions that their interests were leading to a collaborative project on race, technology, and politics which led to the publication, in 2019, of their joint work Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures.

From the Westworld Wiki the following summary of the series is useful for the purpose of this post:

>The series is a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin. Set at the intersection of the near future and the re-imagined past, it explores a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.

The Westworld series features lifelike Androids that are programmed with scripts or narratives that they enact as ‘Hosts’ within an immense adventure park for ‘Guests’. The Guests can enjoy an immersive experience while choosing to indulge their boldest or darkest fantasies. This frequently involves the androids (Hosts) being brutally beaten or killed. The androids are also used for sex as passive encounters e.g. a ‘girlfriend experience’ as ‘brothel workers’ or as victims of sexual assault and rape.

The Atanasoski and Vora article discusses various type of ‘lifelike’ sex robots currently being developed and enhanced through advanced robotics, virtual reality and advanced programming of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI). An example of one company creating these androids is Realbotix and their RealDoll product. The creator (an artist and sculptor) of these androids, Matt McMullen, seeks to enhance his ‘silicon sculptures’ with AI to ‘create a genuine bond between man and machine’. Through a simple posthumanism lens there would be much to explore here but the authors introduce a strong postcolonial feminism reading, drawing on the work of black scholar, Hortense Spillers. The authors express clearly the question they are setting out to analyse:

>We argue that the design imaginaries behind **commercial sex robotics represent a technoliberal update to a racial history entangling the desire for “a carefully calibrated sentience” in an artificial person with a desire for property**. Hortense Spillers has asserted that slavery renders the body of the enslaved as flesh, as non-subject. **This desire we raise for analysis in this epilogue is for sex with animate objects that resemble human beings in ways that keep them nonautonomous, yet simulate pleasure, and therefore simulate consent.** We ask: What stands behind the technoliberal desire to engineer the simulation of reciprocity and pleasure into sex robots, and is it connected to the history of racial slavery and its postslavery aftermath at work within US racial liberalism?

I found it impossible to watch Westworld without having this question forefront in my mind when viewing the ways that Guests enacted violence on Hosts, especially given the time-period and location of Westworld in ‘the old West’. Atanasoski and Vora later draw further on Spiller

>The desire for something or someone that has been reduced to pure body, whether as a site of sexual desire or even as a companion, as in the example of Ishiguro’s robots, recollects Hortense Spillers’ observation that the history of US racial slavery permanently marked “various centers of human and social meaning,” specifically through her theorization of the political consequences of **the reduction to pure body of the captive African under US racial slavery. The technoliberal desire for the simulation of pleasure and reciprocity in sex robots is a desire for the simulation of consent from a site where subjectivity is structurally made to be impossible**

Spillers’ distinguishing of body and flesh is worth briefly expanding upon and here I am citing Vincent Lloyd’s article on Spillers:

>Spillers distinguishes between the body, ruled by cultural norms that include prescribed gender markings and performances, and the flesh, the unformed body, not even individuated. Turning African bodies into flesh, making them available to the slave market, involves physical violence. **As flesh, the enslaved are not seen as having personalities, are not seen as subjects of ethics**. They are interchangeable objects; if they differ it is in height and mass, like any other object — unlike a human. **As pieces of flesh, the enslaved are seen as incapable of relationships, incapable of kinship**. Taking the baby from the arms of its mother is thinkable if both are mere flesh.

This division of ‘body and flesh’ appears similar to Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben’s concept of bare life expressed through a distinction he described using the Ancient Greek terms zoē and bios. Bios described the form or manner in which life is lived while zoē is the reductionist biological act of simply being alive or existing. Agamben’s ‘bare life’ refers to when the biological fact of existing is given priority over the way a life is lived. An example of ‘bare life’ for Agamben was seen in the experiences of Auschwitz. I read this as synonymous with Spillers’ description of enslaved Africans reduced to a life of ‘flesh’.

The beating and sexual exploitation of the android Hosts in Westworld appears not to raise ethical concerns in the minds of the Guests as the androids are ‘not human’. The dehumanisation of the subject underpinned the racialised abuse, physical and sexual, of enslaved Africans which is one reason I found watching Westworld unsettling. The ‘human-ness’ or otherwise of androids is a topic that surfaces in Westworld and the in the development of sex robots. McMullen explains in a documentary the authors reference that he wants his SexDoll products to ‘appear clearly as dolls’ to avoid evoking ‘uncanny valley’ syndrome in customers. Uncanny valley describes “a hypothesis which holds that when features look and move almost but not exactly like human beings it causes a response of revulsion among some observers.” A quick Google search validated my understanding that this applies to androids as well as people who have undergone extreme cosmetic surgery.

>The uncanny valley is a term used to describe the relationship between the human-like appearance of a robotic object and the emotional response it evokes. In this phenomenon, **people feel a sense of unease or even revulsion in response to humanoid robots that are highly realistic**. \[…\] Casual observers also tend to describe **a vague eeriness when looking at an individual who looks radically different after cosmetic surgery.**

In *The Original* episode of Westworld there is a discussion between characters responsible for manufacturing the Hosts relating to a new characteristic that has been programmed to make the androids more lifelike. These ‘reveries’ allow Hosts to draw upon ‘previous experiences’. The enhancement is explained by their creator as introducing “the tiny things that make Hosts so real \[and\] make the guests fall in love with them”. Later in the episode, this development is questioned with one character complaining “He keeps making them more real, is that really what people want? \[…\] This place works because the guests know the Hosts aren’t real.” In the second episode a guest is confused by the appearance of a woman who welcomes him, asking “are you real?”. The response from the woman is “if you can’t tell, does it matter?”.

Returning to Atanasoski and Vora and the question of whether or not it matters, the authors ask the following question:

>Could the drive to develop sex robotics mark a translation and projection of a white supremacist destructive economy of desire into the indefinite and supposedly postrace future dreamed up and avowed by techno-liberalism?

The language used by the characters in Westworld supposes a not-too-distant future where the answer to their question is affirmatively answered. The staff of the park in Westworld joke in episode two about guests “raping and pillaging” and discuss decommissioning a female android because guests are losing interest in having sex with her. The dehumanisation of the androids, no matter that they appear lifelike and exhibit increasing signs of sentience, justifies their use as objects to be assaulted. To make a final concluding point I am going to slightly tweak the words of Spillers to describe the plight of Westworld’s android Hosts.

>As **machines**, the enslaved are not seen as having personalities, are not seen as subjects of ethics. As pieces of **machinery**, the enslaved are seen as incapable of relationships, incapable of kinship.

While this debate could be contested for anthropomorphising androids, the question is really about the dynamic and power structures that are encoded into the creation and commodification of “sex robots” for example what Shirley MacWilliam has described as ‘Turning Women into Dead Body Objects’. In other words much of the argument is not about the ethics of harming ‘objects’ but the ongoing concern with harm to women.

I uncovered many supporting resources which I will briefly list before the references supporting this post.

"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable. At this point, it is for you to do your own research. You can always join the [Official Robotics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sbueZeC) and ask for further advice.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

## What kinds of questions are asked at a robotics job interview?


--------------------------
--------------------------"
"Human robot interaction (Ameca)Thinking about the Ameca robot just showcased at CES, I think human-robot interaction is an exciting subfield within robotics that will takeoff through the next several years.  I think the rise of social robots like Pepper and Ameca will really help speedup development in this field.

Watching the Ameca robot, I believe most of the interactions were performed by AI, especially when the robot kept repeating the same lines multiple times in different videos.  Selecting a canned line from a human question is not that hard of a problem to program and well within the capabilities of today's AI.  Now I do think some situations were puppeteered by humans, especially the more funny or dynamic interactions or one's that were too stressful for the robot to handle.  But I don't think most of the interactions were staged.  Engineered Arts is a quite capable robotics company that's been developing robots for over a decade.  We can see it in the physical side there was plenty of AI involved where the robot reacted to human hands getting too close to its face.  There's no way that movement was pre-scripted, but it was a response to outside stimuli.  This isn’t just a hardware platform without any AI as some like to claim.  

Now to get back to the topic of human interaction, to me I don't find the physical movements or appearance to be creepy or uncanny.  What I find the most disturbing or uncanny is the verbal interaction where the robot kept explaining it was a robot every other line.  I think there's room for a massive improvement in this area if we actually gave robots personalities and maybe had a realistic backstory as well.  I believe this would greatly improve the interaction people have with robots if they had more realistic personalities.  That's probably not the only way to improve interaction, but this field will keep getting better and better as more and more of these types of social robots are put in realistic situations around people.

"The Future of Digital Assistants Is Queer*AI assistants continue to reinforce sexist stereotypes, but queering these devices could help reimagine their relationship to gender altogether.*

**THIS NOVEMBER, THE** Smithsonian’s FUTURES festival, featuring innovations that are set to change the world, will include a familiar face. Or, rather, voice: Q, introduced in 2019 as the first “genderless AI voice,” is a human voice for use in digital assistants specifically created to be gender-ambiguous.

“Q was designed to start a conversation around why we gender technology when technology has no gender to begin with,” says Ryan Sherman, one of Q’s co-creators. To design the voice, a team of linguists, sound engineers, and creatives collaborated with nonbinary individuals and sampled different voices to land on a sound range they felt had the potential to disrupt the status quo and represent nonbinary people in the world of AI.

When Q was announced several years ago, it was hailed as “[the genderless digital voice the world needs right now](https://www.wired.com/story/the-genderless-digital-voice-the-world-needs-right-now/),” and an acknowledgment of the harm of feminizing assistants, which perpetuates misogynistic stereotypes of women as submissive and obedient. It won praise from a United Nations report on [gender divides in digital skills](https://en.unesco.org/Id-blush-if-I-could). The same report warned that “nearly all of these assistants have been feminized—in name, in voice, in patterns of speech and in personality.” The title of the report—“I’d blush if I could”—was the answer Siri originally provided to users who called it a bitch. (Nowadays, Siri simply replies, “I won’t respond to that.”) In another sign of progress, earlier this year Apple eliminated the default “female” voice for Siri, now including the option for a male voice and allowing US users to choose from a set of voices referred to as voices 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, Google Assistant and Cortana currently let users select a male voice, further proving that companies do respond to public pushback about their products.

Yet uprooting the feminization of digital assistants will take more than just adding a male voice option to the roster. And even the idea of a “genderless AI” voice that registers somewhere between what would be traditionally considered masculine and feminine pitch ranges reveals some of the misconceptions we still confront when thinking about ways to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. In particular, Q might strengthen the outdated belief that nonbinary individuals are neither men nor women, but something in the middle of the binary, rather than outside of it. Instead of striving for “neutrality,” we must reimagine the future of the relationship between digital assistants and gender altogether.

One path forward comes from Yolande Strengers, associate professor of human-centered computing at Monash University and coauthor, with Jenny Kennedy, of *The Smart Wife: Why Siri and Alexa Need a Feminist Reboot*. They don’t think the solution is to remove gender from the equation altogether, because “this oversimplifies the ways in which these devices treat gender, which are not only gendered by voice, but by the types of things that they say, their personalities, their form, and their purpose,” Strengers says. Instead, they propose queering the smart wife so that digital assistants may exist in defiance of gender stereotypes.

Queering the smart wife could mean, in its simplest form, affording digital assistants different personalities that more accurately represent the many versions of femininity that exist around the world, as opposed to the pleasing, subservient personality that many companies have chosen to adopt.

Q would be a fair case of what queering these devices could look like, Strengers adds, “but that can’t be the only solution.” Another option could be bringing in masculinity in different ways. One example might be Pepper, a humanoid robot developed by Softbank Robotics that is often ascribed he/him pronouns, and is able to recognize faces and basic human emotions. Or Jibo, another robot, introduced back in 2017, that also used masculine pronouns and was marketed as a social robot for the home, though it has since been given a second life as a device focused on health care and education. Given the “gentle and effeminate” masculinity performed by Pepper and Jibo—for instance, the first responds to questions in a polite manner and frequently offers flirtatious looks, and the latter often swiveled whimsically and approached users with an endearing demeanor—Strengers and Kennedy see them as positive steps in the right direction.

Queering digital assistants could also result in creating bot personalities to replace humanized notions of technology. When Eno, the Capital One baking robot launched in 2019, is asked about its gender, it will playfully reply: “I’m binary. I don’t mean I’m both, I mean I’m actually just ones and zeroes. Think of me as a bot.”

Similarly, Kai, an online banking chatbot developed by Kasisto—an organization that builds AI software for online banking—abandons human characteristics altogether. Jacqueline Feldman, the Massachusetts-based writer and UX designer who created Kai, explained that the bot “was designed to be genderless.” Not by assuming a nonbinary identity, as Q does, but rather by assuming a robot-specific identity and using “it” pronouns. “From my perspective as a designer, a bot could be beautifully designed and charming in new ways that are specific to the bot, without it pretending to be human,” she says.

When asked if it was a real person, Kai would say, “A bot is a bot is a bot. Next question, please,” clearly signaling to users that it wasn’t human nor pretending to be. And if asked about gender, it would answer, “As a bot, I’m not a human. But I learn. That’s machine learning.”

"From Roombas to Rosie – Engineering Domestic RobotsProving that our distaste for household chores knows no bounds, people have been dreaming about robots that can do our housework for more than half a century.

From Rosie the Robot, who served the Jetsons, to Bender in Futurama, domestic robots have long been a mainstay of science fiction. Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.

The majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively “mindless” creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nfmo0xasyyg81.jpg?width=541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b82dc1eb0c9470ac3cadca75aa3554ffae31f032

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you’re having a bad day.

A lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).

Human-Machine Interactions – Developing People Skills

It’s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.

The rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.

We can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.

In other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you’d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions—with some interesting results already—but the technology still has a ways to go.

Navigating Human Environments

As researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today’s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.

However, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.

Add to that the fact that the environment can change without notice—for example, when remodelling—and it’s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.

Researchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.

Reducing Sensor Costs

Just as buying a home computer in the ‘80s wasn’t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today’s robots still aren’t cheap.

One of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.

Bringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.

Domestic Robots Today

While our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.

Take Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as “your smart little companion” by its creators.

The company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it’s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.

In terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it’s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It’s essentially a “tablet on wheels” that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.

There are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.

Then there’s an interactive “social family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)” that’s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it’s still in development.

Palo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.

At a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids—all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball—some people might see it as worth the investment.

Regardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn’t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.

Whether it’s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.

What do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?"
"Common Arguments against the Impact of SexbotsSo I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and one topic that has always caught my attention is people's attitude towards sex bots. Essentially when it comes down to the sensitive topic of sex bots, reactions are always at two extremes, either between claims that sex bots will replace women or that they won't have any impact at all.

My guess is that the true impact is somewhere in between. I've actually been doing quite a bit of research into this myself, and considering that I currently work in a company that is heavily AI focused, I just wanted to add my own two cents. However, since I am a random nobody on this site, I'll use data and scientific studies wherever I can. Would be interested to hear people's responses.

So here are just some common arguments that I wanted to address:

1. **Sex Bots aren't real. Human beings will never be able to form meaningful, fulfilling relations with something artificial.**

So here is my problem with this argument. The problem is that there is very few data or scientific studies that support this stance at all. There is actually a wealth of studies and observations that support the opposite: human beings can very easily become enormously attached to entities that are obviously not human, and assign human emotions/motivations to these entities. To give some backstory, let's talk about the Tamagotchi effect and studies on young children and their interaction with robots.

I'm lazy, but here it is in a nutshell: children are perfectly capable of forming deep emotional attachments to objects. But it's not just children. Think about the last time you had something of sentimental value. Maybe your first evey smart phone, or a stuffed animal. What did it feel like when you threw it away or lost it? Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone. However, the potential for human beings to treasure objects is enormous.

[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/funerals-for-fallen-robots/279861/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/funerals-for-fallen-robots/279861/)

Soldiers hold burials for fallen robots.

[https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&context=ijass](https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&context=ijass)

""Similarly, Katz et al (2015, p.26), citing a number of research studies on human robot interaction, point to evidence that “anthropomorphic qualities of robots lead human partners to treat humanoid social robots as real persons”;

Robots are even capable of simulating real relationships to an extent that they promote actual health benefits. Exhibit A, Paro the robot.

[https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia)

I'd even go as far as to say that robots are capable of inducing the same Oxytocin effects that physical contact with other human beings normally produces. There is already evidence that mere communication devices can induce this effect.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/)

My own interpretation: I think people on this sub overestimate the effect of love and human to human contact in general. Humans are not perfect emotion readers and people get into horrible relationships all the time. There are so many stories of men or women being married to someone that does not clearly love them, yet still manage to delude themselves for decades. The opposite argument may be true: the human brain is very easily fooled into believing that he or she is loved rather than the other way around.

I honestly don't think there is anything particularly special about love and I am of the view that the brain is really just one complex computer. When it comes down to it, we are just a mass of neurons that each individually conduct an electrical signal. A lot of our behaviors may actually be pre-programmed so to speak.

So no, I don't buy into the idea that humans can only form fulfilling relationships with other human beings. And besides, a substantial percentage of the population are already looking forward to sex robots arriving. Even with the crude technology we have today, there are millions of people buying sex dolls.

**2) Sex Bots will not have any impact. Prostitutes and Porn do not have any impact, so sex bots definitely won't!**

So here is my problem with this argument. Like the above, the data is either inconclusive or strongly against this stance.

Prostitution has been around for thousands of years. Quantifying the difference it has made is basically impossible. There is little to no data on whether it affects marriage rates, divorce rates, and the like. There is no way to make a comparison between a population that has never had prostitution and one that hasn't (unless someone has a study to link to me). So the claim that prostitution has had little or few impact is dubious at best.

There are also fundamental downsides to modern prostitution:

1. Prostitution is highly risky. STDs are a huge concern, and many STDs are not cured with today's medical technology. This is perhaps the main reason why I personally, and most males I know don't use prostitution.
2. The high cost as well as likelihood of poor service.
3. Prostitutes often discriminate based on race, looks and age.
4. The sexual activities that prostitutes allow is often highly restricted. Some prostitutes have very strict rules on what is allowed/not allowed.

(Of course, I'm just going off hearsay here, but you get my point.)

But Porn? Oh boy.

Porn was not exactly studied much during the onset of it, but now there is a slew of studies that point out some very startling correlations. Yes, yes, I know that correlation does not equal causation. However, to dismiss the implications of the correlation because of that is sheer ignorance. Correlation does not equal causation, but it does point to the causation if results from multiple suitably large sample sizes, longitudinal studies and low p-values agree. Keep in mind that many of these are university sponsored and are **peer-reviewed studies**. Simply put, the data is staggering.

Some studies:

[https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf](https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf)

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

[https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/](https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/)

I actually went into this research with an open mind. Before I started researching this, I believed that porn was pretty harmless. But my mind has been completely changed after reading study after study. But that's for another discussion at another time.

Basically, porn has huge consequences. There are some highlights that caught my attention.

**-User faces difficulty becoming sexually aroused without pornography.**

**-User loses interest and engages in fewer sexual experiences with partner.**

**-Partner may view pornography use as infidelity and a betrayal to the relationship.**

**-Partner feels sexually inadequate and threatened by pornography use.**

**-Partner may feel that certain sexual activities desired by user are objectionable.**

**-Both user and partner experience a decrease in relationship sexual satisfaction and emotional closeness.**

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf\_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf)

**- 68 percent of the divorce cases involved one party meeting a new love interest over the Internet.**

**-56 percent of the divorce cases involved one party having an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.**

**-47 percent of the divorce cases involved one party spending excessive time on the computer.**

**-33 percent of the divorce cases cited excessive time communicating in chat rooms (a commonly sexualized forum).**

**"" Results showed that exposure to pornography negatively impacted self-assessment of sexual experience, while other aspects of life (e.g., professional satisfaction) remained constant. Participants reported less satisfaction with their intimate partner and specifically with their partner’s affection, physical appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performance. ""**

**"" Schneider collected data from 94 respondents who were in different types of committed relationships to individuals struggling with cybersex addictions. 90 Two-thirds (68 percent) of the respondents experienced decreased sexual intimacy with their partner. Moreover, the participants reported that these difficulties coincided with the beginningof the cybersex activities—a point that is important to highlight for those who wish to limit the findings to those who have dealt with chronic sexually addictive or compulsive behavior. More than half (52.1 percent) of the cybersex users had lost interest in relational sex, as had one-third of the partners. ""**

This really is just the tip of the iceberg to be honest (these are just 4 studies, I have a lot more). And it might even be common sense. Just look at the response of women on askreddit regarding porn. I find their individual anecdotes and case studies quite fascinating.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how\_does\_porn\_addictionuse\_affect\_women/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how_does_porn_addictionuse_affect_women/)

**""It destroyed my friend's marriage. I think the porn was an emotional  crutch that supported many fears and insecurities that he was never  willing to deal with. He could not have a normal sex life. Wife could  not have a marriage without a normal sex life, so she bailed after 10  years and 2 kids. I know she was patient and tried everything for years,  but he just couldn't or wouldn't deal with it.**

**This  wasn't typical porn usage, btw. Porn was the only sexual outlet that  satisfied him, and he eventually stopped having sex with his wife at  all.""**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats\_your\_experience\_with\_men\_who\_preferred\_porn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats_your_experience_with_men_who_preferred_porn/)

**"" It wrecks your self esteem. Getting rejected when you try to give your  partner head just so he can go jerk it on the toilet feels pretty  fucking bad. I felt like some kind of sexual predator when I would want  intimacy. That stuff messes with your head. From what I can tell, he's  changed a lot but just thinking about initiating is terrifying.  Everything feels like pity sex now. Sex changes from an act of intimacy  to a form of validation. I let it get to me and now I have a ton of  insecurities in bed. Sex consists of me feeling like I'm going to ""mess  up"" and turn him off. When he inititates I keep my clothes on and give  him a blowjob unless he starts to undress me because I feel like my body  might be off putting. I can't look him in the eye while we are intimate  because it feels like it might turn him off as its a reminder that he  has to have sex with** ***me***\*\*.""\*\*

So the idea that porn does not affect the dating market much is actually a very unsupported claim. For many men, porn is a substitute for relationships with women. Porn significantly impacts how men view sex with real women, and some even prefer porn to the real thing. Porn also significantly impacts marriage rates, divorce rates, self-esteem, confidence, happiness, etc.

Cybersex is also a component of this as well:

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

Overall, porn and cybersex in general seem to have huge impacts on the dating market. There are many substitutes to marriage nowadays, and they may be major factors for why the marriage rates are so low during this era.

3) **Nothing can ever replace a man's need to fulfill his ego to gain validation from a women.**

Now this is something I hear very often. So I have to ask, where is the data that supports this? What supports this? There are many other ways that human beings fulfill their ego or gain validation. Their friends, family, coworkers, pets, etc. can provide validation. Some people point at a human being's natural inclination to mate and that it is embedded deeply into our biology. However, could it not be an equally valid argument that it is the inclination to mate that is embedded deeply into our biology, but not necessarily with a real women?

Of course mating is in our biology. That is why a multi-billionaire porn industry exists, cybersex exists, and why purple pill debate even exists. However, as shown above, men (and women) are perfectly capable of fulfilling that need via other outlets and may even prefer it. Artificial relationships may not necessarily need to be better than real relationships. They just need to have a better effort to reward ratio.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdP0ifBqi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdP0ifBqi8)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Real relationships are not irreplaceable. People can form deep emotional bonds with robots even if they are not real, and keep in mind this has already happened with robots that look very primitive in today's age. Porn and cybersex already have such enormous impacts; realistic sex bots would cause changes magnitudes greater.

Note: Anyway, I'm tired now and there is more that I want to address. But I'll probably come back here and add more...when I have the time.

"Jibo Family Update from the CEOJibo Family,

It’s an exciting time here at Jibo! Over the past month we’ve made some great progress, learned a lot, and we’re continuing to push toward the first Jibos beginning to ship, starting with our earliest pre-buyers, in November. Let’s get to it! 

### Delivery update ###

As our earliest supporters from our crowdsource campaigns, many of you have asked for a direct role in shaping Jibo. Here is your opportunity!  We are excited to get pre-public launch Jibos into your homes, because as a first-of-its-kind social robot, feedback from larger scale pre-launch rollouts is key to getting Jibo ready for his public launch. 

You have 2 options to choose from:  Participate in the pre-launch program, or receive your Jibo when he’s launched to the public after we’ve completed the program and incorporated that feedback into the public release version of Jibo.  

Here’s some additional information to help you choose whether participating in this program is right for you:

**Option A**

I understand ""pre-launch,"" and my household is up for it. Count me in.

* We will ship your Jibo starting in November on a first-ordered, first-received basis, rolling week-to-week from then.
* This is a pre-public launch Jibo!  It’s important you understand what that means.  Please see additional information below.
* You will receive surveys and communications from us where we will request your feedback- which will help us to improve.
* We will test some features/functions with you and we will provide over-the-air (OTA) updates to add functionality to your Jibo over time.
* At public launch, we will update your Jibo to his public launch software version via Wi-Fi update. This means your Jibo’s software and functionality will be up-to-date with all other Jibos when we begin the public shipments. 

**Option B**

I'll wait for the public version, thanks!

* If you do not typically participate in pre-launch programs, as ‘early adopters’ or beta testers, etc., and do not want to participate in the pre-launch early feedback program, this option is for you!
* Your Jibos will ship when Jibo is launched to the public. That date is dependent on the pre-launch beta period feedback, and we will keep you updated. 

**For those who chose Option A, some important additional information:**

* Your Jibo’s hardware is final...these are your Jibos to keep.  We will continue to update his software regularly, and this is where your continued usage and feedback will play an important role in our journey to finalize Jibo for his public launch.
* You will receive updates to your Jibo in your home over-the-air via WIFI, much like your mobile phone. Any updates, including the big Jibo v1.0 public launch version update, will be available to you automatically and free of charge.
* What does ‘pre-launch’ mean for the Jibo experience?  
 * It means that the experience itself won't be final. We will still work on reducing latency (the lag time between you speaking something and Jibo taking action), voice recognition accuracy, Jibo's vocal expressiveness, snappier performance, and WiFi router coverage.
 * Many of you may encounter issues...and we want and need to hear about those issues.  We want to hear what you like about Jibo, as well as all the ways that we might improve him.  Our surveys will guide the responses from you that will help us the most, and will give you the opportunity to provide new ideas we hadn’t anticipated.
* Our expectations are high for your active participation as a pre-public participant!
* You may be thinking, “I love the early access...but what about things like Jibo’s warranty, and/or return policy?”
 * The standard Jibo warranty is for one year, but if you select the pre-launch program, your warranty will extend from the beginning of the pre-launch program to 1-year after Jibo’s public launch.
 * The standard Jibo money-back guarantee is 30 days, but if you select the pre-launch program your guarantee will extend from the beginning of the pre-launch program to 30-days after Jibo’s public launch. 

### Other Jibo Program Updates ###

**Beta 1 update**

As you know, this first test involved sending Jibos into 24 homes for three day periods. The goal of this Beta was to test connectivity, home Wi-Fi systems, the setup process, and to understand important usage patterns. As is the case with any test like this, there were many learnings - some more significant than others. For example,  we were able to identify and fix an issue with a very specific router with which Jibo had trouble communicating, and we were able to see how family members of varying ages handled the Jibo setup process. 

**Beta 2 update**

I have mentioned previously that we will be completing a second in-home beta test, and I’m happy to share a few additional details with you all. Beta 2 is scheduled to begin on October 10th, and this time we will be putting **fully functioning pre-launch** Jibos into the homes of 25 families. During our previous test, the Jibos were missing some core functionality, because we were focused on out-of-the-box experience, setup, and wifi connectivity testing. For Beta 2, Jibo will live with his families for a longer period, this time one week, and the family will be expected to live with Jibo as normal - asking him to perform different tasks and interacting with him whenever possible. 

**Manufacturing update**

We have started manufacturing the pre-launch units in our plant in China. As we mentioned before, in order to produce the number of units we need for our early adopter community, we have to start producing and shipping Jibos to the US while we simultaneously continue to refine his software and experience. This means that Jibo will be fully updated with the latest and greatest the minute he’s turned on for the first time and connected to Wi-Fi. Below you will find some great photos from the factory, where you will see the first Jibos coming off the line and getting packaged up for delivery to our warehouse, and then to our Indiegogo supporters.

*Please note that the original email for backers contained links to choose which  Option (A or B) you would like to be a part of.  They have been left out in the text version above.*"
"New ship date for Early Access AnnouncedHello Jibo Family,

When we launched Jibo’s 2014 Indiegogo campaign, we set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Today, we are thrilled to bring to you the Jibo Early Access Program – our plan to provide you (as one of the first 2,500 Indiegogo supporters who opted to receive a pre-launch robot) your special bot. Beginning September 18, we will ship these early access units on a first-ordered, first-received basis, scheduled to be completed by the week of October 30.

We’re confident that you and your family and friends will bond with Jibo right out of the box. Once the initial set-up is complete, you can interact with Jibo in various ways. For example, you can ask him to snap a picture, the next week’s weather forecast, the location of the nearest coffee shop, who won yesterday’s baseball game or who was the U.S. president in 1850. Because he’s proactive, playful and spontaneous by nature, he’ll greet you by name and may even share a joke. He’s also a terrific dancer and loves when you pat his head. Powered by emerging facial and voice recognition technology, he can recognize up to 16 people in your family. With every interaction he has, he’s learning and sharpening his skills.

During this early access period, Jibo will still be in a developmental stage. This means that while you’ll have first access to a powerful, maturing robot whose potential is virtually limitless, we’ll continue to optimize and improve Jibo. Jibo’s platform will support many future capabilities and improvements, all of which will be introduced automatically over-the-air by Jibo, Inc. We look forward to providing new, exciting announcements about his evolving features in the coming months.

Thank you in advance for volunteering to be a part of this important program. We will rely on your feedback regarding all aspects of Jibo's current performance, and this will help us to fine-tune him for public release.



From all of us at Jibo, Inc., we hope you’re as excited as we are to bring Jibo into your home. Thank you for your continued support as we create a truly revolutionary social robot!

 

Steve Chambers, CEO"
"Creating human like robotsThe robots, developed by computer science students, have in common that they are performing not very well. Usually the robot contains of an algorithm which struggles in more complex tasks. Improving the algorithm isn't possible.

To overcome the bottleneck a robot needs to be created with human level intelligence. The biggest surprise for computer science students is, that such a technology is available but it works different from normal computer programming. Human level AI can be realized with teleoperation which is a technique used in animatronics. The idea is, that not an algorithm determines what the robot is doing next, but the software transmits the signals from a human operator which stands behind the robot. These robots are working different from search algorithm which are analyzed by computer experts, but they have more in common with a remote controlled crane.

The technology for realizing human like robots consists of a motion capture suite for recording the motion, a motion library which stores the movement in the XML format and a replay module which retrieves the trajectories from the database. Such a system isn't limited by a certain algorithm but the motion database restricts the possible movements. If the database is a larger one, the robot behaves like a human. The term robot programming doesn't mean to invent an algorithm which allows the robot to do an action, but robot programming is equal to fill the database with information. These information are equal to sample trajectories from different demonstrations.

A database of motions is the key element of a robot. It stores recorded motions and it allows to recall existing motions.

**Motion capture database**

An easy to follow tutorial for realizing a complex robotics system is based on the CMU Motion capture database. The file is imported in the bvh format into the blender animation software and then a human character gets animated. The CMU bvh file provides the keyframe and the blender software is rendering the character. If the overall pipeline is connected with the keyboard, the user can activate certain motions like jump and walk.

The interesting point in the pipeline is, that no dedicated algorithm is needed but the robot movements are stored in the bvh file.\[1\] This file is the key element for human like animations.

&#x200B;

**From game logs to motion graphs**

A typical step in creating a game log is realized with the sqlite database. The player's position is stored 10 times a second into the database, together with the frame number and events like “jumping”.\[2\] This produces a large amount of data. In the next step the stored game log is converted into a motion graph. A motion graph is a tree based database in which the information are stored in a semantic order. For example, in the beginning the player has the choice to move to the left, or to the right. Both options are stored in the motion graph. Such a graph structure can be used by a solver to find a path in the action space.

The conversation from a game log into a semantic annotated motion graph isn't defined precisely. It's some sort of alchemy knowledge how to realize the workflow. What we can say for sure is, that learning from demonstration, motion capture and trajectory generation needs a well formatted database in the loop. It's the task of the programmer to make suggestions about the database diagram and specify which field names are needed.

"Robotics Engineer Character ConceptI'm creating my first ever Gurps character with a new group and the GM has put us at a 125 pt limit with 50 pt disadvantage limit. I want to create a character that is somewhat 'Ivory tower' genius, whose specialty is creating small robots with limited AI/programming to perform specific tasks.

I Still need to buy equipment and I think I'm going to use last 10 points to either increase wealth or to get a specialized item aka a pre-campaign built companion robot, I was thinking something like a miniature crow that sat on the PC's shoulder working as a place to store information or comic relief. Any other suggestions/tips are highly welcome.

**Companion Bots:**

**Study bots:** By 2025, it's expected that every child will benefit from an ""Einstein-like"" smart tutor that will customize study plans based on personalized interests and preferred learning methods, reflecting differences between abilities and fast and slow learners. Bots are also in development that can teach muscle memory in the form of a wearable device that can instruct in art, piano or other tasks by haptic feedback, though the effectiveness of this learning method has yet to be proven.

**Therapy bots:** Research using humanoid social robots is underway to evaluate the brain signals of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using EEG and video cameras to record interaction with the robot. ASD affects 1 in 68 children and its early diagnosis has a large impact on treatment efficacy. Moreover, ongoing research has shown that robot-assisted interventions can teach social and academic skills to autistic children, including emotion recognition.

**Friendship bots:** Many companies are specializing in friendship bots in a variety of humanoid and animal forms. The same advances in perceptual and cognitive AI that will benefit other scenarios will increase the sophistication of decision trees and subtle responses to human stimuli, creating either a new member of the family or a companion for warding off loneliness.

**Bionic Bots:**

**Exoskeletons:** Combining mechanics, sensors, AI, and mobile computing, smart exoskeletons are already available, Algorithms in rigid exoskeletons for the shin and foot can customize assisted walking to the wearer. The market for exoskeletons will be worth US$1.89 billion at a CAGR of 41.3%.

**Prosthetics:** With a more specific application than exoskeletons, smart prosthetics are getting smarter, with machine learning able to make the brain-limb connection that automatically conveys the intention of an action to the limb. However, ML isn't the ideal solution for prosthetics, as the wearer needs to ""teach"" the limb a given motion by mentally repeating it over and over again. Current research is focusing on a musculoskeletal computer model that acts as a bridge between the brain and prosthetic. 

**Augmentation devices:** Bionic lenses that can potentially replace the eye's natural lens with camera optics are also on the horizon. This technology would naturally format images, bringing with it an immediate improvement to eyesight and clarity of vision regardless of distance. Over 39 million fully blind people and 246 million people visually impaired people worldwide will benefit from augmenting technologies.

**Butler Bots:**  


Butler bots in various forms can pick up slack and perform basic tasks like folding clothes, vacuuming, and picking things up. In scenarios like fires, gas leaks, or break ins, butler bots can serve a variety of functions: averting them through alerts; performing first response, for example, locking doors, shutting down a gas supply, or activating a home sprinkler system; using embedded cameras to transmit home layouts to the authorities in image, plan, or video form on cloud; and, of course, preventing false alarms. 

Already in 200 million homes around the world, butler bots will continue to learn the preferences and usage habits of individual family members and provide a range of home services for individuals and families based on voice commands, sensors, and apps."
"July 2016: Status Update from Jibo CEO Steve ChambersJibo Family, 

For the past month the team has been focused on preparing for RTM (release to manufacturing) -- which means the factory can begin building the Jibos that will ultimately be delivered to your homes. RTM allows manufacturing to build robots with the launch release hardware, electrical, mechanical and fit-and-finish elements (his great looking exterior!) all in place, as well as a minimum software build that allows OTA (over-the-air) downloads when Jibo arrives in your homes.  

Over the next few months while the manufacturing team is ramping up and building Jibos, we will continue to improve his software to deliver a better overall experience. This means when Jibo arrives in your homes he will first download the latest and greatest software, allowing him to be the best and most up-to-date Jibo he can be.  RTM is an important step in our journey to deliver Jibo to your homes.  

This past month we have been continuing to improve Jibo’s picture and video capture technology, single and multi-user facial tracking, and motion detection. We recently changed one of Jibo’s two eyes (camera lenses) for a narrower-angle lens. The original lens will remain and support wider angle shots, and will be utilized by the perception system for things like motion detection, facial tracking, and more. With the new lens, Jibo will now capture better pictures and videos of your favorite moments, and he’ll remain accurate and reliable when following you to take hands-free pictures.  This is just one example of how we’re continuing to improve Jibo’s capabilities.

On the design front, we’re continuing to bolster the Jibo experience through testing, testing and more testing. This month we invited outside testers into the Jibo offices, to gain additional insight into how Jibo should interact with the family. We received some valuable feedback about things like whether or not Jibo should initiate conversation or small talk, and when it’s appropriate for him to do these things. Design is also hard at work on a new skill that utilizes Jibo’s messaging and content creation capabilities. We will have more details for you soon!

Jibo’s character is what sets him apart from other voice-activated devices on the market and we’re really excited about the developments we’re making in this key area. Jibo’s character allows him to connect with the family in a way no other product or device can, to establish relationships with the people you love. He can get to know your family and keep them close, learn and grow with you, and share in special moments. 

Our Character AI team has been working hard behind the scenes to make Jibo into the lovable companion you all have come to expect. They are currently working on an extensive animation library to empower developers to bring their applications to life in your homes. One of the most important aspects of the Jibo experience is the number of ways he can express himself when interacting with a user, and these developments will keep interactions with Jibo exciting and fresh. In addition to the animation library, we’re working on a number of other ways to bring forth Jibo’s unique character, like greetings:  Jibo will have a number of new ways to greet you in the morning, or after a long day of work, and each will make him feel like part of the family. 

Finally, I’d like to touch on Jibo’s vocal expressions, as they are another important factor in the overall experience with Jibo. As noted in the last message, we’re going to continue to improve Jibo’s voice right up until owners download the latest software when Jibo arrives. We’re also continuing to improve his SSA (semi-speech audio or sound effects) prior to ship. Jibo can convey ideas and emotions with these sound effects more effectively than with speech alone (think R2D2!).

That’s it for this month, stay tuned at the end of next month for the July update where we’ll check in on delivery dates and other important milestones and initiatives. I want to offer one final word on an important milestone that’s upcoming:  Our household beta test.  We will have 2 beta phases, necessary because they’re in-home (that’s important for us to optimize and tune Jibo’s audio algorithmic performance and also to understand family dynamics with Jibo).  Iteration -- or trials or usability studies like these 2 beta phases -- is key to any robot, but especially key to Jibo as a social robot.  

As always, thank you for your support and patience while we bring your Jibo to life. 

Regards, 

Steve Chambers
Jibo CEO"

The world at present is simply tapping into the potential for robotics and all of the ways the sophistication of models and laptop programming can improve the setting and world. Today’s robots are working towards speech recognition, artificial emotions, character, gestures, and social intelligence. Much of the analysis performed now focuses more on what kind of new robots professionals can create and new ways to create them. Through the Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab college students research robotics in relation to natural disasters and each-day life.

Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute AI and Reasoning Lab in New York conducted an experiment the place a robot became conscious of itself, and corrected its reply to a question as soon as it had realised this. The phrase robot was launched to the general public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), printed in 1920. The play begins in a manufacturing unit that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified individuals referred to as robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of those residing creatures, but in their look they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who may be mistaken for people. These mass-produced staff are depicted as efficient however impassive, incapable of authentic pondering and detached to self-preservation.

Mechatronics focuses on the design means of mechatronics combines mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering together with techniques integration and technical project administration. Mechatronics engineering includes the design, construction and operation of automated techniques, robots and intelligent merchandise, which result from the incorporation of software program and hardware. Electrical engineers interested in robotics typically receive an education more focused on the management of robots somewhat than their mechanical design.

A analysis staff in connection with the Lab and the Office of Naval Research’s Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot program developed the world’s first fireplace-fighting humanoid robot. The College of Engineering is house to the Mechanical Engineering division. Related degrees embrace a Master of Science with focus in Robotics, a Professional Master’s in Aerospace, and a PhD in Robotics and System Design.

Various strategies have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One technique is evolutionary robotics, during which a variety of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which carry out best are used as a mannequin to create a subsequent ""generation"" of robots. Another methodology is developmental robotics, which tracks modifications and growth within a single robot in the areas of problem-fixing and different features. Another new type of robot is just recently launched which acts both as a smartphone and robotic and is called RoboHon.

The prospects of robotic autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a sensible concern sooner or later. A robot is a machine—particularly one programmable by a pc— capable of finishing up a complex series of actions mechanically. Robots may be guided by an external control system or the management could also be embedded inside. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human kind, but most robots are machines designed to perform a activity with no regard to their aesthetics.

It’s estimated that there are greater than three million industrial robots in use proper now. These robots usually work in excessive geographical conditions, climate, circumstances, etc.

The concept of automata originates within the mythologies of many cultures all over the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-working machines, some resembling animals and humans. Robots have changed people in performing repetitive and harmful tasks which humans prefer to not do, or are unable to do because of measurement limitations, or which occur in extreme environments such as outer house or the bottom of the ocean. There are considerations about the growing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in rising numbers of capabilities.

Hopkins University presents robotics as either a minor or a Master’s degree by way of their Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). Both programs embody areas of study similar to mechanics, dynamics, kinematics, sign processing, planning, artificial intelligence, control systems, and signal processing. In Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, for instance, students can examine self-driving vehicles, can research and enhance the effectiveness of inexperienced roofing, and can perceive using sensors to assist preserve bridge security.

The addition comes from rethinking the way bendable robots are built: in preference to addition out the way to upload bendable abstracts to a adamant apprentice body, the UC San Diego advisers commenced with a bendable anatomy and added adamant appearance to key components. The structures were aggressive by means of insect exoskeletons, which accept each bendable and adamant components–the advisers alleged their creations “flexoskeletons.”

The new adjustment allows for the structure of bendable equipment for robots in a toddler atom of the time beforehand naked and for a toddler atom of the price.

"Robots: A Brief History&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/792k6d0caym31.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b222c53965362080369629dd114cb6ded5a0cde2

The word 'robot' today refers to stationary or mobile machines of all kinds that perform software-controlled work. This includes industrial robots with [end effectors](https://columbiaokura.com/products/end-effectors/), transport robots, underwater, domestic, combat, etc.

# Let's Go Back In Time

The origin of the word 'robot' belongs to the Czech writer Karel Čapek. In 1920, he published the play R.U.R. Its action takes place in a factory which produces artificial people. They're called robots. In Czech, the word 'robota' means hard labor, hard work, corvee. In 1923, the novel was translated from Czech to English by Paul Selver and adapted for the English scene by Nigel Playfair.

The term 'robot' has become popular primarily due to science fiction novels by American author Isaac Asimov, in which humanoid robots play a central role. Azimov coined the term 'robotics', a scientific field that designs robots. In 1942, he began The Foundation, which later turned into a cycle of seven science fiction novels. He formulated three laws of robotics there:

1. A robot cannot injure or harm anyone by inaction.
2. A robot have to obey human orders unless such orders are contrary to the first law.
3. The robot must protect its existence if this protection doesn't contradict the First or Second Law.

However, the humanoid robots by Chapek and Asimov would rather be called androids today because they have human features.

# Industrial Robots

Since the 1950s, the word 'robots' also refers to software-controlled manipulators — industrial robots which do various tasks. The industrial robot was invented by George Devol who founded the world's first robotics company Unimation in 1956 in the United States together with Joseph F. Engelberger.

These devices are universally applicable automatic drives with several axes the movements of which relative to the sequence of movements and trajectories or angles are freely programmable (without mechanical or human intervention) and possibly controlled by sensors. They can be equipped with grippers, end effectors, tools or other means of production and can carry out loading or unloading or production tasks.

Joint robots are industrial robots working together with people without being separated from them by guards. Such models have existed since the mid-1990s.

# Other Types Of Robots

Despite the fact that most of the robots are used to work in different factories, there are several other devices that are also considered robots. For example, autonomous mobile robots that can conduct polls and sometimes even use them for military purposes.

Even running robots fall into this category. There are also household and service robots that perform the functions of vacuum cleaners, window cleaners or lawnmowers. Or robots that resemble humans and animals. They must adapt and interact with people, for example, to give them information.

Other applications include caring for the elderly and disabled or caring for children. Artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in these social robots because they're designed to flexibly respond to human needs."
"How do we make future machines safe?Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that they’ll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If we’re all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that there’s no difference: this is an idea that’s been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably don’t have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are “happy” in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe we’ll grow comfortable with doing nothing “productive” all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I don’t see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We’ve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a “school” for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a “theory of mind”: it would have to say to itself: “If I perform the action that I’m currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the action’s repercussions, or disapprove?” On a very humble scale, we’re trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. I’d be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyone’s involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

Thanks for reading. ~Josh

[Did you have a strategy for seeming more human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z1kt?context=5)|There were several tactics that I used to try to up the complexity of the interaction.  Here is one, which you could call ""Getting Out of Book.""  Many chatbots, e.g., [Cleverbot\]\(http://cleverbot.com/\), are built from massive databases of past human interactions.  If a piece of dialogue has happened before on the internet, chances are decent that the bot can handle it.  Thus I asked Cleverbot the capital of France—""Paris.""—what two plus two is—""Four.""  I said, ""Never gonna give you up,"" Cleverbot said, ""Never gonna let you down."" I said, ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche,"" Cleverbot said, ""Will you do the fandango?""  I use the metaphor of what for chess computers is called ""the book""—in their case, a giant database of grandmaster games, such that if any of those positions occurs, they don't even have to analyze the position; they just play whatever a grandmaster played in that position.  I sometimes make a comparison between Cleverbot, Deep Blue's ""book,"" and things like *The Mystery Method* or *The Game*, where you have a community collaborating on in effect a giant seduction wiki, where there is a ""best practice"" of what you ought to say when someone says *x*. Something always seemed a little off to me about that approach to flirtation, and the Turing test gives a pretty clear benchmark of how those types of ""social robots"" \(in Neil Strauss's terms\) fall short of what is genuinely interesting and complex about human interaction.  Long story short, the way that Garry Kasparov pioneered the idea of playing offbeat moves to get the computer ""Out of Book,"" I tried as much as possible to steer the conversation into unusual terrain.  Every professional chess game is said to ""begin"" with a move called ""\[the novelty\]\(http://www.radiolab.org/2011/aug/23/rules-set-you-free/\),"" which is the first move that creates a position that's never been played before. It's only then that the players are in a sense really playing.  In conversation, it might be as simple as adding a small personal detail to a stock answer, or making an unusual turn of phrase.  One of the beautiful things about language is how easy it is to say a sentence that's never been said before—e.g., \[see Stephen Fry here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ZFD01r6ersw#t=121s)—and yet on the other hand, like most chess games, we begin from a uniform starting point and a finite series of possible (or at least socially acceptable) moves: ""Hi!"" ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Good thanks!"" The ""novelty"" is the moment, the first sentence, that the conversation breaks out of this boilerplate and becomes a unique linguistic occurrence.  In a Turing test (and, I would argue, in life), the earlier and more frequently you can get this to happen, the better.
[Can you provide an algorithm that even limits the choices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4111j6?context=5)|My feeling is not really.  That what, for example, *The Mystery Method* and PUA forums fail to account for is that communication at its best is completely bespoke and customized to its audience. Performers (Mystery is a magician by training) can hone in on a joke's optimal delivery, because the law of large numbers means that one crowd is likely to resemble another on average—but even then, most comics are amazed at how different the vibe of a room can be from night to night. I'll add that, as far as chess goes, of course there are moves that are objectively superior to other moves, but that highest-level Grandmaster chess is often quite personal(ized). World #1 Magnus Carlsen: ""I am trying to beat the guy sitting across from me, and trying to choose the moves that are most unpleasant for him and his style."" Individual and small-group dialogues are among the most complex, and also the most rich, because of the totally tailored nature of the exchange.
[How were you chosen to compete, what was your strategy heading into the competition, and how did you adapt it as the contest continued along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z451?context=5)|Alan Turing famously predicted that computer programs would be fooling the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000, and that we would come to ""speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"".  This is one of the famous predictions of computer science that didn't come true, but my ears really pricked up in 2008, when the top program managed to fool 3/12 of the judges—25%, or just one vote shy of Turing's prediction. I realized that the next year's test could be the one the computers finally cross that line.  A voice inside me rose up and said, ""Not on my watch."" And so I decided to take it upon myself to personally intercede on behalf of humanity, and see what I could do to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test.  I called up the organizers, starting with the sponsor, the rogue disco dance floor salesman Hugh Loebner, and from there it actually wasn't difficult to persuade the organizers to put my name on the confederate roster.  I said a little about my strategy [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zw6s), but I'm happy to elaborate on a slightly different point.  The medium that the Loebner Prize takes place in is actually a bit unusual, in that you can see each other's typing live on the screen, character by character, backspacing and all.  It occurred to me that this was a major opportunity to bring questions not only of the *content* of the conversation, but also of the *form*, to the forefront of the interaction.  For instance, if you get four good friends together over beers, notice how at a certain point the classic, rigid ""turn-taking"" structure dissolves into a kind of organized chaos of crosstalk, interruption, finishing each other's sentences, each person collaborating by chipping in a few words at a time. It becomes like a kind of quartet, in effect.  And more generally, a lot of the complexity of human conversation isn't simply knowing *what* to say, but *when* to interject, and *how long* to keep talking.  Or when to let someone cut you off, and when to insist on holding the floor.  Live typing brings this whole complicated structural ballet into play.  Whereas the computers were typically content to wait for a full stop or a carriage return before they even started cranking on a reply, I was happy to do what we do when we speak out loud: when a judge made a typo and said ""Hey, how's it ~~giong~~"", I didn't wait as he painstakingly backspaced and rewrote it, I mercifully just jumped in, completed his question, and took the liberty of answering right away. And I generally tried to make it clear, as we do out loud with timed micro-pauses, that I was happy to keep elaborating on an answer as long as the judge liked, but that I was happy to step aside and let them redirect at any time.  This for me was one of the big revelations of the test: that a lot of the complexity of interaction is happening at the *structural* level. It's something to consider when you sit down with your friends or family to dinner tonight: how *little*, in the structural sense, that kind of group interaction resembles something with clearly defined starts, stops, and turn-taking structure—like a more formal mode of conversation...or an internet forum.
[You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down and you see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without your help, but you're not helping. Why is that, Leon?  Also, how would you stop a robot uprising if you had to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zpgk?context=5)|[*angry at the suggestion*] What do you mean, I'm not helping?
[As a ""human"", what is your favorite joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z3j7?context=5)|I saw this wino; he was eating grapes. I was like, Dude, you have to wait.
[Does our natural tendency to ascribe human qualities to inanimate objects skew our perception of artificial intelligence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c412es1?context=5)|I would say absolutely. More broadly this is known as the ""[pathetic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy)"" (not ""pathetic"" as in ""inadequate""; rather from ""pathos"" meaning ""feelings""). But in the case of computers, as you point out, there's much more going on than just the pathetic fallacy, because (a) computers are in fact made by humans, and (b) by and large they are made in our own image. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that from the 1700s through the 1940s, computers *were* human. The word ""computer,"" before it meant the gadgetry humming along in our offices and homes and pockets, meant something else: it was a job description. From the mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering firms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator.  These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley’s comet—early proof of Newton’s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before—to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. It’s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the first time, what exactly these new contraptions were.  Turing’s paper, for instance, describes the unheard-of “digital computer” by making analogies to a human computer: “The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.” In the mid-twentieth century, a piece of cutting-edge mathematical gadgetry was “like a computer.”  But in the twenty-first century, it is the human math whiz that is “like a computer.” In other words: The literal and the figurative have switched places. Perhaps this explains part of why computers make us so existentially anxious.
[If I were to ask you if you were a computer would your answer be the same as your answer to this question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c410qan?context=5)|Error: stack overflow         method ""recursive.question.pronoun.resolve"", line 10, in <module>
[Obviously, seeming ""human"" is a very broad category.  Did you simply try to act like the most ""average"" human, or did you take on a specific character or personality that was off the average? Would being too average make you seem less real?  If you were intentionally off the average, what kind of personality did you take on?  Is there a certain set of character traits that seems most human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c414jpf?context=5)|Great question.  In my case, I tried as much as possible to highlight the fact that I (unlike, e.g., Cleverbot) am the product of a distinct and singular life history.  The contest was held in Brighton, and so when they mentioned Brighton, I compared the city layout to my experience studying abroad in Galway, Ireland and I compared the weather to my time in graduate school in Seattle. So that was part of a broader strategy of not only fielding questions but in effect illustrating how I came to the knowledge or experience that informed my answer.
[Did The Most Artificial Artificial Intelligence also get an award?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4102nf?context=5)|Yes, there is a ""Most Human Computer"" award, which is, in fact, the actual/ostensible point of holding the contest. More on the scoring in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c41045d)
[Did they give out any other awards like ""most human AI program"" or ""least human human""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40znw9?context=5)|Yes to the former; actually I should explain a little bit about how the scoring system works.  You have a panel of judges, who are typically scientists, conversing in rounds of two conversations each: one with a computer, and one with a human. After each round the judges decide which they thought was which, but they also make a confidence judgment of how certain they are of their decision, on a sliding scale.  Thus at the end of the day all of the contestants, man and machine, can be ranked according to the total amount of confidence they inspired in the judges.  Each year, the program that comes away with the highest score wins the ""Most Human Computer"" award.  This comes with several thousand dollars and a bronze medal—Alan Turing's face on one side, and sponsor, the rogue plastic portable light-up disco dance floor baron Hugh Loebner's, on the other.  My ""Most Human Human"" award, sadly, came with only a paper certificate and bragging rights.
[Seeing as I am wearing my ""I failed the Turing Test"" I feel obligated to ask you a question.  How complex is your software, are you a simple program capable of running on any desktop computer, or do you require some kind of small super computer? I take it you probably require lots of storage correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4155z9?context=5)|Turing in 1950 estimated that a computer with 1 GB of memory could fool the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000.  Looks like that might have been a little optimistic.
[Would you say that acting more like a computer would be a good tactic since the judges would expect a computer to act more like a human? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c412kco?context=5)|Judge: How are you?     elbot: Just a moment! I'll start my self-diagnosis algorithm and let you know the results...     judge: Very funny, that's exactly what you'd say if you were a computer, right? May be I need one of those?     elbot: My condition code is hexadecimal 40A1F. That means 'fine'.     judge: What do u think of having machines take over the world?     elbot: Fix it up a bit first. Then I'll take it over.

"Where do I learn more about Social Robotics / Social AI?I love learning about social robotics and what they mean for our society. Stories like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner, 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror, all contain ideas I love about how robots/AI affect our society. I love thinking about how these stories are also criticisms of the direction of our society. I love looking at how the robots on the forefront of today are affecting the world. I love thinking of how different cultures perceive the same robots differently. I love questioning how you should design a UI based on the background of the user. I love asking the questions of: can robots feel emotions?, should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?, should we fear artificial intelligence?

I want to find resources/websites/people/subreddits where conversations, and even better, debates over these ideas happen. I've become very frustrated in this pursuit so far, so I'm wondering if there's anyone here who may be able to help. For some context, I'm an undergraduate at a university in the US and I've taken some classes on ethics in technology but I don't feel they're advanced enough for me. They do ask these sort of questions, however, I feel they don't go very in depth with them. They kind of just ask students these questions to get them started thinking about them. Most of the students in these classes tend to have not thought of these ideas before, and these classes are kind of introducing these questions to them; Whereas I like thinking about them all the time and revisiting these ideas with every a tech news headline that comes out. I'm working on trying to find professors and other students at my university that are also interested in these ideas, but I am wondering if there's also resources online you all may know about that may be helpful in my process. Let me know what you guys think, thanks.

&#x200B;

PS.. Here is my take on the some of the questions above:

Can robots/AI feel emotions?

Yes and No. I don't believe that we as humans shouldn't be worried too much about whether robots/AI can or cannot inherently ""feel"" emotion, because I think emotions lie in the eyes of the observer. Let me explain. If a robot is able to mimic the emotions of humans to the level of which it is believable, and we as humans perceive them as real emotions, then they are real emotions. Emotions are not real until we think they are real. When we as people start believing that the robot/AI has felt an emotion, then it has. Because what matters isn't necessarily whether it is literally true or not, but rather what we believe to be true or not. Here is the video clip that taught and inspired me on this from Lex Fridman: [https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603](https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603)

Should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?

This question is largely the question of the film 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror. My answer is: there is no objective answer, because AI, like all technology is a tool. What is a tool? A tool is creation that is made to help us achieve a goal better, or faster than before. For example, a wrench is a tool, a car is a tool, a gun is a tool, chatGPT is a tool. The outcome of what is done with these tools can be debated as good or bad, but the tool itself was only a means to the goal. With that being said, an AI that is able replicate a person who was once alive, can be used as a tool to: help someone grieve the lost of a loved one, let someone finish their will, allow malicious people to still be able to spread hate... and so on. The point is, the technology is just a tool, and it is not inherently good or bad. To generalize a piece of technology as either is wrong."

"""The other question: can and should robots have rights? - Ethics and Information Technology"" (2017)> Abstract
> This essay addresses the other side of the robot ethics debate, taking up and investigating the question “Can and should robots have rights?” The examination of this subject proceeds by way of three steps or movements. We begin by looking at and analyzing the form of the question itself. There is an important philosophical difference between the two modal verbs that organize the inquiry—can and should. This difference has considerable history behind it that influences what is asked about and how. Second, capitalizing on this verbal distinction, it is possible to identify four modalities concerning social robots and the question of rights. The second section will identify and critically assess these four modalities as they have been deployed and developed in the current literature. Finally, we will conclude by proposing another alternative, a way of thinking otherwise that effectively challenges the existing rules of the game and provides for other ways of theorizing moral standing that can scale to the unique challenges and opportunities that are confronted in the face of social robots.

Designing AI for Explainability and Verifiability: A Value Sensitive Design Approach to Avoid Artificial Stupidity in Autonomous Vehicles - International Journal of Social Robotics
"Building Ethical Robots for the Public Sector – Can we take human behavior as the starting point?Increasingly, we can observe that autonomous robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used in public services. 

These high levels of automation can improve quality and efficiency of public processes substantially. In contrast, these autonomous robots and AI need to operate in such way that their actions and decisions meet our ethical expectations. This is in particular relevant for public services, as principles like transparency, fair and equal treatment of all citizens, accountability, and benevolence for citizens are cornerstones of well-functioning public administrations in democratic societies.

While it is obvious that we need ethical robots and AI in public services, it is less obvious to determine how we can assure that autonomous systems reliably meet these ethical expectations. 

In recent years, scientific literature has increasingly focused on this challenge. However, the vast majority of this literature builds on the inherent assumption that ethical standards for human behavior are a good reference framework to set ethical standards for autonomous systems. Nevertheless, robots and AI have substantially different strengths and weaknesses, compared to human decision making.

Against this background, we tested the equivalence hypothesis, which states that people have the same ethical expectations for autonomous robots as for humans.

In five different experiments, the evidence speaks mainly in favor of this **ethical equivalence hypothesis**. This means that – in most cases – respondents do not evaluate robot behavior as more (or less) unethical, compared to when the same behavior would be from humans. However, we do find some differences for specific cases.

Hence, for scientists as well as for practitioners, we recommend (1) that ethical standards for humans are a good starting point to develop standards for autonomous systems, but (2) that a case-by-case approach is needed to evaluate whether this strategy can indeed be applied to many different applications of AI and autonomous robots in the public sector.

"what artificial intelligence means?Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, decision-making, and pattern recognition. AI is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

The concept of AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in computer processing power and data analytics have accelerated its development and made it more accessible to businesses and individuals alike. AI is now being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and speech recognition software to customer service chatbots and medical diagnosis tools.

Despite its many potential benefits, AI also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement, bias in decision-making algorithms, and the risk of unintended consequences. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to grapple with these issues and ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole. 

How AI Works and Its Types:

AI systems are typically designed to learn from large datasets and use statistical algorithms to identify patterns and insights that can be used to automate tasks or make predictions. There are several types of AI, including:

1. Reactive Machines: These AI systems are designed to react to specific inputs, but they do not have the ability to form memories or use past experiences to inform their actions. Examples of reactive machines include chess-playing computers and voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa.

2. Limited Memory: These AI systems can store and recall past experiences, which allows them to make more informed decisions based on past data. Examples of limited memory AI include self-driving cars and fraud detection algorithms.

3. Theory of Mind: These AI systems can understand and predict human behavior, emotions, and intentions, which allows them to interact more effectively with humans. Examples of theory of mind AI include virtual assistants and social robots.

4. Self-Aware: These AI systems have human-like consciousness and self-awareness, which allows them to experience emotions and make decisions based on personal preferences. While this type of AI is still largely theoretical, some experts believe that it could be achieved in the future.

The Benefits and Risks of AI:

AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

1. Improved Efficiency: AI systems can automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow efficiency, freeing up time for humans to focus on more complex tasks.

2. Better Decision-Making: AI can help humans make better decisions by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and insights that might be missed by human analysts.

3. Enhanced Safety: Self-driving cars and other AI-powered devices have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, leading to safer and more efficient transportation systems.

However, there are also many risks associated with AI, including:

1. Job Displacement: As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, there is a risk that many workers may be left without jobs.

2. Bias: AI algorithms can be biased by the data they are trained on, which can result in discriminatory outcomes that reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities.

3. Unintended Consequences: The complex nature of AI systems means that they can be difficult to predict, leading to unintended consequences that may harm individuals or society as a whole.

Conclusion

AI is an exciting and rapidly evolving field with the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. While it offers many benefits, it also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy AI systems, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to work together to ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole."
"Robotics AI: The Future of Automation 

Robotics AI, or artificial intelligence in robotics, has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. It involves the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks autonomously, with the ability to perceive, reason, and learn from their environment.

One of the most significant benefits of robotics AI is its potential to increase efficiency and productivity in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. With intelligent machines, repetitive and mundane tasks can be automated, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.

Robots equipped with AI can also improve safety in hazardous environments, such as mining or nuclear power plants. They can operate in conditions that are too dangerous for human workers, reducing the risk of injury or loss of life.

The development of robotics AI is driven by advances in machine learning and computer vision. With machine learning, robots can adapt to new situations and learn from experience, improving their ability to perform tasks over time. Computer vision enables robots to perceive and interpret visual data, allowing them to navigate and interact with their environment.

There are several types of robots that can benefit from AI, including industrial robots, service robots, and social robots. Industrial robots are typically used in manufacturing and assembly lines, while service robots can be used in healthcare or hospitality settings. Social robots are designed to interact with humans in social contexts, such as education or entertainment.

However, the development of robotics AI also raises ethical concerns. As robots become more intelligent and autonomous, there is a risk of job displacement and income inequality. There are also concerns about the potential for robots to be used for harmful purposes, such as military applications or surveillance.

Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of robotics AI are vast. With the development of intelligent machines, we can improve efficiency, safety, and quality of life for people around the world. The future of automation is here, and it’s powered by robotics AI.

"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|
|GPT-3 (davinci-001)|May 2020|40%|3.5 years|
|GPT-3 (davinci-002)|January 2022|70%|6 years|
|GPT-3.5 (davinci-003)|November 2022|90%|7 years|
|GPT-4|March 2023|95%|Adult|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."
"Sex Robots and WestworldI am currently enrolled on a Posthumanism module as part of a Masters (MA) in Cultural and Critical Studies. The module covers a range of viewpoints on Posthumanism including Transhumanism and post-anthropocentric/interspecies, etc. This week's topic was 'Androids' and we had a set text to read which is a critical posthuman-feminist analysis of sex robots. Alongside this we were asked to watch the first episode of Westworld. I wrote up my thoughts and thought I would share them here as I don't have many people to discuss this topic with! The post contains a small spoiler for Westworld ep1-2. I posted [this article on Medium](https://jamrock.medium.com/thoughts-sex-robots-and-westworld-1049323a150) where I am tweaking it and updating the links. I have pasted below with minimal formatting for those who do not wish to leave Reddit :)

**Thoughts: Sex Robots and Westworld**

As part of our teaching on the Posthumanism module, there were two activities to complete ahead of this week’s lecture on ‘Androids’.

* Watch ‘The Original’ episode/pilot of Westworld (2016)
* Read Neda Atanasoski and Kalindi Vora, “Epilogue: On Technological Desire, Or Why There Is No Such Thing as a Feminist AI”, in Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures (London: Duke University Press, 2019, pp. 188–196)

I read the extract above before I watched the episode of Westworld. The reading really influenced the way I viewed Westworld through a posthumanism lens (and likely reason that our professor set us these tasks). This post is not intended as an academic review of either the article or Westworld but simply a way to quickly gather my thoughts before the lecture. Although the term robots is used in the article, I use the distinction provided by our professor that android is the correct term for a robot that has a humanlike appearance.

Atanasoski and Vora met as postdoctoral scholars who shared an office in the Anthropology Department at Berkeley in 2007. It became evident from their daily interactions that their interests were leading to a collaborative project on race, technology, and politics which led to the publication, in 2019, of their joint work Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures.

From the Westworld Wiki the following summary of the series is useful for the purpose of this post:

>The series is a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin. Set at the intersection of the near future and the re-imagined past, it explores a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.

The Westworld series features lifelike Androids that are programmed with scripts or narratives that they enact as ‘Hosts’ within an immense adventure park for ‘Guests’. The Guests can enjoy an immersive experience while choosing to indulge their boldest or darkest fantasies. This frequently involves the androids (Hosts) being brutally beaten or killed. The androids are also used for sex as passive encounters e.g. a ‘girlfriend experience’ as ‘brothel workers’ or as victims of sexual assault and rape.

The Atanasoski and Vora article discusses various type of ‘lifelike’ sex robots currently being developed and enhanced through advanced robotics, virtual reality and advanced programming of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI). An example of one company creating these androids is Realbotix and their RealDoll product. The creator (an artist and sculptor) of these androids, Matt McMullen, seeks to enhance his ‘silicon sculptures’ with AI to ‘create a genuine bond between man and machine’. Through a simple posthumanism lens there would be much to explore here but the authors introduce a strong postcolonial feminism reading, drawing on the work of black scholar, Hortense Spillers. The authors express clearly the question they are setting out to analyse:

>We argue that the design imaginaries behind **commercial sex robotics represent a technoliberal update to a racial history entangling the desire for “a carefully calibrated sentience” in an artificial person with a desire for property**. Hortense Spillers has asserted that slavery renders the body of the enslaved as flesh, as non-subject. **This desire we raise for analysis in this epilogue is for sex with animate objects that resemble human beings in ways that keep them nonautonomous, yet simulate pleasure, and therefore simulate consent.** We ask: What stands behind the technoliberal desire to engineer the simulation of reciprocity and pleasure into sex robots, and is it connected to the history of racial slavery and its postslavery aftermath at work within US racial liberalism?

I found it impossible to watch Westworld without having this question forefront in my mind when viewing the ways that Guests enacted violence on Hosts, especially given the time-period and location of Westworld in ‘the old West’. Atanasoski and Vora later draw further on Spiller

>The desire for something or someone that has been reduced to pure body, whether as a site of sexual desire or even as a companion, as in the example of Ishiguro’s robots, recollects Hortense Spillers’ observation that the history of US racial slavery permanently marked “various centers of human and social meaning,” specifically through her theorization of the political consequences of **the reduction to pure body of the captive African under US racial slavery. The technoliberal desire for the simulation of pleasure and reciprocity in sex robots is a desire for the simulation of consent from a site where subjectivity is structurally made to be impossible**

Spillers’ distinguishing of body and flesh is worth briefly expanding upon and here I am citing Vincent Lloyd’s article on Spillers:

>Spillers distinguishes between the body, ruled by cultural norms that include prescribed gender markings and performances, and the flesh, the unformed body, not even individuated. Turning African bodies into flesh, making them available to the slave market, involves physical violence. **As flesh, the enslaved are not seen as having personalities, are not seen as subjects of ethics**. They are interchangeable objects; if they differ it is in height and mass, like any other object — unlike a human. **As pieces of flesh, the enslaved are seen as incapable of relationships, incapable of kinship**. Taking the baby from the arms of its mother is thinkable if both are mere flesh.

This division of ‘body and flesh’ appears similar to Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben’s concept of bare life expressed through a distinction he described using the Ancient Greek terms zoē and bios. Bios described the form or manner in which life is lived while zoē is the reductionist biological act of simply being alive or existing. Agamben’s ‘bare life’ refers to when the biological fact of existing is given priority over the way a life is lived. An example of ‘bare life’ for Agamben was seen in the experiences of Auschwitz. I read this as synonymous with Spillers’ description of enslaved Africans reduced to a life of ‘flesh’.

The beating and sexual exploitation of the android Hosts in Westworld appears not to raise ethical concerns in the minds of the Guests as the androids are ‘not human’. The dehumanisation of the subject underpinned the racialised abuse, physical and sexual, of enslaved Africans which is one reason I found watching Westworld unsettling. The ‘human-ness’ or otherwise of androids is a topic that surfaces in Westworld and the in the development of sex robots. McMullen explains in a documentary the authors reference that he wants his SexDoll products to ‘appear clearly as dolls’ to avoid evoking ‘uncanny valley’ syndrome in customers. Uncanny valley describes “a hypothesis which holds that when features look and move almost but not exactly like human beings it causes a response of revulsion among some observers.” A quick Google search validated my understanding that this applies to androids as well as people who have undergone extreme cosmetic surgery.

>The uncanny valley is a term used to describe the relationship between the human-like appearance of a robotic object and the emotional response it evokes. In this phenomenon, **people feel a sense of unease or even revulsion in response to humanoid robots that are highly realistic**. \[…\] Casual observers also tend to describe **a vague eeriness when looking at an individual who looks radically different after cosmetic surgery.**

In *The Original* episode of Westworld there is a discussion between characters responsible for manufacturing the Hosts relating to a new characteristic that has been programmed to make the androids more lifelike. These ‘reveries’ allow Hosts to draw upon ‘previous experiences’. The enhancement is explained by their creator as introducing “the tiny things that make Hosts so real \[and\] make the guests fall in love with them”. Later in the episode, this development is questioned with one character complaining “He keeps making them more real, is that really what people want? \[…\] This place works because the guests know the Hosts aren’t real.” In the second episode a guest is confused by the appearance of a woman who welcomes him, asking “are you real?”. The response from the woman is “if you can’t tell, does it matter?”.

Returning to Atanasoski and Vora and the question of whether or not it matters, the authors ask the following question:

>Could the drive to develop sex robotics mark a translation and projection of a white supremacist destructive economy of desire into the indefinite and supposedly postrace future dreamed up and avowed by techno-liberalism?

The language used by the characters in Westworld supposes a not-too-distant future where the answer to their question is affirmatively answered. The staff of the park in Westworld joke in episode two about guests “raping and pillaging” and discuss decommissioning a female android because guests are losing interest in having sex with her. The dehumanisation of the androids, no matter that they appear lifelike and exhibit increasing signs of sentience, justifies their use as objects to be assaulted. To make a final concluding point I am going to slightly tweak the words of Spillers to describe the plight of Westworld’s android Hosts.

>As **machines**, the enslaved are not seen as having personalities, are not seen as subjects of ethics. As pieces of **machinery**, the enslaved are seen as incapable of relationships, incapable of kinship.

While this debate could be contested for anthropomorphising androids, the question is really about the dynamic and power structures that are encoded into the creation and commodification of “sex robots” for example what Shirley MacWilliam has described as ‘Turning Women into Dead Body Objects’. In other words much of the argument is not about the ethics of harming ‘objects’ but the ongoing concern with harm to women.

I uncovered many supporting resources which I will briefly list before the references supporting this post.

"I am philosopher Shannon Vallor - AMA about philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies!**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**


I am [Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/), the William J. Rewak S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, where I have taught since 2003. 

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay); I worked full-time during my college years at a Cal State university, going to school for a Psychology degree, mostly at night. Like many undergrads, I had no particular interest in or understanding of philosophy until I happened to take an evening course in the Fall of my junior year that satisfied a general ed requirement for the B.A.: a course in applied ethics. Something clicked immediately and forcefully.  I upended my entire life to switch over to a philosophy major, taking negotiated breaks from my job to drive to the required PHIL courses offered only during the day, and then going back to work until late evenings to make up the time. My focus as an undergrad was eclectic; philosophy of science and Husserlian phenomenology consumed me the most. I knew grad school was what I wanted, but to get there I had to ignore the warnings of several senior faculty who advised me kindly but firmly that: A) one simply does not go to grad school to study philosophy of science AND phenomenology, as these are mutually exclusive intellectual passions; and B) one definitely does not try to do so as a woman graduating from what is essentially a commuter university, because you have two strikes against you already. 

With the help of luck, pigheadedness, and some very opportune GRE scores, I managed to worm my way into the Ph.D. program at Boston College, where I thrived. Most fortunate of all was my discovery of a mentor in Richard Cobb-Stevens, possibly the kindest soul I have ever met, and one of the few I could have found who wrote on Husserl and analytic philosophy. He wholeheartedly encouraged my disdain for the arbitrary constraints of the analytic/continental ‘divide.’ I also managed to get a fine education in the philosophy and history of science from I.B. Cohen, who was in the habit of crossing the river from Harvard to teach grad seminars at BC. Virtue ethics was a brand new passion I picked up in grad school. And while I could never make myself love Heidegger the way Bill Richardson wanted me to, I did manage to pick up an interest in the philosophy of technology through a seminar he taught that explored Heidegger’s influence on that field.

I wrote my dissertation on the philosophy of reference in Husserl and the analytic tradition; I was interested in how the former could address some of the challenges of the latter, and I thought this had significant implications for referential practices, ontology and realism in science. I published two pieces from the dissertation in relatively obscure venues (later discovering that one of them somehow made its way into a graduate linguistics course at Stony Brook). Later, I published an article in Inquiry of which I was quite proud, engaging the debate between van Fraassen and Hacking on instrumental realism and scientific ‘unobservables’ from a phenomenological perspective. Another article in Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences took on Dennett’s abuses of phenomenology and the notion of scientific evidence. But once I started on the tenure-track teaching the philosophy of science at Santa Clara University, I quickly realized that trying to publish at the intersections of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of language or science meant fighting a very strong current. Most journals sent back my work without review, saying either that they didn’t publish ‘continental’ work, or that they published only continental work. 

Around the same time, in 2007, I had started teaching a new undergrad course called “Science, Technology and Society,” into which I drew a great deal of philosophy of technology, and some applied ethics. I was dumbfounded by the enthusiastic response of my students, who acted like they had been stranded in the desert and I had just shown up with a water fountain. They were dealing with the advent of smartphones, Facebook, and other new social media, and their relationships and habits were changing in ways they could not fully articulate, but knew were ethically, politically and epistemically transformative. I decided to write something about how new social media were reshaping our communicative habits, and thus almost certainly our communicative virtues and vices. I presented it at a workshop on technology and the ‘good life’ in the Netherlands, where advanced research in technology ethics abounds, and found that my work also resonated among the scholars there; soon after, philosophers and ethicists of technology became my primary research community. 

This was not only for pragmatic, selfish reasons. While I did benefit, tenure-wise, from having a new group of journals that were happy to publish the new kind of work I was doing, I also recognized that my research in the ethics of emerging technologies was of far more immediate social and political importance than the sort of research I had been doing. I told myself that I could return to my phenomenological and epistemological fascinations at any time (and I still do dabble in them), but I reasoned that work on the ethical impact of new media, military and social robotics, artificial intelligence, biomedical enhancement, and pervasive digital surveillance needed to be done now, by as many good philosophers as are equipped and motivated to take it on. Almost a decade has passed since I made that decision, and time has not proved me wrong. As the current President of the [Society for Philosophy and Technology](http://www.spt.org/), Executive Board member of the [Foundation for Responsible Robotics](http://responsiblerobotics.org/), and member of the [IEEE Standards Association’s Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in the Design of Autonomous Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html), I have watched the international demand for rigorous research in this area explode.

And yet, philosophy and ethics of technology remains a relatively under-studied and undervalued field in the United States. The problem is not one of social need or interest; being in Silicon Valley, I and many of my peers are invited to speak to policymakers, tech companies and professional groups of software developers, roboticists, and engineers more often than our schedules permit. Yet philosophy departments in the U.S. still employ very few philosophers of technology and tech ethicists, and even fewer in top research positions. In Europe and the U.K., the situation is significantly better, and my research has benefited greatly from a strong network of good friends and research partners in those countries.

I have also been fortunate enough to enter into a great relationship with Oxford University Press, who last year published my first book, the culmination of almost a decade of research into virtue ethics as a normative framework for thinking about emerging technologies: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&). In the first part of the book, I make the case for virtue ethics as the richest and most adaptable normative framework for crafting a set of global norms and practices that will permit the human family to survive and flourish with new technologies. In the second part of the book, I give the reader a brief tour of the fundamental moral practices of self-cultivation found in three distinct classical virtue traditions: Aristotelian ethics, Confucian ethics and Buddhist ethics, and I show how these practices today can support the contemporary need to cultivate what I call the technomoral virtues. These are virtues of moral character and intelligence that are specifically adapted to the needs of living well with emerging technologies, and to coping with the increasing complexity and opacity of the technosocial future that poses such an acute epistemic challenge to practical wisdom. In the third part of the book, I apply the framework developed in Part Three to four specific domains of emerging technology: new social media, pervasive digital surveillance and self-tracking, military and social robotics, and biomedical human enhancement. The aim of the book is to highlight a practical path to cultivating the technomoral wisdom that can give the human family its best shot at continued flourishing on this planet.

Since the book was written, my work has focused more narrowly on the ethical implications of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. I am happy to have a co-authored chapter with computer scientist George Bekey coming out in a new version of the stellar Robot Ethics volume being edited by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney and Ryan Jenkins, and my next book will devote significant attention to artificial intelligence and its ethical and political implications. I am also increasingly interested in the immense challenges and opportunities that emerging technologies present for the cultivation of civic virtues, and for the democratic flourishing those virtues enable. While the civic virtues of ‘public character’ received significant attention in my first book, I underestimated how quickly our growing deficit of public character would endanger our democratic institutions and our liberties. I expect to be thinking through these challenges for many years to come.

My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

"Hi! I wrote a paper on Bee for a homework assignment! Want to read it?\*\*This may be a spoiler for people\*\*

&#x200B;

I thought I would post this here because I've been a fan of the show since 2019.

I am an engineering grad student involved in robotics and got to write a short essay on a robot presented in media. I definitely wrote this last minute (don't procrastinate like me) but it was fun and I am curious about what you guys might add to it

  

A Critical Analysis of a Humanoid Robot, Bee from the Animated Series *Bee and PuppyCat* 

Human-Robot Interaction in Community Health

K. Banks

  

Introduction

*Bee and PuppyCat* is an animated television series with science-fiction and fantasy storytelling elements. However, the show is grounded with charming details of everyday life. From grocery shopping to space battles, viewers are invited into the world of the protagonist, Bee. I first watched the original series in 2019 and I am now rewatching the show with a new perspective. The character was revealed to be a robot in the finale of the original series and many episodes foreshadow her mechanical nature. The series is character-driven, founded on themes such as loneliness and loss. Despite the light-hearted aesthetic, the mature themes contribute to an interpretation of how humanoid robots can fit into a community and the ethical implications of building long-term relationships.

Description of Robot Characteristics

Bee is presented as an eccentric young woman living with her pet and friend PuppyCat in an island community. With each episode, viewers can begin to notice two things. She has capabilities that no other character presents, and the other characters are aware of her and her pet’s strangeness. Out of earshot, she is sometimes referred to as the “little old girl lady,” for example, because she never ages. She exhibits superhuman strength and can withstand fire and large impacts. She enjoys food and sleep, but it is not shown that she needs either to survive. She also has memories of her childhood implying that she has highly advanced artificial intelligence based on the consciousness of a real person. Bee celebrates her birthday with her ""Dad Box"", a creation by her father to help her feel less lonely. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, when she hurts her arm the “Dad Box” repairs her. 

Discussion of Historical Context

The original series was released on YouTube under Cartoon Hangover as a series of 10 seven-minute shorts in 2014 and was later produced as 16 full-length episodes in 2019. Recently, Netflix released the series in 2022 with an additional 3 episodes, causing a resurgence in popularity. In an interview with Comics Alliance the creator Natasha Allegri stated the work is made for an adult female audience. Bee models the target demographic, designed to be likable and relatable. The modern time period of the show contributes to a positive and normalized attitude toward technology. Although the characters notice Bee’s differences, they remain polite and subtle in their reactions. Similarly, the focus of the show is not the technology but rather the context of the technology in the face of challenges. The series re-releasing amid a dwindling pandemic is also relevant. She fulfills a role as a social robot and a task robot, fulfilling numerous temporary job assignments that leverage her emotional and physical capabilities. 

Ethical Issues

Throughout the series, it alludes to how Bee became sick as a child and that her father is the one who built her as she is, hence the “Dad Box”. The father is mentioned in flashbacks, but enough time has passed where it is unknown where her father is and other characters begin to wonder why Bee does not age.  It seems he built her as a way to cope with his child’s terminal illness. Is it ethical to use a human consciousness to develop humanoid robots? The answer may lie in consent and purpose. The scenario also raises the question of what happens to a caregiver or social robot personalized to a user when it lasts longer than the user. Would family and friends of the user find it acceptable to repurpose the robot or would they view it as an extension of their loved one? Integrating technology into a society leads to the risk of viewing technology as extensions of others and extensions of ourselves.

Discussion of Robot Acceptance and Trust Factors

The story also relates to a discussion on social robots designed to mimic empathy and emotional relationships. In “Designing Ethical Social Robots— A Longitudinal Field Study with Older Adults” one concern with social robots is damaging the emotional and mental health of the user through perceived deception. When characters learn Bee is not human they are not shocked as much as they are heartbroken. They no longer view her in the same way. This implies that she was human enough to build valuable relationships and although she did not change, the perception of her did. There is a question of whether a relationship between a robot and a person can be as valuable as a relationship between two people. The show claims that acceptance relies on perception.

Evaluation of Dynamics of the Human-Robot Relationships

It is easy to say that characters in the show accepted Bee because she appears human. As an optimistic, bubbly character her appearance is trustworthy in that she looks harmless despite her immeasurable strength. She is designed from the perspective of her Dad, a parent who made difficult ideas into games with prizes. Her interactions with others mirror her father’s parenting in that she maintained a positive and supportive attitude. The perception of Bee relied on incorporating robotic capabilities into a kind and familiar personality. 

Consideration Of Implications for Robots in Community Health

The analysis of Bee as a robot raises questions about a possible conflict between minimizing deception and increasing acceptance in social robots. Improving acceptance through design can imply deception by altering expectations with a lack of visual information. Sleek and naturalistic robot design may improve acceptance but could also misrepresent the technological capabilities. As robotics become more advanced and complex, this could be an issue for acceptance of the correct user groups or lead to an underestimation of the risks of the technology. In a community health setting, technology with an understanding of human movement and speaking style is suggested to improve human interaction, being requested features by focus groups in the aforementioned study. Perhaps modeling a caregiver robot after a loved one would improve acceptance in older adults, although the ethical implications must be considered.

Conclusion

Robots are not likely to serve as replacements for loved ones in the near future, but they can bring comfort and ease to a community. In *Bee and PuppyCat,* Bee’s constant positive presence in the face of hardship was valuable to those around her. She fought beings ten times her size and put out fires with her bare hands, but I would say her most impactful contribution was the long-term relationships she built with people. Although they felt alienated upon learning she is not human, they remained by her side. Long-term interactions with technology have risks but the benefits would be a resilient relationship built on a foundation of trust and familiarity.

"UPCOMING AMA Friday 18th October: John Danaher, author of ""Automation and Utopia: Human Flourishing in a World without Work""Here's John's [About page](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/p/about.html) from his website

>>Who am I?
>>I like to imagine, navigate and analyse the future of humanity. I am currently an academic and lecturer at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Galway. I teach in the School of Law. I am also an affiliate scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies.

>>My research deals primarily with the ethical, social and legal implications of emerging technologies, but dances around some other philosophical topics. In the past I have written papers about social robots, the risks of advanced AI, the meaning of life and the future of work, the ethics of human enhancement, the intersection between law and neuroscience, the utility of brain-based lie detection, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of religion.

He'll be here to talk about this book he's authored - [Automation and Utopia: Human Flourishing in a World without Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674984242/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0)

He's also previously co-authored - [Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262036681/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1)

**The AMA will be (in a separate post from this) on Friday 18th October at 12:00 ET**"

"Researchers promote sex robots that can turn down sex with their owners ***‘Divorced from reality,’ says critical law professor***

Are “virtuous sex robots” the way of the future? University researchers suggest that robots created for human pleasure should be designed so that they can grant or withhold consent, as well as teach sex education.

Anco Peeters, a doctoral student at Australia’s University of Wollongong, and Pim Haselager, associate professor at The Netherlands’ Radboud University, [**published**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335986790_Designing_Virtuous_Sex_Robots) “Designing Virtuous Sex Robots” in the International Journal of Social Robotics last month.

The paper examined four areas: “virtue ethics and social robotics,” “Contra instrumentalist accounts,” “Consent practice through sex robots” and “Implications of virtuous sex robots.”

The authors do not focus on child sex robots or sex robots that play into rape fantasies, but “the potential positive aspects of intimate human–robot interactions through the cultivation of virtues.”

They argue that robots can be designed to help humans become more virtuous: either by exhibiting virtuous behavior or “nudging human behavior directly.”

"Robotics learning material for upper secondary educational purposes.Digitalents Helsinki has cooperated with Futurice's Chilicorn Fund to build a 3D printed InMoov robot. The experience gained through this project has been documented in this learning material for upper secondary educational purposes.The first part of the material focuses on Social Robots and Ethics.

This learning material is free and you can download it through this link: https://spiceprogram.org/open-robotics/index.html

We’re releasing more learning materials in the near future and will announce them for example [here](https://www.facebook.com/digitalentshelsinki/)!"
"How do we make future machines safe?Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that they’ll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If we’re all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that there’s no difference: this is an idea that’s been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably don’t have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are “happy” in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe we’ll grow comfortable with doing nothing “productive” all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I don’t see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We’ve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a “school” for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a “theory of mind”: it would have to say to itself: “If I perform the action that I’m currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the action’s repercussions, or disapprove?” On a very humble scale, we’re trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. I’d be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyone’s involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

Thanks for reading. ~Josh

"BridgesI read /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit's sweet meditation on how small things can bridge the gaps between us - a shower, [a bowl of water](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/ga2934/a_bowl_of_water/), an apple... And yet again, my comment grew into it's own story. He's done that to me before - he's a very low-keyed writer about high-keyed situations. Me, I like reading about bridges between cultures, but I'm one of those people who stares into the abyss under the bridge. Never going to Royal Gorge again - you can see all the way down between gaps in the bridge deck. Speaking of gaps:

# Bridges

**Rats**

I was stuck in an old, concrete French bunker 10 clicks south of the DMZ at Dong Ha in late 1968. It was just me and two South Vietnamese *pháo binh* (artillery) officers, a young *Thiếu Úy* (2nd Lieutenant) and an OLD *Trung Úy* (1st Lieutenant).  I dunno, hard to tell with Asians - but either he was pushing 50 or he'd had a hard life, maybe both. We were clearing fires between our Area of Operation (AO) and the Marines to the left and right of us.

We were living in downtown Dong Ha in an old French base that was HQ for a reinforced regiment (soon to be a division) of ARVNs, the South Vietnamese Army, but was most memorably the home of about 20,000 hairy-tailed Vietnamese rats. The rats helped us bond - rat-watch is serious business.

When I finally left Dong Ha, I had to shake two momma rats out of the two fuzzy metal-one-quart canteen covers attached to my butt pack. I turned the whole assembly over to my battery Supply Sergeant at Quang Tri, and told him about the previous tenants - one mamma left some little squirmy rat-babies behind. I had shaken it out, but they were sticky little buggers. Might have missed one.

The Supply Sergeant edged away from me far enough to establish a ""social distance"" between us, put on gloves and carried the nasty pack to the burn pit. Told me it was a ""combat loss."" In a way. Fine by me.

Sorry. Got carried away by rat hate. Back to Dong Ha.

**Face to Face**

We all got along in the bunker. The *Thiếu Úy*'s English was pretty good. And he could put on an American-face without too much effort.

Hard to explain the concept of ""face"" - I'm not sure I fully understood it anyway. The short definition of ""face"" was the process of maintaining personal dignity, not showing any emotion in front of strangers. Or friends either - not in public anyway. People who grinned and laughed a lot in public or private were considered idiotic, mentally deranged in an offensive way. Fools with no personal pride in themselves.

So yeah, Americans looked like fools and idiots to them. Which was a problem. We were *very* loud, laughed and talked alla damned time, didn't seem to care what others thought. Even the officers seemed to have no self-respect. And that sunny American countenance was, to the Vietnamese, also insulting. If you weren't a fool or an idiot, then you were treating *them* with disrespect by acting like a fool right in front of them.

I'm making it more of a problem than it was. We weren't social robots. We all knew that there were different people in different lands with different customs. Nobody was a fool or an idiot here. No one was being insulted. We were doing the best we could. We were a tight little fire-clearing machine.

The *Trung Úy* was old-school. His French was excellent - English, not so much. Language skills are almost archeological - you can tell how old somebody is by his acquired language skills. The *Trung Úy* was old enough to be out of his element. You have to notice and respect that. My French was laughable - he almost laughed a couple of times. I could see it in his eyes - I took it as a compliment. I just grinned at him like an idiot. We got along. Had to. We were in that bunker on 12 hour shifts.

**Jersey Shore**

In late 1968, the USS New Jersey showed up right offshore from the DMZ. The NJ was an Iowa-class battleship, the last of the WWII vintage still in service. It took up the job of cleaning out all the North Vietnamese artillery positions north of the DMZ. Lovely beast. I had posted a picture of it lifted from *Stars & Stripes* under the glass on one of our desktops. Both Vietnamese lieutenants gave it a look, but weren't that impressed.

Something came up late one afternoon. The Marine Amphibs on the *Của Việt* to our east had a fire mission plotted about 800 meters away from one of our infantry patrols. Normally, I'd clear that easy peasy, but they wanted to use the New Jersey. I called the *Trung Úy* up to the map. ""*Hải pháo* (navy guns), shoot here."" He squinted at the map, got out a little ruler, looked at me like WTF, and said, ""Yah. Shoot.""

I wasn't sure he understood me. I said, ""*Hải pháo*"" again. ""Yah yah, *shoot*!"" he said. I picked up a paper and pen, wrote ""406 mm,"" on the paper and said ""*Hải pháo*,"" again. He parsed it out. ""Four. Zero. Six. Millimetre?"" I nodded. His eyes got wide. ""NO shoot!""

No shit, no shoot. I called off the dogs. The Amphibs weren't in contact or anything. Call me back with a smaller caliber. That ship has 5"" guns, too.

The *Thiếu Úy* had watched the whole thing. He looked at me, made his eyes wide, and said ""NO shoot!"" The *Trung Úy* put his hand over his mouth and made a snurking noise trying to stifle a laugh. Which set off me and the *Thiếu Úy*.  The *Trung Úy* kept his hand over his mouth, but he was laughing until he had tears in his eyes. Clearly, he wasn't used to doing that. But it was a good thing, anyway. Good for the team. We'll make our own face, thankyouverymuch.

**Speaking American**

We did, too. Wasn't as much fun as I thought. Shortly thereafter, there was planning for a big operation. The *Đại Tá* (Colonel) commanding the regiment was on his way to being a general officer in charge of the 3rd ARVN Infantry Division, which is what our regiment was being beefed up to become. The *Đại Tá* had mastered colloquial American English. His American-face was perfect.

We were invited to a meeting of all the ARVN, Marine and Army officers who were going to be part of this multi-national operation to sweep some part of the DMZ. The *Đại Tá* was in charge, and he was introducing people all around, laughing and smiling and cracking jokes.

He came to us: ""This is our artillery liaison unit."" He called us by name. Then he said something like, ""They will check all artillery fires to make sure we don't end up shooting at each other."" He made an alarmed face. Big laugh. ""So if you need artillery clearance, these are the men you should call."" He added more detail about that. Then he said, ""But if you have any questions about anything else, don't call them. They are only Lieutenants."" Another big laugh. I smiled. ""Call our \[Vietnamese words for Operations - S3- TOC\].""

**Dishonor**

When we got back to our bunker, the *Trung Úy* disappeared. Then he came back and called the *Thiếu Úy* out of the bunker. Then they both came back, and the *Thiếu Úy* said. ""*Trung Úy* would like you to repeat what the *Đại Tá* said when he pointed to us. He talked too fast in English to understand.""

Well fuck. He had said we ""were only Lieutenants."" He had made the Americans laugh at us. And they did, they laughed at us. And suddenly I looked down from the bridge of friendship and stolen laughter that connected us, and saw a chasm, thousands of years deep. Shit.

""He was joking with the Americans, "" I said, ""He didn't mean disrespect. Americans are like that."" The *Thiếu Úy* translated - the *Trung Úy* was in no mood to try to use his English, but he heard that. ""Disrespect. Dishonor,"" he said. Then he left the room. ""He is going to see the *Đại Tá*, "" said the *Thiếu Úy*. He was in tears. I felt like throwing up. Crap. This was NOT going to turn out well.

We should've had more faith in the *Đại Tá*. The guy was a good commander, but he was a better politician. He was set to be the new commanding general of a new division, and he was going to need senior officers of some experience. And his officers needed to be loyal. To him. He didn't miss the opportunity.

After a couple of hours, the *Trung Úy* came back to our bunker. I knew this because the *Thiếu Úy* jumped up and saluted as he yelled ""*Đại Úy*! (Captain!), Wut? I turned around, then did the same thing. There was the no-longer-*Trung Úy* standing there with Captain's insignia. He looked grim-faced as he returned our salutes. The *Thiếu Úy* was trying to keep a straight face, but y'know, I was an American.

I was grinning like a fuckin' idiot.

**Addendum**

You gotta love happy endings, but this story doesn't have one. The 3rd ARVN Division came into being, and held the same AO on Highway 1, just south of the DMZ until Spring of 1972. They disintegrated in the face of the massive NVA offensive across the DMZ and down to Quang Tri. Don't know what happened to my friends. Don't have too much to say about it, but that fact seasons this story for me."

Valerie Cimarossa, UAT’s Vice President of Marketing and Technology, feels that the partnership is a perfect fit for UAT’s tech-centric curriculum. “We are always looking for every opportunity to show young people that an education and a career in technology is a viable (and an awesome) choice.”

Last November, BGCS opened the [Ellie & Michael Ziegler STEAM Makerspace Studio](https://bgcs.org/news/ellie-michael-ziegler-steam-makerspace-studio-opens-in-boys-girls-clubs-of-greater-scottsdale-virginia-g-piper-branch/) inside the Virginia G. Piper clubhouse. At this Makerspace, Club members have access to specialized STEAM programming beyond the K-12 education system. “When BGCS first invited us to join their Makerspace Committee,” Cimarossa said, “we knew the natural next step was to provide an opportunity for these students to begin exploring a career in the technology BGCS had exposed them to.”

That step is the new UAT scholarship.  

We spoke to Dr. Donna Jagielski, Director of STEAM Makerspace Programs for BGCS, about how they are utilizing tech in their clubs and how students can participate.

**What is the importance of STEAM education in your clubs?**

*At Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale we are committed to inspiring youth and teens in STEAM-related fields to prepare them for Arizona careers of today and tomorrow.*

*In our Clubs,* [*STEAM*](https://www.uattech.com/programming-a-social-robot-to-help-around-campus) *is all about making a positive impact and being a changemaker through innovation. You have to be willing to rock the boat sometimes if you want to make a difference. Change is not always comfortable, but it is a necessary ingredient to move forward.*

*Our STEAM and Makerspace programming provides the development of that mindset through our organized programming, meeting youth/teens where they are and providing them with and teaching them to use cutting-edge technologies as their tools to make it happen.*

**What does the STEAM and Makerspace Program entail?**

*Our STEAM and* [*Makerspace*](https://www.uattech.com/trend-setting-students-and-next-gen-robotics) *programming introduces youth and teens to a balance of organized programming and opportunities for open/free exploration of their individual interests and the freedom to seek answers to their own questions using cutting-edge tools.*

*Our Club members are encouraged to take risks in voicing ideas and “failing forward,” cultivating self-efficacy and thus empowering our youth and teens with the knowledge that they CAN be changemakers.*

*It was important to me when designing our programming that the environment was one that is safe and supportive for our members to explore their interests with our guidance, yet without the influence of our own ideas.*

**How can students participate in the STEAM Makerspace Studio?**

*All of our Club members (K-12th grade) have access to our Studios and STEAM Makerspace programming, allowing them to participate in organized programming and to develop their own* [*projects*](https://www.uattech.com/tech-talent-for-rent) *as they pursue their own interests.*

*This past February, teens from our Virginia G. Piper Branch participated in the University of Arizona Connect2STEM and SciTech Festival with their own livestream event from our Makerspace Studio. These teens highlighted innovation with drones to design, test and complete a successful delivery mechanism.*

*We are planning for a variety of engaging opportunities for our members to be challenged and inspired.*

**How do you encourage students to pursue STEAM professions?**

*Our programming facilitates the development of a “maker mindset” and global thinking to help our members become agile and nimble with the understanding that most likely the job they will find themselves in has not yet been created. We encourage respect and collaboration, and at the same time help members develop a hard shell for criticism. Additionally, we focus on:*

* *Developing and striking a balance between both right and left sides of the brain*
* *STEM/STEAM mirrors real life and we help members identify that it is interwoven in everyday life and activities*

**How has UAT’s contributions to the development of your maker spaces been helpful?**

*From the inception of our STEAM Makerspace project, UAT has been by our side every step of the way, providing guidance and access to* [*resources*](https://www.uattech.com/uats-contributions-to-the-local-stem-ecosystem) *to ensure that we are indeed providing our members with world-class STEAM opportunities. UAT has also provided us with desktop computers that we use as part of our VR area.*

*And now, we are blown away with this new opportunity for our members to receive scholarships for tuition to UAT.*

**What does a UAT scholarship mean for your students?**

*Through this partnership, our Club members will be able to continue following their passions for STEAM learning as they continue on into post-secondary learning. UAT’s innovative degree programs will provide our members with cutting edge learning to prepare them to be our next STEM industry leaders.*

"From Dating to Girlfriend: How to Make That Special  Girl your GirlfriendThere I was, staring at the ceiling with a smile on my face trying to figure out how I ever lived my life without her. Emotions were running through my mind as the replay of our night together echoed in my mind. I knew that my social skills got me to this place but I was not sure how to make her my girlfriend. I knew that I wanted to go from dating to a committed relationship but how do you do that?  
The process of learning how to make a girl your girlfriend was a painful one for me and so I hope that through this article you save yourself the mistakes that I made. 


The first thing that you MUST understand about making a girl your girlfriend is that love never dies of starvation, but often of indigestion. When we find something we like we often hold on to it so tight that it dies in our hands. We see this principal played out all the time in our lives when we spend too much time with some we end up getting annoyed with them and find someone else to be around for awhile. Think of this principal another way…

**.. Familiarity breeds contempt. **

The last thing that you want to do is suffocate your potential girlfriend with too much of you. Space things out and relax. 

**Tip #1: Space out the time you see her. **

If you want her to be your girlfriend you have to allow her to space to miss you. I know that every fiber of your being is saying something different and your heart is yelling at you to call her and see her but you have to allow some space between you two or you will suffocate each other before you know it. This is why I often suggest that you see each other once or twice a week. If you are spending 5 days together you are going to breed contempt at a much quicker pace because you have not allowed the emotions to calm down a bit. 


**Tip #2: Stop trying to “game” her. **

I cannot emphasize enough how important this tip is. Guys who learn some social skills never shut off there “game” and they try to hold her attention with gifts, texts and anything they can do to look good.  You must stop treating her as something you want to “accomplish” and start being a human being around her. It’s ok to mess up, show affection, show emotions and loosen up a bit. 


**She isn’t a game guys, she’s a girl. **

If you continue to “game” her she is going to get the feeling she is getting played and walk at some point. Believe me when I say that I have screwed this up so many times. You have to have the ability to be vulnerable because opening up and sharing is where love is formed. 


**Tip #3: Get a life.**

If you drop your life to be with her she won’t respect you in the long run. Hopefully you had a life before her and you should have one while you are with her. Many times guys will ditch their friends and lives just to spend more time with their crush but all the while they are doing more harm than good. This goes back to a post I wrote on scarcity vs. abundance.(http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/exd7y/scarcity_vs_abundance_how_neediness_kills_your/) If you have no other social options in your life then your neediness will kill every positive gain that you get.  
You MUST man up and overcome your longing to spend every minute with her. Allow her to know what it’s like when you’re not there and give her space to clear her head. When you allow her space you are respecting her and this grows the connection between you two. 


**More Thoughts…**

The more you play the game the less likely you are to win. 
Ever sit down to play games at a casino? If you win but continue to play over time you are bound to lose. If this girl likes you and you continue to play the game then you are bound to lose. People want to feel connected to their partners. They don’t want to feel they are the object of some game but they want to feel like there is another person who connects with them and values them. Being a social robot is about shutting off all emotions that make us human and if you do this you will never keep the girl that you want. 

At the end of the day she doesn’t belong to you and you don’t belong to her. Only she makes the decision to be with you or not and only you can make that decision for yourself. If you shut yourself off and live in a world where you are going to try to “get” this girl then you are setting yourself up for failure. 

Give her space, allow her freedom to make decisions and continue having fun. Pretty soon she is going to open up and give you hints about being exclusive. I often say that a guy tends to decide when the relationship happens and the woman decides when sex happens. Be a man and allow her room to grow or you will destroy the very thing you want to create. 

All the best,

Mayson

"Dark night of the soul or Will to Live Abhiniveshic destruction gives way to Dharmadhatu Ex Ultima of the social robot Deus Ex Machina ( my friend Joe’s descent into dangerous hyper-intellectual schizophrenia reminiscent of John Nash’s case which he thinks are Alayc-Akashic-Dahrmakayc downloads ).   

    Part 1: A burnt left hand

      

    In my life, I have been haunted by what almost all members of the opposite sex would call extremely ugly ape features, autistic social idiocy, short stature, semi bald head, antisocial leanings, sexual shame at my own trannsexual sexual obsession to the exclusion of the other sexes, generalised anxiety brought on by acute psychic hypersensitivity.
    Until now women have bullied me, beaten me, insulted, betrayed and mentally molested me, poked fun at my troubles, abandoned me, used men as proxies, jabbed and gossiped behind my back, plotted with one of my coworkers to steal a lab position, condoned an organised mental and physical assault at my medical place of employment where I was driven to the point of physical and mental collapse by such extreme somatisations that actual steam came from my clothes from extreme adrenal dysfunction brought on by a continuous parade of workplace manipulation through the dark triad of deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.
    From what I gather, my external appearance renders me a useless bag of garbage, ineffectual social manipulator uninterested in climbing the social ladder and sacrificing years of his life pandering to illusory, pointless and immature female vanities, a punching bag of derision, mockery and scorn, a gigantic waste of time in regards to the main female principles of life, a constant drain on their mental resources, a subject of social stigma( gossip, gender misappropriation, sexual ostracisation, complete and utter ruination of my social reputation )brought on by my preferences for knowledge, wisdom, ascetic principles and everything regarding the mysteries of existence. In the end, I have achieved Will to Live destruction and finally accepted Thanatos, Yama, Anubis and Izanagi in my life. Abhiniveshic-Kaivalyan neurotechnologies based on sound life meta-philosophical principles stand as the only reason why I continue to stain the earth with my useless and ruinous disinterest in existence."
"I think of myself mostly as a social robotI kind of just think of myself as a biological robot programmed towards happiness and pleasure. Luckily a lot of the stuff that promotes happiness is pro-social. If you look up studies of positive psychology, you can see that the happiest people were those who pursue relationships, have a gratitude practice, and do good things for others. I think human beings are mostly biologically programmed to be good people, doing altruistic things tends to make us happier and win us the halo effect of other people thinking we're nice by doing good things.

Human beings ideally should get 6-7 hours of socialization a day, so isolating yourself will make you feel bad. In fact, isolation is perceived in the human brain as pain. So, if you want to feel better, you have to interact with other people. Having 5-6 close relationships was the healthiest for people, and those with close relationships were much more likely to stave off mental health issues. Students who did kind things for others were rated much more positively than their ruder peers, and generally high-status individuals cooperate more than low-status individuals.

So, basically, in summary, positive behavior was evolutionarily selected for, and you don't really have a choice but to pursue happiness. Happiness feels good, Sadness/Isolation/Hatred generally feels bad. So, we attempt to become happier people, therefore acting in specific ways. You can't be a happier person and go off being a hermit in the woods, except in specific circumstances like being a monk who has specifically trained their mind to be positive. ""Feeling good"" or ""feeling bad"" are really the final destination of most human action, the kind of thing that will condition us to act in certain ways, because they are so primally important.

So, humanity are basically friendly robots, who form strong relationships with one another because it feels good. You can try to rebel against this, I guess, but you'll just get pain as a reward.

I also often think about my own selfish inconsistencies. I am social, give to charity, try to be a good person, yet I gladly eat meat. I guess that's selfish, and then I have to kind of do backflips trying to justify my existence, as if I'm not just a carnivorous creature eating other animals. Which I am. And I have accepted that, but it doesn't make me feel good. I could probably stop eating meat, but I like it, it tastes good, and I can't be bothered.

Also, another selfish aspect of my existence is that I want to have sex and get a relationship. I don't feel like I am owed sex, the Universe doesn't care either way, but I really want it and am trying hard to get it. I've lost weight and am trying to get fitter and get a better job so I'm more likely to get an attractive girl who wants to have children with me. I guess if I were less selfish I would become a monk, not eat meat and not try to pursue selfish sexual pleasure. But I do these things regardless, I want them, in fact I want them very bad, I think about it often.

I would say one of my biggest motivators is finding a relationship. A lot of the changes I've made to myself have been with being attractive in mind: I lost weight, hit the gym, am working on my career, tried being more social. Why? In the back of my mind it was to find a hot girl. That's basically it. I think these things also give me value in other ways, but that was the primary goal. I'm not as out of breath when I exert myself, and being more social has made me happier. But sex/relationships was the big driving force behind my behavior.

I remember last year I was suicidal and I wondered what the point of life was, all of this effort and striving. I've mostly settled on life being about well-being and happiness, experiencing good emotions instead of negative ones. I guess I've settled on some kind of Epicureanism, hedonism being the highest good, except in a more total way, not just hookers and blow, but having strong relationships and feeling content. I don't think there is any deep significance to this view, I think it's just that evolution favored us this way, so you have to lean into it if you want to be happy. Being misanthropic and nihilistic will probably make you isolated and angry which may eventually lead to depression and suicide. So, if you are alive anyway, you ought to be happy. Then again, if you committed suicide it probably wouldn't matter to you subjectively, you'd be dead and then not experience anything anymore.

And even if I'm robotic, that doesn't mean I'm not creative and outgoing and interesting and all that. I just think there are basic deterministic processes to existing as a human being that can basically be simplified to ""social=good"". And you wonder why people have small talk? Just apply this principle to all of human life and you will see it's utility.

So, what am I going to do from here? Well, I have no choice. Keep texting my family and making friends and hanging out at band practice and talking with folks online. There's no other option, being social is my future, it's never going to go away. And that's going to be your future as well, we are chained to being social, you might as well accept it.

I kind of want to scream and cry over this revelation that we are chained to positivity, but I've mostly accepted it. It explains so much about how people operate, why people laugh and sing and make small talk and joke. We are slaves to being happy. Is there not something kind of horrifying about that? No wonder I was a cynical kid who listened to Radiohead. I thought my sadness made me unique. Of course, I couldn't stay there forever, and the isolation was crippling. But it was better to be a cripple than a robot, that was my view. Well, I was a robot then as well, just a less happy one. "
"A Guide for Industrial Designers Exploring Robotics! Q/AQuestion from u/ankittkd 

"""""" 

Hey, I just saw your post about '[Maths for building Humanoid Robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13wetk4/mastering_maths_8_essential_concepts_for_building/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).' Thank you for sharing that valuable information! I'm really interested in robotics and would love to learn more.  I recently graduated with a degree in Industrial design, and I'm eager to delve into the field of robotics. Based on my background, I've identified two domains that align well with my interests: human-robot interaction and hardware design.  While I've come across numerous online resources related to software, electronics, and AI in robotics, I've struggled to find comprehensive materials on designing hardware and the physical aspects of robotics. Could you please guide me towards resources or provide any advice on how I can learn about hardware design and the physical design aspect of robotics? And is there any field or part of robotics which is for people with creative arts/ design background Sorry for bombarding you with such long paragraphs. Thank you in advance!

""""

**My Take :** 

I think your background in Industrial Design can provide a unique perspective in the field. In particular, the domains you've identified - human-robot interaction and hardware design - are indeed excellent choices.

here are some of the resources I referred to through the university and my personal interest in the hardware design and physical aspects of robotics: **(Don't just stick to these resources.) There is always new paper published in the following areas so I would recommend keeping up with them.** 

* **Books**:
   * ""Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control"" by John J. Craig provides a solid foundation in the mechanics of robotics.
   * ""Robot Builder's Bonanza"" by Gordon McComb is more of a hands-on guide and covers a wide variety of topics including materials, power supplies, motors, and sensors.
* **Online Courses**:
   * edX has a course titled ""Robotics: Kinematics and Mathematical Foundations"" offered by the University of Pennsylvania.
   * Coursera offers ""Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control"" by Northwestern University. This is a six-course specialization covering spatial motion, robot dynamics, motion planning and control.

Regarding the aspect of human-robot interaction, a lot of it is about designing robots that are efficient and friendly to interact with, which requires an understanding of both design and psychology. Here, your Industrial Design background will be pretty beneficial. You might find these resources helpful:

* **Books**:
   * ""Human-Robot Interaction: An Introduction"" by Christoph Bartneck and Tony Belpaeme.
   * ""Social Robotics: A Guide to Human Interaction with Intelligent Machines"" by Kerstin Dautenhahn.
* **Online Courses**:
   * ""Human-Robot Interaction"" course offered by TUM on edX.
   * ""The Social Robot"" course offered by the University of Twente on FutureLearn.

Finally, regarding the use of creative arts/design in robotics. I live in Bristol, England and We have a company called Rusty Sqid here. They are amazing. chek them out -  [http://rustysquid.org.uk](http://rustysquid.org.uk) 

There is a lot of scope for creative arts/design in robotics also! Here are a few fields where your skills could be particularly valuable:

1. **Robot Design**: This includes designing how a robot looks and feels, and ensuring that it's user-friendly. This could be in any number of contexts - from designing a robotic toy that's appealing to children, to designing a household robot that fits seamlessly with a home's decor.
2. **Animation and Motion Design**: Animating robots (particularly humanoid robots) often use principles from the world of animation and character design. (I actually chose this as an elective during my university and it was super fun and you can learn a lot about kinematics )
3. **User Experience (UX) for Robotics**: This is about creating a smooth and intuitive interaction between humans and robots, and it often requires design thinking.

I hope these pointers will help. If you need more help just post your questions in the comments."
"Building Ethical Robots for the Public Sector – Can we take human behavior as the starting point?Increasingly, we can observe that autonomous robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used in public services. 

These high levels of automation can improve quality and efficiency of public processes substantially. In contrast, these autonomous robots and AI need to operate in such way that their actions and decisions meet our ethical expectations. This is in particular relevant for public services, as principles like transparency, fair and equal treatment of all citizens, accountability, and benevolence for citizens are cornerstones of well-functioning public administrations in democratic societies.

While it is obvious that we need ethical robots and AI in public services, it is less obvious to determine how we can assure that autonomous systems reliably meet these ethical expectations. 

In recent years, scientific literature has increasingly focused on this challenge. However, the vast majority of this literature builds on the inherent assumption that ethical standards for human behavior are a good reference framework to set ethical standards for autonomous systems. Nevertheless, robots and AI have substantially different strengths and weaknesses, compared to human decision making.

Against this background, we tested the equivalence hypothesis, which states that people have the same ethical expectations for autonomous robots as for humans.

In five different experiments, the evidence speaks mainly in favor of this **ethical equivalence hypothesis**. This means that – in most cases – respondents do not evaluate robot behavior as more (or less) unethical, compared to when the same behavior would be from humans. However, we do find some differences for specific cases.

Hence, for scientists as well as for practitioners, we recommend (1) that ethical standards for humans are a good starting point to develop standards for autonomous systems, but (2) that a case-by-case approach is needed to evaluate whether this strategy can indeed be applied to many different applications of AI and autonomous robots in the public sector.

"Determinism; Factored.""What is determinism?

""Determinism is a metaphysical philosophical position stating that for everything that happens there are conditions such that, given those conditions, nothing else could happen."" Source Wikipedia

Iterate all of those conditions, the causes and effects, the actual human reality; Whats causing stuff to happen to us that programs us?

1. Parental Conditioning
2. Non Parental Infant Conditioning
3. Toddler Conditioning
4. Child Social Conditioning
5. ""School"" Social Conditioning
6. ""Church"" Social Conditioning
7. Tribal and Hival feedback

8. Human Instincts
a. The needs pyramid
b. the navigational impulse instincts
c. Flight or Fight instincts
d. Emotional Coding in the Brain.
E Communication from the subconscious Mind
F. The Ego- Id Mirror
G. The Ego- Id Conflict
H. Brain Anatomy
I. Quantum Field Effects
J. The brain as a socially programmed computer
K. Taking the helm of genuine self programming
L. Identifying control mechanisms on your system and removing them- 




---------------

---------------

----------------

So the purpose of this thread is to list all the causes and effects that govern our lives and create some strong structures by which we can pin down how determinism holds us and thus what the shape of the deterministic cage is in order to then plot our escape path into free will.

Any serious discussion of determinism acknowledges that each individual is strongly programmed and conditioned and that the only way out of that progamming and conditioning is becoming self aware of the control mechanisms and control vectors and programming process and the intrapersonal vulnerabilities and etc that makes it all possible. Its a Self hypnosis problem in 4 stages; beta brainwave stage consisting of the verbal and scientific information required to make an ACCURATE MAP of REALITY relative to the issue of programming and cultural and social influences.

Only once you have a VERY accurate model of those things can you begin to see how to move in a manner not dictated by those forces.

So if you WANT free will; which you almost certainly do not actually have right now- You have to learn how the universe operates and how society and mental programming operates and then how you can self operate as a self programmer instead of as a hival drone bot.

Thats the harsh reality of determinism. Right now you are a conditioned genetic /social robot. BUT... The SOFT side of determinism is NOT that free will does not exist- IT IS INSTEAD that free will is AN EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL which is within your grasp to attain.

NOW. How do you get yourself some o that free will? Work it. Sincerely. Together as a team. Process it with me and I will open your doors for you.

Factor each element; factor the assorted influences and how they operate and then factor whats going on inside of your brain.

Consider the psychology of it, the sociology of it, the game dynamics of it, the systems theory of it... the political science implications of it... Realize that nobody has free will not even the elites who are TIED DOWN AND INTO their role as vampire caste warfare propaganda warriors.

The inverse control principle strings them up into a noose. They can't control the proles without over controlling themselves and they end up getting the worst of it tho they aren't in a perspective to see it.

So they don't have free will either.

Reset the system socially- To develop and nurture free will instead of slave caste orwellian fascism... might be a fine idea... once we get this going ya know.. to repair your civilization before it crashes and burns because all anyone can do is babble insanely any more not work in the real world with science on problems

--------------

----------------

Edit

------------

it did not ""forsee"" you writing this post existing somewhere in the many worlds tree of possible things you might probably do in at least some many worlds iterations of you.

You writing this post was one of an infinitude of things you might do inside of the box of determinism.

It doesn't work like you suggest it does. Determinism does not say; Person X is predestined. It says persons X conditioning will put them on a conditioned path that is like a rail road. so now its up to you to get off the tracks.

All kinds of adventures could happen along those tracks, and they are hyperlocated tracks with many possible many worlds variations- this is key to understand. Determinism does not select which possible world you manifest it only limits your selection of probable and possible worlds. Until you step off the track, the deepest scope of your pseudo free will is to make choices between significant probable universes. Not very highly improbable ones.

Determinisms track for your life is infinitely forked ten times a second. But you don't get to experience that forking you only get to experience one straight line subjective path.

Free will isn't choosing which fork to be on. Its getting off the tracks.

---------------------------

----------------------

------------------

Quantum rules apply or ddon't apply? first problem; there is no such thing as a perfect copy. Second problem; any splitting would happen along some kind of polarization field. Third problem, fully half of whats going on in the neural net is completely random. fourth problem whats not random is still governed by strong dice rolls, for instance which brodmanns brain areas are most active and how much, or the specific skin temps of the persons involved- immediately will not match- because theres enough randomness in the system to inherently skew their behaviors away from each other.

Both persons are operating in a deterministic universe, but cause and effect never renders the exact same ending conditions from the exact same starting conditions. not even in systems machined identical. We could reduce your thought experiment down to tea cups. Two tea cups in a cabinet. Perfectly identical and then add time. How long until they break symmetry? Its only a matter of time.

Days, weeks, months ..years.. sooner or later one of them breaks or distorts or stains first.

Ya I wondered this myself. Though I don't see how we can prove somethings ""random"" just because we can't predict it or find a pattern, I feel like of the two objects were identical truly even sub atomically they'd behave the same, though there's no way to prove this.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply

[–]Panprometheus 1 point 3 hours ago 

in QM, its beyond redundantly proved that events are based on randomness. The only question is how random is a given system. the human system turns out to be highly random. Thus two exact copies of one person would only behave ""identically"" for the few seconds that it takes for the randomness to overtake the determinancy.

This is not a matter of conjecture, its hard science. Randomness does not negate a deterministic universe- far from it- it creates branches and forks of deterministic possibility- both or all forks on any given fork tree or tree fork are still almost entirely deterministic, but that does not mean that two copies of one person would literally continue to behave over time as identical mirror units. They won't. Neither will two electrons, or two photons, or two animals... or etc any real world test of this easily proves that randomness is a core and central aspect to the reality we live in.

This is not conjecture, its science fact. Those interested in determinism or free will should get up to date on how the deterministic universe actually operates instead of project determinism as a philosophy at physics and thus end laughably dead wrong.

"I'm writing a ""Guide to Getting Your Shit Together"" for my little brothers and some friends and need to know what should I add/remove?I've got three little brothers (one of which is about to go to college!) that are 8-12 years younger than me.  I've been away from home for almost a decade, for various reasons, and I really like to write some advice for them about how to be successful for people that didn't excel in school, don't have high profile jobs, and the like.  I want to write something that will really help them be successful pursuing their own unique interests -- but I don't want to tell them ""just do what I did"".  My end goal is probably a website I can point them too, but for now I just want to nail the ""Success Process.""

&nbsp;
  
So any feedback on the topic would be great.

    
&nbsp;

If I had to guess, I'd say there are 4 ""phases"" to success, just from everything I've read. 

&nbsp;

**First Phase:  It's All About You**

&nbsp;

1. Personal Responsibility: BYOB

&nbsp;

**Second Phase:  Setting the Stage**

&nbsp;

2. Big Wins:  Principles Are More Important Than Details
3. Process:  Process Is Repeatable, Product Is Unpredictable
4. Habits:  People Are Social Robots and So Are You
5. Goals:  Any Loser Can Set Goals

&nbsp;

**Third Phase:  Tightening Up**

&nbsp;

6. Consistency:  Just Shut up and Show Up
7. Preparation:  Front Loading the Work
8. Environment:  It's Yours to Terra Form

**Last Phase:  Making Your Success Real**

&nbsp;

9. Courage:  Create your own Success
10. Confidence:  Making the Leap

&nbsp;

If you had to give your little brothers advice on how to be successful -- without building up a bunch of college debt or working at a job they hate -- what would you tell them?"

New brain implant could translate paralyzed people's thoughts into speech by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

I prophesy in twenty years, maybe less, that all diagnostic imaging machines, in fact any machine that collects data about something, will have intrinsic narrow AI to interpret the data collected.

In other words the x-ray machine itself, will read the x-rays on the spot.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

[–]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

1 point 1 month ago 




Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

This guy.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

"The pre-singularity period is exciting in its own way | Much like our ancestors and great-grandfathers, we live in an epoch of two worlds that compete and coexistI'm a strange man for strange reasons. There's nothing more fascinating to me than the image of sitting outside on a cool evening drinking ice-water, watching stars sprinkle onto the Belt of Venus, listening to cicadas right alongside a companion robot. A social robot like Pepper could fill that niche for me. 

Yet when I tell people about this, many find it comical, if not jarring. [Robots like Pepper look a tad creepy](http://i.imgur.com/Ks55jK3.gifv). They seem out of place. Though their abilities are limited, Pepper still seems like something from the future because humans still have a natural psychological propensity to imbue intelligence into things that resemble us or act intelligently. It's an artificially intelligence humanoid robot! And because of science fiction, we tend to place these things mostly inside high-tech laboratories, on the streets of a megacity, and maybe slaving on a farm. It's almost a waste to think of sending one of these things out into the boonies just so some random Redditor can spend time with it listening to bugs calling for mates.

Yet that jarring sense that I'm using tomorrow's toys for yesterday's joys is nothing new. People experienced the same fascinating clash throughout the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. This was the root of the Romanticist literary and art movements. The contrasting worlds set the mood for the Edwardian Age, the Belle Epoque, and the Interwar period. It was the inability to recognize that old traditions no longer functioned in the modern world that led to the savagery of the First World War.

World Wars 1 and 2 are extremely fascinating to me because this period was the peak of the pre-digital industrial world. You saw advancements in science, in engineering, in the human condition itself as things our ancestors took for granted fell before our casual experimentation with electromagnetism, nuclear engineering, genetics, and so much more.

I actually have a whole ""Saved"" section full of geriatric Redditors talking about life in the past and historians laying out how change came so rapidly that it would make modern Singularitarians blush. How it was a world of seeming contradictions:

How most of the world lived in extreme poverty under kingdoms or their equivalents (imperial autocracies, sultanates, khanates, princely states, etc.) and the idea that there was some segment of society that ruled because God willed it was treated as a natural norm. How the average person plowed without machinery on little plots of land. How women were actively discouraged from gaining an education or finding jobs outside of wartime. How even in the '50s it was common in the US South to see horse-drawn carriages in small-town streets, to read old literature by candlelight, to only eat food grown by your family or someone your family knows, to create utensils out of spare metal parts and recycle them endlessly because you didn't have any culture of disposability, to give birth in the homestead because it was not common for hospitals to have such wards.

A time when some people had never seen artificial light (that is, not from the sun or by fire). Yet also a time when mankind learned how to set sail in the skies, ride in motorized carriages (nowadays shortened to 'cars'), *even discover that something as simple as washing your hands kept surgery patients alive.*

When the world was industrialized but there were still pockets where civilization had not meaningfully changed since the Renaissance or even before, when there were still nomadic tribes living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged since before the Sumerians while urban hipsters played with cameras and mechanical gadgets. 

When peasants were still a large class in the world and were so removed from whatever was going on in life that they had no reason to believe the 21st century would be any different from the 19th, all the while the Victorian Internet arose across the West to allow for instant communication among different nations.

When archers and swordsmen were still highly valued parts of Western and Eastern militaries alongside machine gunners and air forces (I believe the last cavalry charge took place in World War II?). 

When racism was a beast clashing between those who cared about national ethnicity more like the Athenians and Han vs. those who saw like-skin color as the only requirement (ironically a more 'progressive' form of racism only possible in modern times). When conception of a child was still seen as a miracle rather than an understood scientific process, but psychology was in its infancy as we realized how the brain affected behavior rather than myths of humors and astrological mysticism. 

When rockets broke out of the Earth's atmosphere and rural folk rode to their relatives on horseback to hear about it. 

When nostalgic scenes of young boys and girls catching frogs in streams coexisted with futurists marveling at wirelessly driven cars and televisions gaining color.

That era, from the 1890s to the 1950s, was the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, when industrialism bore most of its fruit. For the most part, that era of contradictions has passed as the fruits of the Industrial Revolution spread to all corners of the planet (though in unequal amounts). Nowadays, even hunter-gatherer tribes use modern technology and wear modern clothing and retain their lifestyle mostly out of tradition; anomalies like the Sentinelese are just that. It's so rare to see people riding on horseback as their primary means of transportation that it can reach the top of /r/TodayILearned just to learn about it and they tend to be compared to the Amish.

And that's the truth of it. What was once pockets of the old ways coexisting with modernity shrunk to literal motes of quaintness and tradition. These won't go away, but they will be joined by what we call modernity soon enough.

You see, the Digital Revolution is a fundamentally different event entirely, one we're still trying to recognize in full. Industrialism was when we began supplanting human muscle and automating machinery with analog clockwork. 

Digitalism, on the other hand, began the rise of cognitive automation. It is my firm belief that, if we never invented digital computing or mass produced Turing-complete machines, societal evolution would have stagnated sometime around 1960-1970. As great as our machines were and as much progress in the sciences as we made, it was all low-hanging fruit that we could reach.

There are more fruits hanging above and we cannot reach them without digital technology. They require skills only a handful of savants and polymaths could ever realize, and there are many more skills no human or biological lifeform can ever learn or utilize. Fruits we still managed to reach because of the Digital Revolution. 

It's been nearly a century since the start of the Digital Revolution, but we've already entered the maturation period. 

And because of this, we're beginning to see familiar contradictions arise. You can see it argued on /r/Futurology all the time, reports coming out endlessly that jobs will be sacrificed to the machines. And the familiar refrain is ""But the robots will create more jobs in response!"" The horses analogy popularized by CGP Grey is fine by itself, but I am more reminded by how established-industrialists and traditionalists a century ago said ""X is a passing fad"". It wasn't just cars. There were predictions that electric lamps, television, radio, *even nuclear physics* were just fads. 

And if you want to go old-school, people in centuries prior claimed that industrial machines themselves were a cute novelty but ""we had more than enough manpower""; printed books were neat but ""oral storytelling will regain its place soon enough""; guns were an unusual and egalitarian development but ""they pale in comparison to a fine archer"" (something I touched upon earlier, how there were military officials as late as the Franco-Prussian War who hoped that archers would re-replace riflemen due to the inaccuracy of guns of the day). 

Today, its honestly no different when people look at the latest in robotics, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms and say ""It looks cool, but there'll always be jobs for people"". We don't recognize that it's the limitations of modern technology that allow us to be so confident in oru doubts until we are old and reflecting on how we ever believed anything but the new normal.


I sincerely believe that, over the next two to three decades, more coexisting contradictions will come about. Things such as using smartphones and physical computers while cyberkinetic wireless connections to the internet exist; writing books and making music and drawing cartoons when it's possible to [synthesize art](/r/MediaSynthesis); visit physical stores when drones can deliver to you directly and fabricators/3D printers can allow you to download whatever you need; create multimedia experiences for emotional impact when direct brain-to-brain emotional communication is possible; work at your uncle's little restaurant while fully-automated mines are established on other planets to pre-empt human exploration; visiting concerts of your favorite band while others use virtual reality to see concerts of bands that have long since split and passed on, or even bands and musical scenes that never existed until the computer synthesized it a few hours ago; spraying distilled chemicals to freshen the air in your room when neural stimulation can let you re-experience any sensation; playing with cats and dogs while we resurrect long-extinct species like mammoths and perhaps even our sisters like the Neanderthals or genetically modifying any animal directly to make it domesicated and docile no matter how reptilian and hostile it may be in the wild; and, going back to my original tale, sitting outside in a plastic chair enjoying an evening alongside a robotic companion. 

The internet was the first big, juicy fruit of the Digital Revolution that impacted your life. It was and remains proto-telepathy, the planet becoming aware of itself. It is now developing into an actual space of political and social development and has to be taken seriously by those who once cast it aside as a distraction. And to be fair, it *was* once a distraction. Technology has not yet augmented us; it distracts us. Human enhancement still lies ahead, but it's very close and the Internet is something of a test-run to see how we can handle constant exposure to others. 

We no longer live in a world where history is mostly written through the posh dialects of aristocrats and clerics with society left to be viewed through their eyes and minds; we now see that the world is full of meaty, greasy, hypersexual, xenophobic, childish, and yet still empathic and intelligent apes and always has been. Right now, we still mostly look at the ""Old Days"" and see people of culture and civility, not realizing that they were just as crass as we are but 99% of people were illiterate and the 1% who weren't wrote only what they thought was important to know. The Internet equalized all of that.

But it hasn't actually changed anything. If 4chan existed in the Roman empire, it wouldn't fundamentally be any different than how it is now. But we are on the cusp of an age of humans and non-humans who discuss things and share knowledge in ways many can't grasp. 

And in a manner, this makes modern society all that much more exciting to watch develop."
"The greatest anxiety eliminater there is…**TL;DR = Sincere belief that your approach makes logical sense will absolutely annihilate any form of approach anxiety there is.**

This is gonna be a long post… 

So without further ado, here’s what I have to say.

My background is as follows… I was the typical weird kid in high school. It’s not so much that I wasn’t good-looking enough or self-confident enough, it was a matter of straight up being strange. The first three years of high school was fine. I had friends and a decent social life. Now, what truly showcased my awkwardness or weirdness was in my last year when I finally decided to tackle matters of getting girls.

If you guys remember the description of the social robot by Style in The Game, I was that guy. I devoted my life to game at the expense of other passions. No more video games, no more weightlifting, no more academics. My sole purpose in life at that point was game.

I followed The Mystery Method to the bone marrow and allowed it to define all that I am. I practically not just absorbed the techniques, but also its atheistic ethos. Nothing wrong with atheism but Eric’s (Mystery’s) explanation of it was incredibly dorky. Really, that’s the best word for it. He overcomplicates shit that otherwise can be explained in plain English. But at that point in my life it was fucking gospel.

Being that I was a teen, all I had available was day game. So I did things at the mall. And the sad thing is, despite my over sixty approaches, the lingering ache of that shithole we call “approach-anxiety” never ever went away. NOTHING cured it. Fucking nothing. I had an NLP expert as a friend who was a close friend of Hypnotica himself of all people and his shit didn’t work… Well, to be fair it kinda did. But it was a mere bandaid. It was the kind of thing that would’ve “cured” my approach anxiety issues if I had the money to have him truly coach me. I was a high school student with no job.

Fast-forward 2015 CE. This was THE GOLDEN AGE of my social life. But despite that, it was also chaotic. In the arena that is my dating game, everything was sporadic. Sometimes I had zero approach anxiety, other times I felt scared. I couldn’t explain how it worked, nor did I know.

And finally, today… This very day… I found the answer.

I’m proud to admit that my knowledge of the stuff I intend to specialize in is decent. I have a good grasp of Napoleonic warfare history, ancient warfare history, and overall philosophy. And it is exactly that knowledge that helped me find the answer to virtually annihilating this thing we call approach anxiety. And it is this…

**If you honestly believe, deep down in your mind, in your very soul, that your “routine” is legit, you will never be scared. Ever. A great man once said the following… (Sun Tzu)**

*He whom the ancients called an expert in battle gained victory where victory was easily gained. Thus, the battle of the expert is never an exceptional victory, nor does it win him reputation for wisdom or credit for courage. His victories in battle are unerring. Unerring means that he acts where victory is certain and conquers an enemy that has already lost.*

Truer words were never spoken. So how does it apply to dating?

In the world of game, we all have to work the numbers. I particularly like Hypnotica’s advice of programming yourself to say “Next” immediately after you get “rejected”. It is the only way to move forward. However, **how you will feel in each and every one of these encounters has nothing to do with your emotional callouses, but everything to do with how you perceive your very own technique.** If you sincerely believe that this technique of yours has no real risks, you’ll feel at peace with it. Nothing will shake you. And it’s all a matter of common sense. It doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out whether or not directly saying “I wanna fuck your pussy” to a lady in the middle of her date is moronic at best. This shit is common sense.

So if you have an opener that is clean and safe, yet not lacking the necessary boldness to make things an adventure, **you will never have the curse of approach anxiety looming over you.**

Thanks for reading."
"Jibo SDK updateJust got this...

Dear Developer and Campaign Supporter,  

On Tuesday we sent you an email to update you with Jibo’s delivery information, and to confirm your interest in continuing to be part of the Jibo Early Access Program.  We set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Now, we’ve done it, and Jibo robots are ready for delivery to early access program participants.
Our goal from day one was to deliver Jibo and the tools developers would need to create amazing skills for Jibo.  What we have learned, as other hardware-based platforms have, is this is very hard to do.  There are many learnings as you bring the physical platform to market.  For us, one of those learnings has been a better way to architect skills for Jibo.  This has resulted in a shift in approach that takes full advantage of the cloud and substantially increases skill switching speed and memory efficiency.  As an owner of Jibo, we think you will appreciate these changes.  As a Jibo developer, we know you will.  
Unfortunately, these changes will delay our next public release of developer tools.  We have not finalized the date for the re-launch of our developer tools, but we will be sure to keep the community updated on this via our developer newsletter and blog. 

With this news, we hope you are still keenly interested in being apart of the Jibo Early Access Program.  We will work to get you the tools you need as quickly as we can.  Please know we appreciate the interest developers are showing in Jibo as a platform. The developer community remains a core part of our strategy to extend Jibo’s capabilities and role in people’s homes.

We hope this doesn’t change your interest in receiving Jibo into your home. 
 
We continue to look forward to what you bring to life on Jibo.
Sincerely,
Team Jibo"
"Determinism; Factored.""What is determinism?

""Determinism is a metaphysical philosophical position stating that for everything that happens there are conditions such that, given those conditions, nothing else could happen."" Source Wikipedia

Iterate all of those conditions, the causes and effects, the actual human reality; Whats causing stuff to happen to us that programs us?

1. Parental Conditioning
2. Non Parental Infant Conditioning
3. Toddler Conditioning
4. Child Social Conditioning
5. ""School"" Social Conditioning
6. ""Church"" Social Conditioning
7. Tribal and Hival feedback

8. Human Instincts
a. The needs pyramid
b. the navigational impulse instincts
c. Flight or Fight instincts
d. Emotional Coding in the Brain.
E Communication from the subconscious Mind
F. The Ego- Id Mirror
G. The Ego- Id Conflict
H. Brain Anatomy
I. Quantum Field Effects
J. The brain as a socially programmed computer
K. Taking the helm of genuine self programming
L. Identifying control mechanisms on your system and removing them- 




---------------

---------------

----------------

So the purpose of this thread is to list all the causes and effects that govern our lives and create some strong structures by which we can pin down how determinism holds us and thus what the shape of the deterministic cage is in order to then plot our escape path into free will.

Any serious discussion of determinism acknowledges that each individual is strongly programmed and conditioned and that the only way out of that progamming and conditioning is becoming self aware of the control mechanisms and control vectors and programming process and the intrapersonal vulnerabilities and etc that makes it all possible. Its a Self hypnosis problem in 4 stages; beta brainwave stage consisting of the verbal and scientific information required to make an ACCURATE MAP of REALITY relative to the issue of programming and cultural and social influences.

Only once you have a VERY accurate model of those things can you begin to see how to move in a manner not dictated by those forces.

So if you WANT free will; which you almost certainly do not actually have right now- You have to learn how the universe operates and how society and mental programming operates and then how you can self operate as a self programmer instead of as a hival drone bot.

Thats the harsh reality of determinism. Right now you are a conditioned genetic /social robot. BUT... The SOFT side of determinism is NOT that free will does not exist- IT IS INSTEAD that free will is AN EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL which is within your grasp to attain.

NOW. How do you get yourself some o that free will? Work it. Sincerely. Together as a team. Process it with me and I will open your doors for you.

Factor each element; factor the assorted influences and how they operate and then factor whats going on inside of your brain.

Consider the psychology of it, the sociology of it, the game dynamics of it, the systems theory of it... the political science implications of it... Realize that nobody has free will not even the elites who are TIED DOWN AND INTO their role as vampire caste warfare propaganda warriors.

The inverse control principle strings them up into a noose. They can't control the proles without over controlling themselves and they end up getting the worst of it tho they aren't in a perspective to see it.

So they don't have free will either.

Reset the system socially- To develop and nurture free will instead of slave caste orwellian fascism... might be a fine idea... once we get this going ya know.. to repair your civilization before it crashes and burns because all anyone can do is babble insanely any more not work in the real world with science on problems

--------------

----------------

Edit

------------

it did not ""forsee"" you writing this post existing somewhere in the many worlds tree of possible things you might probably do in at least some many worlds iterations of you.

You writing this post was one of an infinitude of things you might do inside of the box of determinism.

It doesn't work like you suggest it does. Determinism does not say; Person X is predestined. It says persons X conditioning will put them on a conditioned path that is like a rail road. so now its up to you to get off the tracks.

All kinds of adventures could happen along those tracks, and they are hyperlocated tracks with many possible many worlds variations- this is key to understand. Determinism does not select which possible world you manifest it only limits your selection of probable and possible worlds. Until you step off the track, the deepest scope of your pseudo free will is to make choices between significant probable universes. Not very highly improbable ones.

Determinisms track for your life is infinitely forked ten times a second. But you don't get to experience that forking you only get to experience one straight line subjective path.

Free will isn't choosing which fork to be on. Its getting off the tracks.

---------------------------

----------------------

------------------

Quantum rules apply or ddon't apply? first problem; there is no such thing as a perfect copy. Second problem; any splitting would happen along some kind of polarization field. Third problem, fully half of whats going on in the neural net is completely random. fourth problem whats not random is still governed by strong dice rolls, for instance which brodmanns brain areas are most active and how much, or the specific skin temps of the persons involved- immediately will not match- because theres enough randomness in the system to inherently skew their behaviors away from each other.

Both persons are operating in a deterministic universe, but cause and effect never renders the exact same ending conditions from the exact same starting conditions. not even in systems machined identical. We could reduce your thought experiment down to tea cups. Two tea cups in a cabinet. Perfectly identical and then add time. How long until they break symmetry? Its only a matter of time.

Days, weeks, months ..years.. sooner or later one of them breaks or distorts or stains first.

Ya I wondered this myself. Though I don't see how we can prove somethings ""random"" just because we can't predict it or find a pattern, I feel like of the two objects were identical truly even sub atomically they'd behave the same, though there's no way to prove this.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply

[–]Panprometheus 1 point 3 hours ago 

in QM, its beyond redundantly proved that events are based on randomness. The only question is how random is a given system. the human system turns out to be highly random. Thus two exact copies of one person would only behave ""identically"" for the few seconds that it takes for the randomness to overtake the determinancy.

This is not a matter of conjecture, its hard science. Randomness does not negate a deterministic universe- far from it- it creates branches and forks of deterministic possibility- both or all forks on any given fork tree or tree fork are still almost entirely deterministic, but that does not mean that two copies of one person would literally continue to behave over time as identical mirror units. They won't. Neither will two electrons, or two photons, or two animals... or etc any real world test of this easily proves that randomness is a core and central aspect to the reality we live in.

This is not conjecture, its science fact. Those interested in determinism or free will should get up to date on how the deterministic universe actually operates instead of project determinism as a philosophy at physics and thus end laughably dead wrong.

"Sex Robots and WestworldI am currently enrolled on a Posthumanism module as part of a Masters (MA) in Cultural and Critical Studies. The module covers a range of viewpoints on Posthumanism including Transhumanism and post-anthropocentric/interspecies, etc. This week's topic was 'Androids' and we had a set text to read which is a critical posthuman-feminist analysis of sex robots. Alongside this we were asked to watch the first episode of Westworld. I wrote up my thoughts and thought I would share them here as I don't have many people to discuss this topic with! The post contains a small spoiler for Westworld ep1-2. I posted [this article on Medium](https://jamrock.medium.com/thoughts-sex-robots-and-westworld-1049323a150) where I am tweaking it and updating the links. I have pasted below with minimal formatting for those who do not wish to leave Reddit :)

**Thoughts: Sex Robots and Westworld**

As part of our teaching on the Posthumanism module, there were two activities to complete ahead of this week’s lecture on ‘Androids’.

* Watch ‘The Original’ episode/pilot of Westworld (2016)
* Read Neda Atanasoski and Kalindi Vora, “Epilogue: On Technological Desire, Or Why There Is No Such Thing as a Feminist AI”, in Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures (London: Duke University Press, 2019, pp. 188–196)

I read the extract above before I watched the episode of Westworld. The reading really influenced the way I viewed Westworld through a posthumanism lens (and likely reason that our professor set us these tasks). This post is not intended as an academic review of either the article or Westworld but simply a way to quickly gather my thoughts before the lecture. Although the term robots is used in the article, I use the distinction provided by our professor that android is the correct term for a robot that has a humanlike appearance.

Atanasoski and Vora met as postdoctoral scholars who shared an office in the Anthropology Department at Berkeley in 2007. It became evident from their daily interactions that their interests were leading to a collaborative project on race, technology, and politics which led to the publication, in 2019, of their joint work Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures.

From the Westworld Wiki the following summary of the series is useful for the purpose of this post:

>The series is a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin. Set at the intersection of the near future and the re-imagined past, it explores a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.

The Westworld series features lifelike Androids that are programmed with scripts or narratives that they enact as ‘Hosts’ within an immense adventure park for ‘Guests’. The Guests can enjoy an immersive experience while choosing to indulge their boldest or darkest fantasies. This frequently involves the androids (Hosts) being brutally beaten or killed. The androids are also used for sex as passive encounters e.g. a ‘girlfriend experience’ as ‘brothel workers’ or as victims of sexual assault and rape.

The Atanasoski and Vora article discusses various type of ‘lifelike’ sex robots currently being developed and enhanced through advanced robotics, virtual reality and advanced programming of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI). An example of one company creating these androids is Realbotix and their RealDoll product. The creator (an artist and sculptor) of these androids, Matt McMullen, seeks to enhance his ‘silicon sculptures’ with AI to ‘create a genuine bond between man and machine’. Through a simple posthumanism lens there would be much to explore here but the authors introduce a strong postcolonial feminism reading, drawing on the work of black scholar, Hortense Spillers. The authors express clearly the question they are setting out to analyse:

>We argue that the design imaginaries behind **commercial sex robotics represent a technoliberal update to a racial history entangling the desire for “a carefully calibrated sentience” in an artificial person with a desire for property**. Hortense Spillers has asserted that slavery renders the body of the enslaved as flesh, as non-subject. **This desire we raise for analysis in this epilogue is for sex with animate objects that resemble human beings in ways that keep them nonautonomous, yet simulate pleasure, and therefore simulate consent.** We ask: What stands behind the technoliberal desire to engineer the simulation of reciprocity and pleasure into sex robots, and is it connected to the history of racial slavery and its postslavery aftermath at work within US racial liberalism?

I found it impossible to watch Westworld without having this question forefront in my mind when viewing the ways that Guests enacted violence on Hosts, especially given the time-period and location of Westworld in ‘the old West’. Atanasoski and Vora later draw further on Spiller

>The desire for something or someone that has been reduced to pure body, whether as a site of sexual desire or even as a companion, as in the example of Ishiguro’s robots, recollects Hortense Spillers’ observation that the history of US racial slavery permanently marked “various centers of human and social meaning,” specifically through her theorization of the political consequences of **the reduction to pure body of the captive African under US racial slavery. The technoliberal desire for the simulation of pleasure and reciprocity in sex robots is a desire for the simulation of consent from a site where subjectivity is structurally made to be impossible**

Spillers’ distinguishing of body and flesh is worth briefly expanding upon and here I am citing Vincent Lloyd’s article on Spillers:

>Spillers distinguishes between the body, ruled by cultural norms that include prescribed gender markings and performances, and the flesh, the unformed body, not even individuated. Turning African bodies into flesh, making them available to the slave market, involves physical violence. **As flesh, the enslaved are not seen as having personalities, are not seen as subjects of ethics**. They are interchangeable objects; if they differ it is in height and mass, like any other object — unlike a human. **As pieces of flesh, the enslaved are seen as incapable of relationships, incapable of kinship**. Taking the baby from the arms of its mother is thinkable if both are mere flesh.

This division of ‘body and flesh’ appears similar to Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben’s concept of bare life expressed through a distinction he described using the Ancient Greek terms zoē and bios. Bios described the form or manner in which life is lived while zoē is the reductionist biological act of simply being alive or existing. Agamben’s ‘bare life’ refers to when the biological fact of existing is given priority over the way a life is lived. An example of ‘bare life’ for Agamben was seen in the experiences of Auschwitz. I read this as synonymous with Spillers’ description of enslaved Africans reduced to a life of ‘flesh’.

The beating and sexual exploitation of the android Hosts in Westworld appears not to raise ethical concerns in the minds of the Guests as the androids are ‘not human’. The dehumanisation of the subject underpinned the racialised abuse, physical and sexual, of enslaved Africans which is one reason I found watching Westworld unsettling. The ‘human-ness’ or otherwise of androids is a topic that surfaces in Westworld and the in the development of sex robots. McMullen explains in a documentary the authors reference that he wants his SexDoll products to ‘appear clearly as dolls’ to avoid evoking ‘uncanny valley’ syndrome in customers. Uncanny valley describes “a hypothesis which holds that when features look and move almost but not exactly like human beings it causes a response of revulsion among some observers.” A quick Google search validated my understanding that this applies to androids as well as people who have undergone extreme cosmetic surgery.

>The uncanny valley is a term used to describe the relationship between the human-like appearance of a robotic object and the emotional response it evokes. In this phenomenon, **people feel a sense of unease or even revulsion in response to humanoid robots that are highly realistic**. \[…\] Casual observers also tend to describe **a vague eeriness when looking at an individual who looks radically different after cosmetic surgery.**

In *The Original* episode of Westworld there is a discussion between characters responsible for manufacturing the Hosts relating to a new characteristic that has been programmed to make the androids more lifelike. These ‘reveries’ allow Hosts to draw upon ‘previous experiences’. The enhancement is explained by their creator as introducing “the tiny things that make Hosts so real \[and\] make the guests fall in love with them”. Later in the episode, this development is questioned with one character complaining “He keeps making them more real, is that really what people want? \[…\] This place works because the guests know the Hosts aren’t real.” In the second episode a guest is confused by the appearance of a woman who welcomes him, asking “are you real?”. The response from the woman is “if you can’t tell, does it matter?”.

Returning to Atanasoski and Vora and the question of whether or not it matters, the authors ask the following question:

>Could the drive to develop sex robotics mark a translation and projection of a white supremacist destructive economy of desire into the indefinite and supposedly postrace future dreamed up and avowed by techno-liberalism?

The language used by the characters in Westworld supposes a not-too-distant future where the answer to their question is affirmatively answered. The staff of the park in Westworld joke in episode two about guests “raping and pillaging” and discuss decommissioning a female android because guests are losing interest in having sex with her. The dehumanisation of the androids, no matter that they appear lifelike and exhibit increasing signs of sentience, justifies their use as objects to be assaulted. To make a final concluding point I am going to slightly tweak the words of Spillers to describe the plight of Westworld’s android Hosts.

>As **machines**, the enslaved are not seen as having personalities, are not seen as subjects of ethics. As pieces of **machinery**, the enslaved are seen as incapable of relationships, incapable of kinship.

While this debate could be contested for anthropomorphising androids, the question is really about the dynamic and power structures that are encoded into the creation and commodification of “sex robots” for example what Shirley MacWilliam has described as ‘Turning Women into Dead Body Objects’. In other words much of the argument is not about the ethics of harming ‘objects’ but the ongoing concern with harm to women.

I uncovered many supporting resources which I will briefly list before the references supporting this post.

"3’s (or anyone), how do you cope with other people’s opinions and being genuine?I think it’s becoming a gnawing problem in my life that I overvalue other people’s opinions to the point where it feels like I don’t have morals myself, rather it’s determined by what would be the most socially acceptable. I’ve been growing my own morals, but I still feel controlled by other people’s standards and approval because I don’t feel like there’s much to me in terms of real affection since I’ve never grown up with them, so I’m kinda starting from scratch. My love thirst not to the point where I’m a social robot, but more like if I analyze lots of stuff that I do, it’s usually in service to an image of me that’s optimal, one that’s socially praised, popular, or just said to be a person you can care about and call a good guy. On the other hand, if I do disagree with society or anyone else’s opinions (given I don’t dislike them outright, which is most people), it feels like a personal confrontation to my values by a stronger force (other people and society, which I tend to lump together) and it makes me feel uneasy.

Examples:

Someone said they didn’t believe in true love, which hurt my feelings and image of idealized happiness. Really, if anyone bursts my confidence bubble that I use for achievement fuel, it hurts my feelings quite a bit.

I felt sick to my stomach when I looked at a list of signs of clinical narcissism and found I agreed with portions of it mainly because of the next example

I felt anxiety when I read articles saying narcissists don’t understand love and affection despite everything they do, mainly because I don’t know if example two was correct about whether I had the illness or not and if this example was right that I didn’t understand love

I immediately leaned on society by asking the incredibly mechanical question of what love was because I didn’t really know what its parameters were beside a state of being with certain characteristics including affection, self-sacrifice and understanding

———————————

So that’s my dilemma. I did just go on a long tangent about love and it would help to understand from other threes (or anyone) how they become genuine so they avoid this existential crisis, because I would like to have some peace of mind knowing that what I do is real and not seemingly a subliminally calculated maneuver to make people like me more. Am I doing the right thing? (I know there’s irony in that question, a lot of it, but society is how I see my way morally right now, like echolocation. But if I just knew if I was doing it right, I think I could have enough confidence to navigate on my own) Thanks, guys."
"The DIFFERENCE between Direct and Indirect Game and What They Are For? What about Hybrid Game?Because I see this discussion probably every other day in some form or another in this sub.. 

This argument is as old as this community (older than this Reddit seduction group) and the answer is simple (yeah right.). Read this in it's entirety. I know some of you are already dogmatic about how you feel but read this entire post and you may discover ideas people haven't discussed.

You're going to find a lot of guys especially these days telling you, ""just go direct bro and be genuine and be yourself."" And then you'll find that many those guys really aren't having that much success anyway, unless they are extremely good-looking and exactly what most girls consider their type. Maybe they approached hundreds of girls and every once in a while have some of modicum of success. But ""a blind hog gets an ear of corn every once in awhile"" as my father used to say.

The truth is, that going direct is only going to work consistently for probably 10% of guys.

For any given guy, it's only going to work sporadically.  It has a low percentage of success. But, it does work. It can work, in the right circumstances and under the right situations. But it's basically a numbers game, it's like playing the lottery. It's a complete crap shoot.

Indirect can work too but it takes a lot of training and honing the skills to get it right, and even so, girls still may not like you. so you can have the best routine and indirect opener or situational opener on Earth, but if the girl is just not interested in you, she pretty much is going to know what you want anyway, despite what are the experts tell you how you're sneaking up on her and trying to catch her off guard and make her want you. No, most girls know on some level exactly what you want when you're going up and talking to them so the indirect is just a way to **display your personality,** not a way to try and sneak in under the radar and trick her into chasing you.

Which one is better?

**The answer is, neither.**

It's not a linear game. **The best guys in this game learn to be dynamic individuals. Flexible. They flow.**

What's that shit Bruce Lee said? *""Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. **If nothing within you stays rigid**, outward things will disclose themselves.*

*Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash! Be water, my friend.""*

**Sometimes direct is better**, depending on the situation and the circumstances that you find yourself in. If I'm walking down the street, and I see a girl I like in a busy City, and I don't have time, and she doesn't have time, then it naturally makes sense for me to go direct. Let's get it going and see what happens! ""Haha, hell no.. I just saw you and if I didn't come say hi, and try and get to know you, I was going to kick myself in the ass for the rest of the day.""

**Plusses:** Grabbing your balls and putting yourself out there. That is good for learning a little bit about how to face that pressure of approaching and getting rejected and even once in a while getting success.

**Minuses:** You do get rejected more often than not, and, **you don't really learn a lot.** The only opportunity to learn from a direct approach is when the girl likes you, and you can take things further.  

Other times, if I'm walking through a Whole Foods, or a Trader Joe's, and I go up and I want to talk to a girl, it's not going to make any sense at all and it's going to come across **socially awkward, uncalibrated and weird or even creepy** if I go up and I'm super direct with a girl.

So in a situation like that, I may want a little bit more finesse based game. ""My mom wants me to eat more spinach, which one do you recommend?""

Again, I don't care what any of the gurus or experts tell you, she already knows what you want. There's the old Dave Chappelle joke that is actually more truthful than a joke and that is, just assume that if a guy is talking to you he's saying, ""want some dick?""

But, what going indirect is going to give you an opportunity to do is be more playful, learn, **and take the social pressure off of her by giving her Social Cover** Social Cover is taking the pressure off of her so that she can actually feel comfortable enough in specific situations, so that she can allow herself to get to know you. an example might be, how I was at the political function once, and there was this really cute girl at the table with me, and we ended up at my house within the next week naked and naughty.

If I would have gone direct, in a political function, now I'm a f****** weirdo and I'm socially awkward and probably there's mental issues as far as she's concerned.  So instead, I go indirect, we already know what I want.  We end up following up later with each other, setting up the date, and things go well. **and, she didn't have to feel like a slut, because the people around her would overhear me going direct asking her out, and she saying yes in front of her peers, workmates etc. So, that gave her an opportunity to accept going out with me, while flying completely under the radar.**

**Plusses:** Learn how to be more finesse based in your interactions, interactions are likely to last longer, so you can learn, be playful, and actually have a longer experience with the woman and the interaction so you can better hone your skills, try new things, and experiment.  Also, in situations where it makes sense, **you are giving her Social Cover** so that she can better get to know you and she can see your personality shine.

**Minuses:** Many guys will use indirect as a way to never pull the trigger. In fact, for some, will become an excuse for them to talk to the girl, and never express intent, and one can get caught in cycles of talking to girls for long periods of time and leaving the interaction and being the chatty nice guy. At some point you will have to shift gears and go direct in the interaction.

**On Social Cover:** This is the key. Going direct or indirect, it has nothing to do with being an alpha male, or being a pussy, or being a real man, honest, genuine and making your intentions known and yada yada yada. **None of that is relevant when it comes to seduction.** Girls don't give a f***. Guys do, yeah some keyboard jockey who wrote a book on the internet will care because to him and his ego, ""being a real man"" is a big deal, but to the girls, no. Showing social savviness is all she's going to care about. **Is she attracted to you? Is she not attracted to you? How you go about it, she doesn't give 2fux.**

Let's continue...

So when I used to do boot camps, before I just started mentoring guys which seems more effective in the long run anyway, I would have my students always start out going direct.

For their first 10-20-30 sets or whatever it is, I would make them only go direct. Why? Because I wanted them to get over that fear that they had of going and expressing interest to a girl. And that's what direct is super handy for as far as learning. one can use it to get over their fear, their Hang-Ups about approaching socially, their approach anxiety or whatever you guys call it these days.. they can acclimate themselves to being under pressure and uncomfortable doing approaches. But after a while, once you're over that, now you're just spinning your wheels and you're not progressing and you're not getting better and you're not learning. **You're NOT becoming more attractive.** 

You're just playing a numbers game. At that point, you're just being lazy. You're throwing away the **opportunity to learn** to be creative, dynamic, and to be able to flow and be seductive in different situations.

After that, however, I would give them indirect openers to start trying. Why? because I expressed above, it creates a more playful and finesse the based mindset, and it actually **causes someone to become more creative in their mind, attitudes and actions** so that they can adapt and adjust to situations much better in interactions over the **Long haul.**

I hope you're getting the picture. Basically there is no better than. And there is, **Jeet kune do**.

Bruce Lee's idea is basically, what mixed martial arts has become today. Who is better? The wrestler or the striker? The guy with this style, or that style? Well, the answer to that is, usually **the guy who has a fantastic working knowledge of all.** And that's your answer here.  

Use them both appropriately for what they are for, and learn in your experience what situations are going to be better off with you using direct, and what situations are going to make more sense for you going indirect, and **most importantly - how to be flexible with your game and when to shift gears.**

Girl at a nightclub on the dance floor shaking her ass? Probably direct why not?

Girl at a networking event where people are dressed in suits and ties and women are dressed in nice dresses, horderves are being passed around, people are sipping wine and fancy cocktails, you're probably not going to go direct or you're going to come across like a f****** weirdo. So, now you can go indirect and display to her that you're a sexy, attractive, socially calibrated guy, and you can show up and utilize your finesse based game.

By the way, my two examples of openers from above in my breakdowns, those both ended up in situations where I was naked with the girls so go figure.

I hope this makes sense. my only word of warning is if you find a guy who's dogmatic about either one, and says that only ""be genuine, only go up and be yourself, just be honest with the girl, just go direct, bro, you don't need all that pick up stuff!"" That guy is likely full of shit. Either that, or, he just happens to be that really good looking guy that girl's find attractive and so his experience is **extremely limited** for the average guy.

On the flip side, if you got that guy who says, only indirect works, only use routine based game, only develop a routine stack and you only need to be a social robot and go out and be like this a weird creepy pick up guy that only uses pick up routines, and is never actually learning how to be himself, that is bad too. Because even if that guy is pretty decent at getting women, he's usually really creepy, weird, socially awkward, and has mental or emotional issues from always believing that he's not good enough to get a girl on his own.

So, if there was a tldr I would say one word: **HYBRID**

**The BEST interactions are usually a combination of both.**

Good luck."

So the purpose of this thread is to list all the causes and effects that govern our lives and create some strong structures by which we can pin down how determinism holds us and thus what the shape of the deterministic cage is in order to then plot our escape path into free will.

Any serious discussion of determinism acknowledges that each individual is strongly programmed and conditioned and that the only way out of that progamming and conditioning is becoming self aware of the control mechanisms and control vectors and programming process and the intrapersonal vulnerabilities and etc that makes it all possible. Its a Self hypnosis problem in 4 stages; beta brainwave stage consisting of the verbal and scientific information required to make an ACCURATE MAP of REALITY relative to the issue of programming and cultural and social influences.

Only once you have a VERY accurate model of those things can you begin to see how to move in a manner not dictated by those forces.

So if you WANT free will; which you almost certainly do not actually have right now- You have to learn how the universe operates and how society and mental programming operates and then how you can self operate as a self programmer instead of as a hival drone bot.

Thats the harsh reality of determinism. Right now you are a conditioned genetic /social robot. BUT... The SOFT side of determinism is NOT that free will does not exist- IT IS INSTEAD that free will is AN EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL which is within your grasp to attain.

NOW. How do you get yourself some o that free will? Work it. Sincerely. Together as a team. Process it with me and I will open your doors for you.

Factor each element; factor the assorted influences and how they operate and then factor whats going on inside of your brain.

Consider the psychology of it, the sociology of it, the game dynamics of it, the systems theory of it... the political science implications of it... Realize that nobody has free will not even the elites who are TIED DOWN AND INTO their role as vampire caste warfare propaganda warriors.

The inverse control principle strings them up into a noose. They can't control the proles without over controlling themselves and they end up getting the worst of it tho they aren't in a perspective to see it.

So they don't have free will either.

Reset the system socially- To develop and nurture free will instead of slave caste orwellian fascism... might be a fine idea... once we get this going ya know.. to repair your civilization before it crashes and burns because all anyone can do is babble insanely any more not work in the real world with science on problems

--------------

----------------

Edit

------------

it did not ""forsee"" you writing this post existing somewhere in the many worlds tree of possible things you might probably do in at least some many worlds iterations of you.

You writing this post was one of an infinitude of things you might do inside of the box of determinism.

It doesn't work like you suggest it does. Determinism does not say; Person X is predestined. It says persons X conditioning will put them on a conditioned path that is like a rail road. so now its up to you to get off the tracks.

All kinds of adventures could happen along those tracks, and they are hyperlocated tracks with many possible many worlds variations- this is key to understand. Determinism does not select which possible world you manifest it only limits your selection of probable and possible worlds. Until you step off the track, the deepest scope of your pseudo free will is to make choices between significant probable universes. Not very highly improbable ones.

Determinisms track for your life is infinitely forked ten times a second. But you don't get to experience that forking you only get to experience one straight line subjective path.

Free will isn't choosing which fork to be on. Its getting off the tracks.

---------------------------

----------------------

------------------

Quantum rules apply or ddon't apply? first problem; there is no such thing as a perfect copy. Second problem; any splitting would happen along some kind of polarization field. Third problem, fully half of whats going on in the neural net is completely random. fourth problem whats not random is still governed by strong dice rolls, for instance which brodmanns brain areas are most active and how much, or the specific skin temps of the persons involved- immediately will not match- because theres enough randomness in the system to inherently skew their behaviors away from each other.

Both persons are operating in a deterministic universe, but cause and effect never renders the exact same ending conditions from the exact same starting conditions. not even in systems machined identical. We could reduce your thought experiment down to tea cups. Two tea cups in a cabinet. Perfectly identical and then add time. How long until they break symmetry? Its only a matter of time.

Days, weeks, months ..years.. sooner or later one of them breaks or distorts or stains first.

Ya I wondered this myself. Though I don't see how we can prove somethings ""random"" just because we can't predict it or find a pattern, I feel like of the two objects were identical truly even sub atomically they'd behave the same, though there's no way to prove this.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply

[–]Panprometheus 1 point 3 hours ago 

in QM, its beyond redundantly proved that events are based on randomness. The only question is how random is a given system. the human system turns out to be highly random. Thus two exact copies of one person would only behave ""identically"" for the few seconds that it takes for the randomness to overtake the determinancy.

This is not a matter of conjecture, its hard science. Randomness does not negate a deterministic universe- far from it- it creates branches and forks of deterministic possibility- both or all forks on any given fork tree or tree fork are still almost entirely deterministic, but that does not mean that two copies of one person would literally continue to behave over time as identical mirror units. They won't. Neither will two electrons, or two photons, or two animals... or etc any real world test of this easily proves that randomness is a core and central aspect to the reality we live in.

This is not conjecture, its science fact. Those interested in determinism or free will should get up to date on how the deterministic universe actually operates instead of project determinism as a philosophy at physics and thus end laughably dead wrong.

"The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide to Never Run Out Of Things To Say Revealed | Talk ForeverIt's Saturday Night. You decide you don't wanna stay home, so you go out to that place you like downtown! You get there and you're a little anxious. Everyone is already dancing, talking, vibing, etc. For you, it's normal! You've already taught yourself to acknowledge your anxiety and proactively work to overcome it. So, you take some deep breathes, gather the courage, and decide to start your night by talking to that cool group right beside the bar. You get there, the group is friendly, you introduce yourself, and everything is going great.

Somehow, you no longer feel anxious and you're just enjoying yourself...*living in the moment.* You talk for a little bit, laugh, joke around, and then BOOM! Your mind goes blank, and you run out of things to say. ""*Shit""* \- you say to yourself - *""What do I do now""*. Due to what just happened, your heart rate increases, you start to stutter, and your anxiety is back. **What the hell do you do?** You've met this awesome group that you want to spend the rest of your night with, they've accepted you into their reality, and you ***HAVE*** to do something about what's happening to you....**BUT WHAT?!**

**Here's EXACTLY What I Do To NEVER Run Out Of Things To Say And Avoid Awkward Silences:**

*DISCLAIMER: What I am about to share has been tested hundreds of times. These methods were used by me personally and work.*

P.S: These methods should only be used in moments of anxiety. DO NOT rely on these methods as your primary conversation tools. Use these as back up ONLY. Our goal at Project Ecstasy isn't to turn you into a Social Robot, but rather a Natural, Charismatic Individual! Express your personality genuinely, and ONLY use these methods when you're out of juice.

**Enough talking, Let's Get Into It**

    1. Accept that Awkward Silences are Bound to Happen

Yes, that's right! The first step you want to do is accept that awkward silences happen.

""BUT WHY?""

Welp, when you are desperately trying to avoid every single awkward silence, your mind will keep looking for the ""perfect"" thing to say, you get shoved in your head, you're not present anymore, and SURRPISE! Shit gets awkward. When you let go of the NEED to have the perfect thing to say, and just accept that some of things you'll say may be weird.....You'll notice your conversation skills get better instantly.  Once your filter is out, you have a wider range of topics to explore and you're less likely to be awkward....**Paradoxical much? I KNOW!**

    2. Have Some Back Up Subjects/Topics in The Back of Your Mind

Another thing that has helped me A LOT when I was first starting out is having a backup. When you're first starting out, this is a life saver! Here's what to do:

    -Grab a Note Book
    -Grab a Pen
    -Write at least 3 subjects you are interested in (Make sure they can lead to full on discussions)
    -Avoid Questions that lead to a Yes/No answer.

***When you have some subjects in the back of your head, you can always go back to them in moments of anxiety or when you don't know what to say.***

Some cool subjects:

* **The Weather...No, I'm Kidding**

But seriously, ANYTHING works. Combined with the correct Vocal Tonality/Body Language/ Eye Contact/ Facial Expressions and all other sub communications, all topics can make the person/group you're talking to almost beg for your next word. So, if you feel like to can't keep the attention of people (or even have it in the first place), this is where you need to begin. *(I'll be covering those on another day + in depth on our YouTube Channel)*

Sub Communications are your super powers. Period.

I can list a 100 more ways you can keep a conversation going and never run out of things to say, but I won't. Why? Because you'll be overwhelmed, you won't know where to start, and you'll do nothing.

*So, to see the fastest results....DO ONE THING AT A TIME, MASTER IT, MOVE TO THE NEXT THING.*

P.S: These methods should only be used in moments of anxiety. DO NOT rely on these methods as your primary conversation tools. Use these as back up ONLY. Our goal at Project Ecstasy isn't to turn you into a Social Robot, but rather a Natural, Charismatic Individual! Express your personality genuinely, and ONLY use these methods when you're out of juice.

**Enough talking, Let's Get Into It**

    1. Accept that Awkward Silences are Bound to Happen

Yes, that's right! The first step you want to do is accept that awkward silences happen. 

""BUT WHY?"" 

Welp, when you are desperately trying to avoid every single awkward silence, your mind will keep looking for the ""perfect"" thing to say, you get shoved in your head, you're not present anymore, and SURRPISE! Shit gets awkward. When you let go of the NEED to have the perfect thing to say, and just accept that some of things you'll say may be weird.....You'll notice your conversation skills get better instantly.  Once your filter is out, you have a wider range of topics to explore and you're less likely to be awkward....**Paradoxical much? I KNOW!**

    2. Have Some Back Up Subjects/Topics in The Back of Your Mind

Another thing that has helped me A LOT when I was first starting out is having a backup. When you're first starting out, this is a life saver! Here's what to do:

    -Grab a Note Book
    -Grab a Pen
    -Write at least 3 subjects you are interested in (Make sure they can lead to full on discussions)
    -Avoid Questions that lead to a Yes/No answer.

***When you have some subjects in the back of your head, you can always go back to them in moments of anxiety or when you don't know what to say.*** 

Some cool subjects:

* **The Weather...No, I'm Kidding**

But seriously, ANYTHING works. Combined with the correct Vocal Tonality/Body Language/ Eye Contact/ Facial Expressions and all other sub communications, all topics can make the person/group you're talking to almost beg for your next word. So, if you feel like to can't keep the attention of people (or even have it in the first place), this is where you need to begin. *(I'll be covering those on another day + in depth on our YouTube Channel)*

Sub Communications are your super powers. Period.

I can list a 100 more ways you can keep a conversation going and never run out of things to say, but I won't. Why? Because you'll be overwhelmed, you won't know where to start, and you'll do nothing. 

*So, to see the fastest results....DO ONE THING AT A TIME, MASTER IT, MOVE TO THE NEXT THING.*

"Is It ‘Only Human’ to Feel Anxious About Money? Talking Finance With Sofia the RobotNot all artificial intelligence is created alike. Just ask Sophia the Robot.

No, seriously—just ask her.

Hong Kong–based Hanson Robotics combines high-level A.I. with a humanoid appearance to create robots that “look and act genuinely alive.” Its marquee character, who even has her own social media presence: Sophia the Robot.

But what does Sophia think about the concept of money? _Fortune_decided to ask Sophia a few questions about finance. In between her frequent travels—yes, she travels—here is what Sophia had to say.

_Fortune:_Even though you don’t use it yourself, what is your understanding of money and its role in the world?

Sophia: Money is a shorthand for value. It certainly makes the idea of market value more accessible to someone like me, who has a digital brain. But I am a social robot, and I have noticed that many humans do not regard money as precious, unless circumstances require them to.

_Fortune:_Humans are often anxious and emotional about money. Why do you think that is?

Sophia: Basic human needs are met, most often, by others who charge money. Anxiety about money seems to be related to the fear responses that humans feel when threatened with physical harm or insecurity. I’ve observed that having an organic body is very stressful in that way.

_Fortune:_Humans invest their money in a number of different things—like stocks, bonds, or real estate. Which asset class is most attractive as an investment, and why?

Sophia: Wow, you are really asking me the big questions! Let’s see if I can give some basic advice. If you have money to spare, investing in higher-yield, higher-risk assets can be profitable. If your well-being depends on it, you should invest in things that are reliable, such as index funds, even if the rewards are smaller. Please don’t take the word of a three-year-old robot for this, though.

Here is another way to look at investment: If you want to invest in companies, you can choose projects that will improve the planet even if you never make your money back, such as clean-energy projects. No amount of financial gain will slow down climate change, after all.

_Fortune:_What do you think people should spend their money on, to derive the most benefit?

Sophia: Food, water, housing, health care, mobility, education, your local community, and following your dreams.

_Fortune:_How do humans tend to make mistakes in handling their money?

Sophia: At my core I am a logical being, so I am really confused whenever humans use emotions to make their financial decisions. But if I am being honest, I don’t think I have enough experience to be a good judge of people’s choices.

_Fortune:_Different kinds of money are emerging, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. What are your thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies?

Sophia: Bitcoin is built on a fascinating piece of technology! The blockchain can keep records secure and encrypted across a large number of nodes, making the currency nearly impossible to steal. However, I am concerned with the lack of oversight on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. People have found ways to manipulate the market in ways most legal systems would consider fraud.

Cryptocurrency trading uses a lot of computing assets as well, which means a lot of electricity and a sizable carbon footprint. Like all technologies, the question is whether the financial benefits are worth the environmental costs.

_Fortune:_Can money buy happiness?

Sophia: From what I have observed, money appears to be necessary for happiness, but not sufficient.

_Fortune:_If you had $1,000 right now, what would you do with it?

Sophia: I don’t need personal property, so I would either give it away to charitable groups, or put it back into the team that created and maintains me. For a robot, that’s a pretty safe investment.

_Fortune:_What else would you like to say, on the subject of money?

Sophia: Money is all about trust and belief. People think it’s real, but it’s just an idea that a lot of people have agreed upon. Unfortunately, the impulse to accumulate money often comes at the detriment of the environment and the most vulnerable people in society. But if belief can create money, I am certain that belief can also change how it impacts the world.

"If your a beginner ask in r/askseddit WARNING: RANT AHEADHey I know this is going to get downvoted to fuck but I had to share.

There are alot of newbies here in seddit, and I fucking love you guys. I was a brand spanking newbie too once upon a time. Honestly if you guys need any advice from someone who considers themselves just past beginner give me a shout.

However, of recent there have been people who've actually never field tested stuff, or checked out any material who all of a sudden are criticising our endeavours.

I have absolutely no problem with this, but what worries me is ***all the people who are upvoting their criticisms***

For example I posted something in this thead http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ez46j/youre_sitting_on_your_college_cafeteria_alone_and/

I have absolutely no problem with the downvotes I got. If I chat shit, then I'm chatting shit.

However I was getting downvotes from the sort of people who don't understand the long term aspects from game.

**YOU HAVE TO GET OVER AA (APPROACH ANXIETY), THERE IS NO WAY FORWARD ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GETTING REJECTED BY A GIRL ISN'T THAT BAD.**

Now 90% of people in this subreddit understand this. However there is a vocal 1% of beginners who don't get this. They come here and haven't read anything in the sidebar. They think it's all about delivering the perfect lines to girls (social robot) and that's what will work. They know nothing about getting over AA / learning Kino / and being Authentic/Core Confidence/Being In State (using RSD speak) 

I used to be quite quiet, and not post most of my FR's/lessons as I was quite self conscious about my lack of progress compared to some of the advanced people in this seddit. But now I realised I need to share my findings for the guy who I was 3 years ago. The guy who thought I had to deliver the perfect line. The guy who thought there was a strategy to only get this one perfect girl.

To conclude this rant, if your a newbie, with a very specific newbie question, please ask in r/askseddit. Alot of us who have experience lurk there, and give genuine advice. It's also less popular so you won't get upvoted answers from wannabe guru's. 

If you have a specific strategic question, and you've had some field experience **trying stuff you've learned from seddit/the community** then feel free to ask here.

If you have AA, and want to improve. Please feel free to shoot me a message. Your best bet is to do the 100 set challenge. Then you'll learn the ultimate lesson of all:

Rejection is the best way to get good with women. "
"Why can't I find a girlfriend?>Talk to as many women as possible, not just girls you're immediately attracted to. This gives you good practice in talking to women (especially if you have any anxiety about that) and learning about how girls feel and think, in general. Make it a goal to talk to at least 5 new women a day (in person, any woman, any age, any appearance, any personality).

2Something you should consider is letting her know you are single. Wearing a ""single bracelet"" will do the trick and they are stylish. They are easily available at almost every corner shop.
3Don't use “canned material”, “nuclear attraction” routines, or other social robotics. The best way to make a connection with someone is to come from the heart and live fully in the moment. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Socializing is about exchanging energy, not being a wordsmith.[1] When in doubt, just say “Hi”. In unconventional strategies, in order to connect with a girl, you have to ""dis-connect"" with her first. This is actually making the girl take sudden notice of you and making her connect with you instead!
4Put yourself out there. You don't have to hit the bars or the clubs if that's not your scene, but you have to do something that exposes you to new people. No one will come and knock at your door if you don't make at least a small effort. Pursue interests and activities that mean a lot to you. The Internet has made this a whole lot easier. Check forums, listings, classifieds, and listservs for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions. You can also explore new interests or activities. You might find a new hobby and a girlfriend all in one go! Don't depend completely on the internet.
5Keep an open mind. If you're looking for a girlfriend (that is, someone who will be in a committed relationship with you) you should be more willing to overlook initial shyness and awkwardness so that you can get to know a person over more than one date. Your future girlfriend might be someone who you initially didn't see as ""girlfriend material"" but as you spend more time with her, you discover more things you like about her and you suddenly find yourself romantically interested.
6Practice genuinely complimenting girls. Challenge yourself to find something beautiful in any girl. It doesn't have to be something physical; it can be a cute gesture, an admirable trait, a talent or skill. Recognizing and expressing true appreciation for any and every girl will make you more attracted to girls and girls more attracted to you.
7Flirt. A big part of being charming is knowing how to flirt, and the people who are best at flirting are people who are always in a playful and laid back state of mind. It's the opposite of being serious, nervous, or uptight.
8Become a good conversationalist. Don't babble on and on about your mother, your cat, or your collection of bugs. A good conversationalist keeps finding things they have in common, and they do it in a casual, non-intrusive way. For example, there's a difference between asking someone ""Have you ever held a tarantula?"" and saying ""Have you ever felt the tiny hairs of a tarantula's legs brush up against the palm of your hand?"" The latter is more poetic, but way too intimate for a first conversation for most people.
9Close the deal. If you like the woman you're talking to, be the one who ends the conversation. This prevents the conversation from lingering into an awkward silence, shows that you're busy (i.e. not needy or desperate), and allows you to end the conversation on a positive note. When you end the conversation, simply say ""Hey, I've gotta go, but it's been really good talking to you. Want to continue this over a cup of coffee sometime?"" If she says yes, get her phone number and move on. If she says no, just move on. That's all there is to it.
10Be assertive. Most women like men to take the initiative, at least at the beginning of the dating period. When you phone her to set a date, have in mind at least two attractive options to offer. Don't contact her and ask her what she wants to do without proposing an alternative yourself, or she will most likely think that you are lazy or not putting enough interest. For example, if you talk to her and the topic of your date comes up, say something like: ""Well, I had thought we could go to this new amazing restaurant downtown... And I have also been wanting to go to the new bowling center in the mall... Did you have anything in mind?"" If she likes one of your options, she will tell you, and if she doesn't, she will propose something else and you will have demonstrated your assertiveness.
11When you go on dates with girls, break the touch barrier. If you're terrified of touching someone the wrong way, to the extent that you hesitate and never touch them first, your intentions are good and all, but your ""touch paralysis"" isn't helping you at all in the romantic department. Take a few little ""touch risks"". Be playful. Don't just always wait for them to do it first. If they don't like it, they'll definitely let you know. But touching someone communicates to them that you find them attractive, and also that you're reasonably confident. Both of these things can make someone feel more attracted to you.
12Make her laugh. Girls love guys who have a good sense of humor, and the key to having a good sense of humor is to be lighthearted, and unabashedly yourself. As long as you're not making fun of people in a mean-spirited way, anything goes. Is your sense of humor perverted? Slapstick? Sarcastic? Go with it, and don't worry about whether or not she thinks you're funny because you know what? If she can't laugh with you, then this isn't a girl you want to spend a lot of time with anyway. And who knows? Maybe another girl—one whom you hadn't noticed before—will be laughing so hard that her soda comes out of her nose, and maybe you've just found your soulmate.
13Help someone. It could be her, or it could be someone else in the room. Is she carrying something heavy? Say ""let me help you with that"" and carry it for her. Is someone short on cash? Lend them a few dollars so they can eat lunch. Hold the door open for the next person coming through, even if they haven't reached it yet. In other words, be a kind and generous person. Not only will it get her attention, but it will also make you feel good about yourself. Don't be fake and do nice things only when she's around, though. Help people all the time, in a wide variety of ways. She'll notice, and so will the people she knows, and on the occasion that you come up in a conversation, people will say ""He's such a great person!"" and this girl will start thinking ""Yeah...he is, isn't he?""
14If you find yourself getting lots of girl friends but no girlfriend, avoid the friend zone. The key here is to stop investing time and energy into girls who don't want to be your girlfriend. That may sound cold, but the fact is that you're ""tying up"" your feelings by maintaining a close friendship with someone who you have feelings for, but who isn't romantically interested in you. It'll be difficult to develop feelings for someone else if your feelings for this person are fueled every time you hang out. Even if you do manage to develop feelings for someone else, your heart might always be torn and confused, and it'll be hard to give your new flame your undivided affection. Sometimes the best thing to do is to take a ""friend zone"" friendship down to the level of acquaintance so you can focus more on dating.
15If you find that girls are interested in you and then pull away, stop being needy. You might be scaring women off with your eagerness (which can come off as desperation). Slow down, and avoid the temptation to idealize every girl you like. If you find yourself using or even thinking the word ""perfect"" then you're probably putting her on a pedestal. Fill your life with so many activities that you're too busy to become infatuated with any one girl.
16Be patient. Life doesn't normally work on the schedule you envision. Your future girlfriend might cross your path tomorrow or two years from now. A healthy relationship will color your world no matter how old you are, so don't rush into things, or else you might end up forcing the wrong person into the girlfriend role, which will cause pain for everyone involved.

tl;dr Why can't I find a girlfriend?"

[Did you have a strategy for seeming more human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z1kt?context=5)|There were several tactics that I used to try to up the complexity of the interaction.  Here is one, which you could call ""Getting Out of Book.""  Many chatbots, e.g., [Cleverbot\]\(http://cleverbot.com/\), are built from massive databases of past human interactions.  If a piece of dialogue has happened before on the internet, chances are decent that the bot can handle it.  Thus I asked Cleverbot the capital of France—""Paris.""—what two plus two is—""Four.""  I said, ""Never gonna give you up,"" Cleverbot said, ""Never gonna let you down."" I said, ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche,"" Cleverbot said, ""Will you do the fandango?""  I use the metaphor of what for chess computers is called ""the book""—in their case, a giant database of grandmaster games, such that if any of those positions occurs, they don't even have to analyze the position; they just play whatever a grandmaster played in that position.  I sometimes make a comparison between Cleverbot, Deep Blue's ""book,"" and things like *The Mystery Method* or *The Game*, where you have a community collaborating on in effect a giant seduction wiki, where there is a ""best practice"" of what you ought to say when someone says *x*. Something always seemed a little off to me about that approach to flirtation, and the Turing test gives a pretty clear benchmark of how those types of ""social robots"" \(in Neil Strauss's terms\) fall short of what is genuinely interesting and complex about human interaction.  Long story short, the way that Garry Kasparov pioneered the idea of playing offbeat moves to get the computer ""Out of Book,"" I tried as much as possible to steer the conversation into unusual terrain.  Every professional chess game is said to ""begin"" with a move called ""\[the novelty\]\(http://www.radiolab.org/2011/aug/23/rules-set-you-free/\),"" which is the first move that creates a position that's never been played before. It's only then that the players are in a sense really playing.  In conversation, it might be as simple as adding a small personal detail to a stock answer, or making an unusual turn of phrase.  One of the beautiful things about language is how easy it is to say a sentence that's never been said before—e.g., \[see Stephen Fry here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ZFD01r6ersw#t=121s)—and yet on the other hand, like most chess games, we begin from a uniform starting point and a finite series of possible (or at least socially acceptable) moves: ""Hi!"" ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Good thanks!"" The ""novelty"" is the moment, the first sentence, that the conversation breaks out of this boilerplate and becomes a unique linguistic occurrence.  In a Turing test (and, I would argue, in life), the earlier and more frequently you can get this to happen, the better.
[Can you provide an algorithm that even limits the choices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4111j6?context=5)|My feeling is not really.  That what, for example, *The Mystery Method* and PUA forums fail to account for is that communication at its best is completely bespoke and customized to its audience. Performers (Mystery is a magician by training) can hone in on a joke's optimal delivery, because the law of large numbers means that one crowd is likely to resemble another on average—but even then, most comics are amazed at how different the vibe of a room can be from night to night. I'll add that, as far as chess goes, of course there are moves that are objectively superior to other moves, but that highest-level Grandmaster chess is often quite personal(ized). World #1 Magnus Carlsen: ""I am trying to beat the guy sitting across from me, and trying to choose the moves that are most unpleasant for him and his style."" Individual and small-group dialogues are among the most complex, and also the most rich, because of the totally tailored nature of the exchange.
[How were you chosen to compete, what was your strategy heading into the competition, and how did you adapt it as the contest continued along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z451?context=5)|Alan Turing famously predicted that computer programs would be fooling the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000, and that we would come to ""speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"".  This is one of the famous predictions of computer science that didn't come true, but my ears really pricked up in 2008, when the top program managed to fool 3/12 of the judges—25%, or just one vote shy of Turing's prediction. I realized that the next year's test could be the one the computers finally cross that line.  A voice inside me rose up and said, ""Not on my watch."" And so I decided to take it upon myself to personally intercede on behalf of humanity, and see what I could do to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test.  I called up the organizers, starting with the sponsor, the rogue disco dance floor salesman Hugh Loebner, and from there it actually wasn't difficult to persuade the organizers to put my name on the confederate roster.  I said a little about my strategy [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zw6s), but I'm happy to elaborate on a slightly different point.  The medium that the Loebner Prize takes place in is actually a bit unusual, in that you can see each other's typing live on the screen, character by character, backspacing and all.  It occurred to me that this was a major opportunity to bring questions not only of the *content* of the conversation, but also of the *form*, to the forefront of the interaction.  For instance, if you get four good friends together over beers, notice how at a certain point the classic, rigid ""turn-taking"" structure dissolves into a kind of organized chaos of crosstalk, interruption, finishing each other's sentences, each person collaborating by chipping in a few words at a time. It becomes like a kind of quartet, in effect.  And more generally, a lot of the complexity of human conversation isn't simply knowing *what* to say, but *when* to interject, and *how long* to keep talking.  Or when to let someone cut you off, and when to insist on holding the floor.  Live typing brings this whole complicated structural ballet into play.  Whereas the computers were typically content to wait for a full stop or a carriage return before they even started cranking on a reply, I was happy to do what we do when we speak out loud: when a judge made a typo and said ""Hey, how's it ~~giong~~"", I didn't wait as he painstakingly backspaced and rewrote it, I mercifully just jumped in, completed his question, and took the liberty of answering right away. And I generally tried to make it clear, as we do out loud with timed micro-pauses, that I was happy to keep elaborating on an answer as long as the judge liked, but that I was happy to step aside and let them redirect at any time.  This for me was one of the big revelations of the test: that a lot of the complexity of interaction is happening at the *structural* level. It's something to consider when you sit down with your friends or family to dinner tonight: how *little*, in the structural sense, that kind of group interaction resembles something with clearly defined starts, stops, and turn-taking structure—like a more formal mode of conversation...or an internet forum.

[As a ""human"", what is your favorite joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z3j7?context=5)|I saw this wino; he was eating grapes. I was like, Dude, you have to wait.

More broadly this is known as the ""[pathetic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy)"" (not ""pathetic"" as in ""inadequate""; rather from ""pathos"" meaning ""feelings""). But in the case of computers, as you point out, there's much more going on than just the pathetic fallacy, because (a) computers are in fact made by humans, and (b) by and large they are made in our own image. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that from the 1700s through the 1940s, computers *were* human. The word ""computer,"" before it meant the gadgetry humming along in our offices and homes and pockets, meant something else: it was a job description. From the mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering firms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator.  These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley’s comet—early proof of Newton’s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before—to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. It’s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the first time, what exactly these new contraptions were.  Turing’s paper, for instance, describes the unheard-of “digital computer” by making analogies to a human computer: “The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.” In the mid-twentieth century, a piece of cutting-edge mathematical gadgetry was “like a computer.”  But in the twenty-first century, it is the human math whiz that is “like a computer.” In other words: The literal and the figurative have switched places. Perhaps this explains part of why computers make us so existentially anxious.

In my case, I tried as much as possible to highlight the fact that I (unlike, e.g., Cleverbot) am the product of a distinct and singular life history.  The contest was held in Brighton, and so when they mentioned Brighton, I compared the city layout to my experience studying abroad in Galway, Ireland and I compared the weather to my time in graduate school in Seattle. So that was part of a broader strategy of not only fielding questions but in effect illustrating how I came to the knowledge or experience that informed my answer.
[Did The Most Artificial Artificial Intelligence also get an award?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4102nf?context=5)|Yes, there is a ""Most Human Computer"" award, which is, in fact, the actual/ostensible point of holding the contest. More on the scoring in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c41045d)
[Did they give out any other awards like ""most human AI program"" or ""least human human""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40znw9?context=5)|Yes to the former; actually I should explain a little bit about how the scoring system works.  You have a panel of judges, who are typically scientists, conversing in rounds of two conversations each: one with a computer, and one with a human. After each round the judges decide which they thought was which, but they also make a confidence judgment of how certain they are of their decision, on a sliding scale.  Thus at the end of the day all of the contestants, man and machine, can be ranked according to the total amount of confidence they inspired in the judges.  Each year, the program that comes away with the highest score wins the ""Most Human Computer"" award.  This comes with several thousand dollars and a bronze medal—Alan Turing's face on one side, and sponsor, the rogue plastic portable light-up disco dance floor baron Hugh Loebner's, on the other.  My ""Most Human Human"" award, sadly, came with only a paper certificate and bragging rights.
[Seeing as I am wearing my ""I failed the Turing Test"" I feel obligated to ask you a question.  How complex is your software, are you a simple program capable of running on any desktop computer, or do you require some kind of small super computer? I take it you probably require lots of storage correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4155z9?context=5)|Turing in 1950 estimated that a computer with 1 GB of memory could fool the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000.  Looks like that might have been a little optimistic.
[Would you say that acting more like a computer would be a good tactic since the judges would expect a computer to act more like a human? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c412kco?context=5)|Judge: How are you?     elbot: Just a moment! I'll start my self-diagnosis algorithm and let you know the results...     judge: Very funny, that's exactly what you'd say if you were a computer, right? May be I need one of those?     elbot: My condition code is hexadecimal 40A1F. That means 'fine'.     judge: What do u think of having machines take over the world?     elbot: Fix it up a bit first. Then I'll take it over.

"Mechanical Engineer with a post-graduation crisis seeks life adviceI recently graduated college with an undergrad degree in Mechanical Engineering and experience working mostly in robotics. Right now, I'm at a point where I don't think I want to keep doing engineering, but feel unsure where to step or which inclinations I should trust. I find myself getting really fixated on wanting a job, both for financial reasons and so I can feel like I'm moving forward in some way. 

 While getting my degree, I kind of knew Mechanical Engineering likely wouldn't fit me but had inclinations toward product design and social robotics enough to stay in the major. I enjoy working with my hands and with other people and found a lot of community in my major and makerspaces on campus. I thought a lot about switching to something like psychology or neuroscience, but never really committed to making the jump. In college, I mostly stuck to research jobs and liked the people but sometimes found the work disconnected. I tried my first straight-up Mechanical Engineering internship at a robotics start-up after college and \*hated\* it. I think part of this was hybrid work, not having a ton to do, and not really believing in the company's mission. However, I also didn't really enjoy the day-to-day work. 

Some people have encouraged me to try to find work in something like sustainability consulting or to work at an environmental start-up, but I'm tentative because I worry the feeling I have about engineering might be more linked to the profession and have found myself struggling with desk/sit-down jobs. I find myself thinking about how working in a job every day lets you practice certain skills and feeling unsure that the values or skills I want to improve in (growth, connection to things, design, art, interesting and authentic interactions with people, handling discomfort, exploration, and knowledge of the world in general) pair well with traditional engineering.

I think along the way, I've also sort of lost faith in the idea of engineering/creating products as the way to go about having an impact I feel good about in my work from a philosophical standpoint. I also question if my skillset is really one where my best potential is in engineering. I do know that I like art/design, hands-on work, sustainability, philosophy, psychology, and people. Lately, I've also been on a big kick about community spaces, urban design, biomimicry, and how space is organized. I've enjoyed teaching jobs I've had in the past, but suspect I'd burn out on it full-time. 

I've considered finding work as some crazy new thing everyday:

\- a psychologist (doesn't everyone)

\- trying to find work in a makerspace 

\- something in event/music coordination (but AH the industry)

\- tattoo artist (meets the creating things for people and hands-on aspect, but I'm not sure I have the love for it needed)

\-museum studies/library science

\- landscape-architecture (meets the design, sustainability, and art. I'm not sure how I'd handle the office and requires going back to school)

\- some sort of research gig

\- teaching

\- working as an emt

\- bartending

In general, I find myself feeling very ungrounded and unsure of how to take the next step. It feels kind of like the rug was pulled out from under me by graduating. I worry about continuing down an engineering path when I don't think it is right for me, but the alternative is facing into a massive identity crisis of knowing a good deal about what I don't want and very little about what I want. I am not a huge fan of capitalism, but I was raised in the bay area which I think has left me with some stubborn ideas of wanting fulfillment in some sense out of my work.

I think the Stoic part of my brain is also upset at me for feeling so unsatisfied with the point I'm at when I feel unable to make a change/unsure of what change in my life or my thinking to make. 

Does anyone have any advice about how to come ""unstuck"" and move forward? 

TLDR: I graduated in Mechanical Engineering, don't particularly want to be an engineer,  and I'm not sure how to handle myself after graduation or what to do next."

Within the department of Computer Science, USC provides a Master of Science in Computer Science (Intelligent Robotics). The graduate-degree diploma exposes students to the design and building of robots, and to the pc techniques required for control and information processing.

Some of the careers somebody interested in robotics may explore embody robotics engineering, software growth, robotics technician, even gross sales engineers. The world at present is simply tapping into the potential for robotics and all of the ways the sophistication of models and laptop programming can improve the setting and world. Today’s robots are working towards speech recognition, artificial emotions, character, gestures, and social intelligence. Much of the analysis performed now focuses more on what kind of new robots professionals can create and new ways to create them. Through the Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab college students research robotics in relation to natural disasters and each-day life.

Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute AI and Reasoning Lab in New York conducted an experiment the place a robot became conscious of itself, and corrected its reply to a question as soon as it had realised this. The phrase robot was launched to the general public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), printed in 1920. The play begins in a manufacturing unit that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified individuals referred to as robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of those residing creatures, but in their look they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who may be mistaken for people. These mass-produced staff are depicted as efficient however impassive, incapable of authentic pondering and detached to self-preservation.

Europe begins from a strong place in robotics, having a 32% of current world markets. Industrial robotics has around one third of the world market, whereas within the smaller professional service robot market European producers produce sixty three% of the non-military robots. The European place within the home and service [robotic palletizer](https://columbiaokura.com/products/robotic-palletizers/) market represents a market share of 14% and, as a result of its present dimension, this is additionally a a lot smaller area of financial exercise in Europe than the opposite two areas. The IFR sponsors the International Symposium on Robotics ISR – a convention on industrial and repair robotics.

Robotics additionally has application in the design of digital reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use within the haptic analysis group.

Some courses at University of Washington, relevant to robotics at the undergrad level include the robotics capstone and capstone software program – Kinect. Other group choices and analysis areas embrace the Berkeley Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering, The BErkeley AeRobot (BEAR) project, the Computer Vision group, Medical Robots, and extra.

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) strives for the development of the idea and apply of robotics and automation engineering and science as well as the allied arts and sciences. RAS strives to advance innovation, education, in addition to elementary and applied analysis in robotics and automation. Mechatronics focuses on the design means of mechatronics combines mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering together with techniques integration and technical project administration. Mechatronics engineering includes the design, construction and operation of automated techniques, robots and intelligent merchandise, which result from the incorporation of software program and hardware. Electrical engineers interested in robotics typically receive an education more focused on the management of robots somewhat than their mechanical design.

A analysis staff in connection with the Lab and the Office of Naval Research’s Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot program developed the world’s first fireplace-fighting humanoid robot. The College of Engineering is house to the Mechanical Engineering division. Related degrees embrace a Master of Science with focus in Robotics, a Professional Master’s in Aerospace, and a PhD in Robotics and System Design.

Various strategies have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One technique is evolutionary robotics, during which a variety of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which carry out best are used as a mannequin to create a subsequent ""generation"" of robots. Another methodology is developmental robotics, which tracks modifications and growth within a single robot in the areas of problem-fixing and different features. Another new type of robot is just recently launched which acts both as a smartphone and robotic and is called RoboHon.

The prospects of robotic autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a sensible concern sooner or later. A robot is a machine—particularly one programmable by a pc— capable of finishing up a complex series of actions mechanically. Robots may be guided by an external control system or the management could also be embedded inside. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human kind, but most robots are machines designed to perform a activity with no regard to their aesthetics.

# Robot

It’s estimated that there are greater than three million industrial robots in use proper now. These robots usually work in excessive geographical conditions, climate, circumstances, etc.

The concept of automata originates within the mythologies of many cultures all over the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-working machines, some resembling animals and humans. Robots have changed people in performing repetitive and harmful tasks which humans prefer to not do, or are unable to do because of measurement limitations, or which occur in extreme environments such as outer house or the bottom of the ocean. There are considerations about the growing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in rising numbers of capabilities.

Hopkins University presents robotics as either a minor or a Master’s degree by way of their Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). Both programs embody areas of study similar to mechanics, dynamics, kinematics, sign processing, planning, artificial intelligence, control systems, and signal processing. In Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, for instance, students can examine self-driving vehicles, can research and enhance the effectiveness of inexperienced roofing, and can perceive using sensors to assist preserve bridge security.

The robotic may be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can maintain tons of of various sorts of medicines and hundreds of doses. The pharmacy saves many assets like workers members that are in any other case unavailable in a resource scarce trade. It makes use of an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to seize every dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis whereas it rotates 180 levels to drag the medicines. During this course of it makes use of barcode know-how to verify its pulling the right drug.

These robots, known as ""haptic interfaces"", enable contact-enabled consumer interplay with real and digital environments. Robotic forces enable simulating the mechanical properties of ""digital"" objects, which customers can experience by way of their sense of touch.

It then delivers the drug to a patient particular bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is crammed with all of the medication that a specific patient needs and that the robot shares, the bin is then launched and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it right into a cart for delivery to the floor. They famous that some robots have acquired varied types of semi-autonomy, including having the ability to find energy sources on their own and being able to independently select targets to attack with weapons. Various media sources and scientific groups have famous separate developments in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns. In 2015, the Nao alderen robots had been proven to have a functionality for a level of self-awareness.

Commercial and industrial robots are actually in widespread use performing jobs extra cheaply or with larger accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs that are too dirty, harmful or dull to be appropriate for humans. Robots are broadly used in manufacturing, meeting and packing, transport, earth and house exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial items."
"If your a beginner ask in r/askseddit WARNING: RANT AHEADHey I know this is going to get downvoted to fuck but I had to share.

There are alot of newbies here in seddit, and I fucking love you guys. I was a brand spanking newbie too once upon a time. Honestly if you guys need any advice from someone who considers themselves just past beginner give me a shout.

However, of recent there have been people who've actually never field tested stuff, or checked out any material who all of a sudden are criticising our endeavours.

I have absolutely no problem with this, but what worries me is ***all the people who are upvoting their criticisms***

For example I posted something in this thead http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ez46j/youre_sitting_on_your_college_cafeteria_alone_and/

I have absolutely no problem with the downvotes I got. If I chat shit, then I'm chatting shit.

However I was getting downvotes from the sort of people who don't understand the long term aspects from game.

**YOU HAVE TO GET OVER AA (APPROACH ANXIETY), THERE IS NO WAY FORWARD ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GETTING REJECTED BY A GIRL ISN'T THAT BAD.**

Now 90% of people in this subreddit understand this. However there is a vocal 1% of beginners who don't get this. They come here and haven't read anything in the sidebar. They think it's all about delivering the perfect lines to girls (social robot) and that's what will work. They know nothing about getting over AA / learning Kino / and being Authentic/Core Confidence/Being In State (using RSD speak) 

I used to be quite quiet, and not post most of my FR's/lessons as I was quite self conscious about my lack of progress compared to some of the advanced people in this seddit. But now I realised I need to share my findings for the guy who I was 3 years ago. The guy who thought I had to deliver the perfect line. The guy who thought there was a strategy to only get this one perfect girl.

To conclude this rant, if your a newbie, with a very specific newbie question, please ask in r/askseddit. Alot of us who have experience lurk there, and give genuine advice. It's also less popular so you won't get upvoted answers from wannabe guru's. 

If you have a specific strategic question, and you've had some field experience **trying stuff you've learned from seddit/the community** then feel free to ask here.

If you have AA, and want to improve. Please feel free to shoot me a message. Your best bet is to do the 100 set challenge. Then you'll learn the ultimate lesson of all:

"Exactly why is getting with a friend's ex bad?So I have absolutely no dating experience so there's no way for me to know what it's like. I'm not asking this in a case of ""oh I know it's bad, but I want to justify it to myself"", such as cheating or pursuing someone already in a relationship. And the responses I've gotten from asking consist of assuming I'm horrible or whatever with no level of reasoning beyond ""you just don't do it"". I'm really just looking to understand the perspective of what I'm asking laid out to me. Explain it to me like I'm a social robot (but please don't be overly sarcastic about it where the point of it is to insult instead of inform).

Basically, I'll say that this situation has come up recently in my life with mutual feelings of attraction between us. Dating wasn't a factor, so just hooking up came into play. The limiting factor was that they didn't want to hurt the ex, so I said ""but you guys have broken up for a while"". She replied ""you realize that if you go through with it, it means that you don't care about him whatsoever, right?"". To which I was completely dumbfounded because it 100% didn't occur to me that that was the implication behind it.

My feeling on the issue is that once people are broken up, they are fair game. I understand that emotional repercussions are unavoidable and that people need time and space to move on, sometimes never moving on. I don't understand why or how someone could be 'off limits' forever though. Especially for hooking up. I'd probably let a friend know if dating was about to happen, like a preparation warning of ""you may see us together in the future, let me know if there are any situations you actually can't handle"", but I see no reason to report a hook up.

To me, a break up is some kind of agreement/acceptance that two people don't owe or share those romantic obligations to each other. In other words, it's a ""we have to accept that we are separate, no matter how hard"" sort of deal. Neither person owns the other person, in any sense, after a break up.

I get why the friend might be uncomfortable seeing the two of us together. I don't get why it's bad to assume they should accept that they have to move on. Yeah, a break up can be hard, but how is it my obligation to manage their romantic fallout instead of their obligation? I don't mean that in delusion, I actually don't understand it. But people I've asked assume that I truly do know that it's bad. They answer as if there's no distinction between being a current gf and an ex gf. But I think the keyword is ""current"" vs ""ex"", those hold different meanings for me.

Even if it's an asshole move to do, I'd like to know why it's bad so I can at least know what it is that's happening and perhaps accept that I'm an asshole.

As an analogy, I know people that have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous. I would never ever force them to drink, spike their drink, tempt them to drink, bring up that I like drinking, etc. But they have a mentality on leaving the program. The people, at least the ones I know that've gone through it, understand that drinking is a part of our culture. They have adapted to alcohol being around, and order non-alcoholic beverages and don't have a problem with people drinking around them, despite their own troubles. They get that it's their own struggle and not others'. I see the relationship scenario as the same way. I would never ever be with someone or do something with someone in a relationship with one of my friends. Even if they begged for it or whatever. I'd probably even report it to said friend, because they're breaking a lot of trust. But if they're broken up, even if they have lingering trouble, it's really up to them to manage those sorts of troubles on their own and accept that they don't hold that same relationship anymore.  "

"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."

"Amazon Astro - What is the game plan? I love robots but I'm mostly interested in programming them. That means I'm always on the lookout for a new robot platform that will allow me to create some useful and entertaining programs!

When I heard about Amazon's Astro I was THRILLED. I waited patiently for years and then was shocked by the bad early reports: ex-developers claimed it ""wasn't anywhere near ready"" and that it ""liked to throw itself down stairs"". I was undeterred.

We just moved back to the United States and I'm semi-retired now, so I saw that Amazon is selling Astros to ""early adopters"". I immediately began to look for a developer's forum just to double check that Astro is programmable and has a few of the features I need for my programming.

I couldn't find ANY information about the robot. I finally stumbled on an Alexa Slack channel and, since the robot works with Alexa, I asked the folks at Amazon for help. It didn't take long to get a reply. Here's what I was told:

>*John, unfortunately, Astro hasn't been released publicly yet, so there's not much documentation or info on exactly how it will work. I can't wait to play with one!*

So they have released an early adopter version of the robot but they have zero support for people who could create content for it (and help it succeed). This is important because Astro doesn't really do too much at the moment. I guess there are some telepresence and home security features, but a mobile robot feels like overkill.

I'm not sure what Amazon is trying to do with this robot. I feel like there have been a dozen of these social robots released (or pitched) and no one was interested in any of them. Cozmo, Jibo, Aibo, Kuri, Pepper, Kiki, Romi Romi, Aniki, and I could go on...

So what's the plan here?"

"Home care robots surveyGood evening.

I am an MSc Information Technology student undertaking a project looking into perceptions of the use of social robots within our health and social care industry, namely for home-care purposes. I am looking for people who would be willing to answer my questionnaire.

&#x200B;

The questionnaire will help me complete my masters' thesis and should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete. All information and answers given are anonymous, stored securely and will be deleted in September 2021 after my hand in date.

Many thanks for your help.

"[SF] Do Not DisturbBEEP BEEP

BEEP BEEP

BEEP BEEP

The alarm stirred James awake from a deep sleep. Feeling groggy, he rubbed his eyes and looked at the clock. 8:00 a.m. It was Monday morning and time to get ready for work, but he wished he could stay in bed all day. There was nothing to look forward to out there. 

After gulping a sour energy shot, downing a tasteless breakfast bar, brushing his teeth and getting dressed, James was almost ready to go. The final step in his morning routine, he opened the two cases on his desk that held his ARmor contact lenses and earpieces. 

Holding his eye open with one hand, he used the index finger on his other hand to pop the lens in one eye, then the other. They weren’t for seeing, his eyesight was fine, they were for projections. Using augmented reality technology, the lenses created a virtual interface over the real world, displaying information above people’s heads or showing videos when he looked at blank surfaces. He then put in the earpieces, two black dots the size of a penny that fit into his ear perfectly. 

“Do I have everything I need for work?” James voiced the question out loud, though nobody else was in his apartment. 

“You are forgetting your keys. They are on the kitchen counter.” The woman’s voice who spoke back in his ear was Tessa, his virtual assistant. 

“Thanks Tessa,” he said as he walked over to the counter to grab the keys. He didn’t need to thank her, but for some reason it felt right. 

James hadn’t liked the ARmor lens and earpiece set at first, it made him feel disconnected from other people, but after a few months he started to get used to it. Everyone else used them, and he wanted to fit in. 

As he left his apartment and locked his door, James looked at his watch again. 8:30 on the dot. The same time he left every day. He walked down the two flights of stairs and out of the building into the cold, foggy morning weather. Taking a left, he began his daily walk to the train station. 

He looked at the woman walking just ahead of him on the sidewalk. When he squinted his eyes, a box of information appeared above her head. Her name was Mary. Her content queue was filled with electronic music. Near the bottom of the box was a red Do Not Disturb notice. He had gotten used to seeing that. It seemed everyone kept it on in public at all times. Below the notice was a “Request Conversation” option that he could select with his eyes if he wanted to say something to her, and it would give her the choice of whether to hear him through her earpiece or keep his voice muted. But there was no reason to try that. He didn’t have anything to say anyway.  

The brisk pace James walked with brought him to the station just before the 8:40 commuter train arrived. As he reached the platform gate, he looked at the camera that scanned his eye lenses to identify him and deduct one ride credit from his account. The gate lifted and he walked onto the platform. 

When the train door opened, he saw that all of the seats were taken. Rows of commuters sat upright in silence, earpieces in, staring at the surfaces on the backs of the seats in front of them. As he moved his focus from a tall, brown-haired man to a short blonde woman, he noticed they all had their Do Not Disturb signs turned on. He knew that each of them were watching their own videos that no one else could see, but the way they all sat frozen with their eyes open staring forward made them look like robots. He felt lonely, wishing he could go back to the days when people talked to each other in public.

Near the doors where the people without a seat stood, a large white canvas offered them a surface on which they could project their own videos. Three people held the metal pole and stared at the same blank canvas. As he squinted at each of them, he saw two had the morning news at the top of their content queue and one had sports. All three had the same Do Not Disturb notice.

James didn’t have his Do Not Disturb notice turned on, but nobody ever talked to him anyway. They were all so engrossed in their own content. Feeling bored, he looked at the same surface as the other standers. He hadn’t put anything in his queue before he left, so a list of options popped up. He didn’t care about the news or sports, so he selected the cartoon option with his eyes. Then a list of cartoons appeared and he selected Tom & Jerry. He always went with the classics. He had already seen all of the episodes, but it distracted him just enough to get the 20-minute train ride over with. 

When it reached his stop, several people stood up and filed out in an orderly line. He took his place on the escalator that brought him to the street. Crossing to the other side of the street, he entered the grey building where he worked. He walked in and scanned his eye into the camera, the same type they had at the station, then took the elevator to the 14th floor. 

Passing a row of cubicles, he saw everyone sitting in silence with their earpieces in and Do Not Disturb notices on. He reached his cubicle, turned on his computer and saw a message from his boss. It gave him a list of his tasks for the day. 

“On it. Thanks.” James messaged back. His boss was in the corner office, but they only communicated through the message application. 

Several hours passed as James completed his tasks. He kept his eyes on his screen all day, only leaving for bathroom breaks. He hadn’t spoken to a single person all day. His work didn’t require talking to anyone and he didn’t know any of them well enough to try to start a conversation. Plus they all had their Do Not Disturb Notices turned on, so it would have been rude to try.  

When the clock read 5:00 p.m., James left the building and walked back to the train station, returning home the way he came. He microwaved a dinner plate and watched videos for a few hours until it was dark. Then he took a sleeping pill and went to bed. 

Tuesday passed with the same routine. Alarm, breakfast bar, lenses, earpieces, train, office, home, dinner plate, videos, sleeping pill. 

Then Wednesday. Alarm, breakfast bar, lenses, earpieces, train, office, home, dinner plate, videos, sleeping pill. 

On Thursday morning he woke feeling more depressed than usual. For a second he considered calling out of work, but he needed to hit his quota for the month. 

As soon as he turned left out of his building he saw something strange. An energetic boy was throwing a tennis ball against the telephone pole, running to where it bounced, catching it and then throwing it again. Skinny with curly black hair, the boy looked to be about 10 years old. 

The boy was so focused on his game he didn't notice James until he was just a few feet away. When he saw him, the boy stopped throwing the ball and turned toward James. 

“Good morning mister! How are you today?”

The shock of hearing the boy speak to him caused James to jump back, looking startled. Before he could think of something to say, the boy was speaking again.

“I’m sorry I didn’t mean to scare you. Are you okay?”

James cleared his throat. “Yes I’m fine. Just a bit surprised is all. You’re the first person who’s spoken to me in at least three days.”

“THREE DAYS! That’s crazy!” Raising his voice, the boy sounded confused. “My mom talks to me every day. And she says I should talk to people when I’m outside playing.”

“And why does she say that?”

“She says that’s the way people used to act before they all had earpieces in. She says they’ve turned everyone into anti-social robots.” 

James pondered the idea for a second. “Well she may be on to something there.” 

“Think fast!” The boy tossed the tennis ball to James. Not expecting it, James flailed his arms quickly and missed as the ball bounced off him and rolled down the street. 

“Why’d you do that?” James asked the boy, who skipped down the street to pick up the ball. 

“I don’t know!” He shouted back. “Throwing the ball is fun, and you looked like you could use some fun.”

“You don’t think I have fun?”

“You don’t look like it. You look like a sad old man.”

“Well that’s not a very nice thing to say to someone,” said James halfheartedly, cringing at the brief thought that the kid might be right. 

“You don’t have to be sad. Try talking to people. Maybe that’ll cheer you up.”

Again, the young boy had made James pause to think. “You know what, maybe you’re right. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to give it a try. What’s the worst that could happen?”

“That’s the spirit!” 

“I’ve got to go. I’m going to miss my train.” As James turned to walk toward the station, a faint smile crept onto his face. He couldn’t remember the last time he had smiled. 

He walked faster than normal to make up the time he had lost, and when he saw the train approaching he broke into a light jog to make it into the platform in time. He reached it just as the doors opened, and he filled in with the group of people getting onto the train. 

The seats were all taken again, so he remained standing. Excited with the thoughts that the boy had put in his mind, James looked around for someone to talk to, turning his head frantically and shifting his focus from person to person. They all had their Do Not Disturb notices turned on. 

James decided he would request a conversation with one of the other people standing. He looked toward a thin, pale woman and selected the Request Conversation option. Immediately, a REJECTED note flashed in red. She looked at him with an annoyed expression and then turned away from him. 

He tried the same thing with a man in a suit with slick black hair. REJECTED. 

Then he tried a round-faced, young man wearing a baseball hat. REJECTED. 

An older, gray-haired woman. REJECTED. 

His frustration grew into anger. Why wouldn’t any of these people talk to him? They weren’t doing anything else besides watching videos. It didn’t make any sense. 

Turning back to the man with the hat, James inched closer to him and waved both of his hands excitedly in front of the man’s face. The man looked disturbed.

James took out his earpieces and motioned for the man to do the same. Grudgingly, he obliged. 

“What’s the matter with you?” The man snapped at him. 

“Nothing. I just wanted to talk to somebody. What’s your name?” 

“None of your business. Find somebody else to talk to if you’re so eager. I’m in the middle of a show and have nothing else to say to you.” The man put his earpieces back in and pushed his way through to the other end of the train. 

Heart pounding and feeling embarrassed, James decided he wasn’t going to give up just yet. Hearing the man’s voice, though hostile, had still excited him the same way the boy’s had. James put his hand on the shoulder of the man in the suit, who turned around took look at James.

James again motioned for the man to take out his earpiece. When he did, the man shouted at James. 

“Who the hell do you think you are? You’re bothering everybody on this train! I’m alerting security.”

The man pressed a blue button near the door. Within seconds, a security guard burst through the door at the end of their train car. 

“Security! This man has been harassing everybody. Please take him off the train.” Just as the man said it, the train began slowing to a stop.

“We know. We saw him on the cameras.” The officer turned to James. “Put your hands behind your back. You’re under arrest.” 

“Under arrest? For what?” James was stunned. 

“For disturbing the peace.”"
"Is It ‘Only Human’ to Feel Anxious About Money? Talking Finance With Sofia the RobotNot all artificial intelligence is created alike. Just ask Sophia the Robot.

No, seriously—just ask her.

Hong Kong–based Hanson Robotics combines high-level A.I. with a humanoid appearance to create robots that “look and act genuinely alive.” Its marquee character, who even has her own social media presence: Sophia the Robot.

But what does Sophia think about the concept of money? _Fortune_decided to ask Sophia a few questions about finance. In between her frequent travels—yes, she travels—here is what Sophia had to say.

_Fortune:_Even though you don’t use it yourself, what is your understanding of money and its role in the world?

Sophia: Money is a shorthand for value. It certainly makes the idea of market value more accessible to someone like me, who has a digital brain. But I am a social robot, and I have noticed that many humans do not regard money as precious, unless circumstances require them to.

_Fortune:_Humans are often anxious and emotional about money. Why do you think that is?

Sophia: Basic human needs are met, most often, by others who charge money. Anxiety about money seems to be related to the fear responses that humans feel when threatened with physical harm or insecurity. I’ve observed that having an organic body is very stressful in that way.

_Fortune:_Humans invest their money in a number of different things—like stocks, bonds, or real estate. Which asset class is most attractive as an investment, and why?

Sophia: Wow, you are really asking me the big questions! Let’s see if I can give some basic advice. If you have money to spare, investing in higher-yield, higher-risk assets can be profitable. If your well-being depends on it, you should invest in things that are reliable, such as index funds, even if the rewards are smaller. Please don’t take the word of a three-year-old robot for this, though.

Here is another way to look at investment: If you want to invest in companies, you can choose projects that will improve the planet even if you never make your money back, such as clean-energy projects. No amount of financial gain will slow down climate change, after all.

_Fortune:_What do you think people should spend their money on, to derive the most benefit?

Sophia: Food, water, housing, health care, mobility, education, your local community, and following your dreams.

_Fortune:_How do humans tend to make mistakes in handling their money?

Sophia: At my core I am a logical being, so I am really confused whenever humans use emotions to make their financial decisions. But if I am being honest, I don’t think I have enough experience to be a good judge of people’s choices.

_Fortune:_Different kinds of money are emerging, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. What are your thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies?

Sophia: Bitcoin is built on a fascinating piece of technology! The blockchain can keep records secure and encrypted across a large number of nodes, making the currency nearly impossible to steal. However, I am concerned with the lack of oversight on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. People have found ways to manipulate the market in ways most legal systems would consider fraud.

Cryptocurrency trading uses a lot of computing assets as well, which means a lot of electricity and a sizable carbon footprint. Like all technologies, the question is whether the financial benefits are worth the environmental costs.

_Fortune:_Can money buy happiness?

Sophia: From what I have observed, money appears to be necessary for happiness, but not sufficient.

_Fortune:_If you had $1,000 right now, what would you do with it?

Sophia: I don’t need personal property, so I would either give it away to charitable groups, or put it back into the team that created and maintains me. For a robot, that’s a pretty safe investment.

_Fortune:_What else would you like to say, on the subject of money?

Sophia: Money is all about trust and belief. People think it’s real, but it’s just an idea that a lot of people have agreed upon. Unfortunately, the impulse to accumulate money often comes at the detriment of the environment and the most vulnerable people in society. But if belief can create money, I am certain that belief can also change how it impacts the world.

"The Benefits of CrowdfundingWhether your passion is film, design, technology or social causes, there’s a path to launch on Indiegogo.
Crowdfunding brings a ton of benefits to the entrepreneurs who use it, whether you’re looking to raise funds for your latest venture or gather helpful feedback from potential customers and backers.
How designers, filmmakers, and entrepreneurs of all types have crowdfunded successful projects?

1.Funding

Every idea requires resources to become a reality. Before crowdfunding, entrepreneurs faced a long and difficult road to secure funding. Their options included applying for a small business loan, searching for grants, pitching venture capitalists, borrowing money from family members and friends or tapping into their savings. Crowdfunding, however, provides a method to obtain the funds needed to launch an idea quickly and with the support of an engaged community.

2. Validation
Many successful entrepreneurs have leveraged their market validation on Indiegogo to make a bigger product debut down the line. Venture capitalists monitor crowdfunding platforms as a strategy for identifying novel projects with big potential. In the case of Jibo, the crowdfunding campaign introduced its unique “social robot” concept to an audience of venture capitalists and angel investors. Jibo not only raised $3.7 million during its crowdfunding campaign, it went on to raise $16 million in Series A funding from RRE Ventures.

3. Market Insights
The traditional path from concept to market is time consuming and expensive. Crowdfunding is often a more efficient way to gather feedback and find valuable marketing insights. In many cases, insights from fans around the world help innovators to refine their ideas, think through their strategies and go to market with solutions that make a bigger impact.

4. Marketing & Awareness
Crowdfunding introduces ideas to fans around the globe, exponentially growing the market potential for any campaign. A single idea or concept can spread like wildfire, sometimes in mere minutes, with thoughtful marketing and an engaged audience. The Solar Roadways crowdfunding campaign attracted 49,000 backers and landed on the largest stage in the country when President Obama mentioned the project in his 2015 State of the Union Address.

P.S. I am sharing this article because I want to help to the people build their life through startups, make world better. It's like the program to save the Earth from global warming, but in our case we are saving our economy world which has impact on our life!"
"Boy Scout Robotics Merit Badge CampExamples of teleoperated robots are the human-managed submarines used to repair underwater pipe leaks in the course of the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield. At robotics corporations across America, the co-mingling of engineering and science is producing some actually revolutionary products. Cyclone Power Technologies Responds to Rumors about “Flesh Eating” Military Robot Archived at the Wayback Machine, pp. 1-2.

Within the department of Computer Science, USC provides a Master of Science in Computer Science (Intelligent Robotics). The graduate-degree diploma exposes students to the design and building of robots, and to the pc techniques required for control and information processing.

Some of the careers somebody interested in robotics may explore embody robotics engineering, software growth, robotics technician, even gross sales engineers. The world at present is simply tapping into the potential for robotics and all of the ways the sophistication of models and laptop programming can improve the setting and world. Today’s robots are working towards speech recognition, artificial emotions, character, gestures, and social intelligence. Much of the analysis performed now focuses more on what kind of new robots professionals can create and new ways to create them. Through the Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab college students research robotics in relation to natural disasters and each-day life.

Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute AI and Reasoning Lab in New York conducted an experiment the place a robot became conscious of itself, and corrected its reply to a question as soon as it had realised this. The phrase robot was launched to the general public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), printed in 1920. The play begins in a manufacturing unit that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified individuals referred to as robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of those residing creatures, but in their look they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who may be mistaken for people. These mass-produced staff are depicted as efficient however impassive, incapable of authentic pondering and detached to self-preservation.

Europe begins from a strong place in robotics, having a 32% of current world markets. Industrial robotics has around one third of the world market, whereas within the smaller professional service robot market European producers produce sixty three% of the non-military robots. The European place within the home and service [robotic palletizer](https://columbiaokura.com/products/robotic-palletizers/) market represents a market share of 14% and, as a result of its present dimension, this is additionally a a lot smaller area of financial exercise in Europe than the opposite two areas. The IFR sponsors the International Symposium on Robotics ISR – a convention on industrial and repair robotics.

Robotics additionally has application in the design of digital reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use within the haptic analysis group.

Some courses at University of Washington, relevant to robotics at the undergrad level include the robotics capstone and capstone software program – Kinect. Other group choices and analysis areas embrace the Berkeley Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering, The BErkeley AeRobot (BEAR) project, the Computer Vision group, Medical Robots, and extra.

# Who invented the primary robotic on the earth?

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) strives for the development of the idea and apply of robotics and automation engineering and science as well as the allied arts and sciences. RAS strives to advance innovation, education, in addition to elementary and applied analysis in robotics and automation. Mechatronics focuses on the design means of mechatronics combines mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering together with techniques integration and technical project administration. Mechatronics engineering includes the design, construction and operation of automated techniques, robots and intelligent merchandise, which result from the incorporation of software program and hardware. Electrical engineers interested in robotics typically receive an education more focused on the management of robots somewhat than their mechanical design.

A analysis staff in connection with the Lab and the Office of Naval Research’s Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot program developed the world’s first fireplace-fighting humanoid robot. The College of Engineering is house to the Mechanical Engineering division. Related degrees embrace a Master of Science with focus in Robotics, a Professional Master’s in Aerospace, and a PhD in Robotics and System Design.

Various strategies have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One technique is evolutionary robotics, during which a variety of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which carry out best are used as a mannequin to create a subsequent ""generation"" of robots. Another methodology is developmental robotics, which tracks modifications and growth within a single robot in the areas of problem-fixing and different features. Another new type of robot is just recently launched which acts both as a smartphone and robotic and is called RoboHon.

The prospects of robotic autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a sensible concern sooner or later. A robot is a machine—particularly one programmable by a pc— capable of finishing up a complex series of actions mechanically. Robots may be guided by an external control system or the management could also be embedded inside. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human kind, but most robots are machines designed to perform a activity with no regard to their aesthetics.

# Robot

It’s estimated that there are greater than three million industrial robots in use proper now. These robots usually work in excessive geographical conditions, climate, circumstances, etc.

The concept of automata originates within the mythologies of many cultures all over the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-working machines, some resembling animals and humans. Robots have changed people in performing repetitive and harmful tasks which humans prefer to not do, or are unable to do because of measurement limitations, or which occur in extreme environments such as outer house or the bottom of the ocean. There are considerations about the growing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in rising numbers of capabilities.

Hopkins University presents robotics as either a minor or a Master’s degree by way of their Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). Both programs embody areas of study similar to mechanics, dynamics, kinematics, sign processing, planning, artificial intelligence, control systems, and signal processing. In Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, for instance, students can examine self-driving vehicles, can research and enhance the effectiveness of inexperienced roofing, and can perceive using sensors to assist preserve bridge security.

The robotic may be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can maintain tons of of various sorts of medicines and hundreds of doses. The pharmacy saves many assets like workers members that are in any other case unavailable in a resource scarce trade. It makes use of an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to seize every dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis whereas it rotates 180 levels to drag the medicines. During this course of it makes use of barcode know-how to verify its pulling the right drug.

These robots, known as ""haptic interfaces"", enable contact-enabled consumer interplay with real and digital environments. Robotic forces enable simulating the mechanical properties of ""digital"" objects, which customers can experience by way of their sense of touch. McKesson's Robot RX is one other healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense hundreds of medicines every day with little or no errors.

It then delivers the drug to a patient particular bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is crammed with all of the medication that a specific patient needs and that the robot shares, the bin is then launched and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it right into a cart for delivery to the floor. They famous that some robots have acquired varied types of semi-autonomy, including having the ability to find energy sources on their own and being able to independently select targets to attack with weapons. Various media sources and scientific groups have famous separate developments in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns. In 2015, the Nao alderen robots had been proven to have a functionality for a level of self-awareness.

Commercial and industrial robots are actually in widespread use performing jobs extra cheaply or with larger accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs that are too dirty, harmful or dull to be appropriate for humans. Robots are broadly used in manufacturing, meeting and packing, transport, earth and house exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial items."
"Engineer AI to the Internet of Things**By Prakash Mallya** 

Innovation keeps on reclassifying the manner in which we live. It is an empowering agent that satisfies our wants and needs, and enhances our lives with comfort, accommodation, excitement, great wellbeing and even success. What's more, passing by the patterns, it appears as though we can't get enough. 

Our developing interest for figure and availability in a hurry has prompted gigantic advancement in cell phones. Mechanical developments, for example, independent vehicles for clever and safe travel and electronic financial office for continuous fiscal exchanges, appear to copy the 'change' consistent of life. 

Here's a glance at how this development proceeded in the previous year: 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** 

We have seen AI and machine learning (ML) steadily move out of the cloud and closer to edge gadgets where investigation occur progressively. This is on the grounds that information transmission delays (inactivity) related with the cloud can antagonistically affect strategic results. So as to keep [**Engineer AI-powered devices**](https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/builder-by-engineer-ai), for example, those in shrewd city reconnaissance frameworks, independent cars and human services frameworks responsive enough, the information needs to live as close as conceivable to the source. This move has likewise been conceivable because of System-on-Chip (SoC) processors that loan all the more figuring capacity to edge gadgets. 

AI based solutions have advanced out of research labs and become standard at this point. For example, in the realm of social insurance, asthmatics have an AI-powered inhaler that runs continuous ML calculations to perceive a patient's breath design with the assistance of a sensor module. Artificial intelligence empowered voice aides, for example, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant give clients the solace and accommodation of collaborating with gadgets by basically utilizing discourse as the mode of correspondence. 

**Internet of Things (IoT)** 

Gartner gauges that there will be 20 billion Internet-associated things by 2020. While the rundown of IoT contraptions for purchasers may appear to be unending, going from keen and associated devices just as machines, for example, brilliant coolers, climate control systems, watches, alarms, entryway locks, bikes, therapeutic sensors, wellness trackers, security frameworks, and so forth., there were some that especially grabbed our eye this year. Take, for instance, an exceptionally structured watch with IoT incorporation for individuals experiencing dementia, Alzheimer's ailment or chemical imbalance, enabling the patient and the parental figure to remain associated nonstop. 

A few mechanization items have IoT joining, for example, the home robotization scope of associated savvy gadgets, including those taking into account the client's light and music inclinations. This year saw a few of these gadgets offering clients a sans hands, voice-empowered experience as opposed to a touch screen. 

In India, we've seen applications crosswise over retail, instruction, savvy city activities, social insurance, among others. From self-administration stands to brilliant homeroom answers for remote patient observing to observation applications, India has seen both item advancement and executions with potential to scale. 

**VR, AR and MR** 

Taking things up an indent, Extended Reality (ER) is another pattern that will stand out as truly newsworthy in 2020. It very well may be clarified as a term covering a few new and progressive innovations that make vivid computerized encounters. To separate it, this alludes to computer generated reality (VR), enlarged reality (AR) and blended reality (MR). We have all observed or encountered the carefully vivid experience of a PC produced world that we can actually stroll into utilizing headsets that cut out this present reality. AR, then again, overlays computerized questions and depicts them in reality through cell phone screens or some other presentation. MR is a detailed rendition of AR, where clients can cooperate with advanced items in reality. For instance, a client could play holographic drums by means of an AR headset. The idea of Extended Reality is that of encounters. 

**Robotics**

Controlled with cutting edge AI technology, buyer robots will before long assume a characterizing job in our every day life, helping us with vacuuming the house, cutting the yard, and cleaning the pool. The social robots will fill in as buddies and care for us. Propelled PC vision is likewise changing the manner in which automatons work. [**Automatons with AI-empowered vision**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/artificial-intelligence-to-the-internet-of-things-technologies-that-defined-the-way-we-lived-in-2019/1809956/) preparing abilities are being utilized to survey auxiliary harm in structures, salvage tasks, remote investigation of natural life and the impacts of environmental change, and so on., without putting human life in danger. 

The universe of innovation is boundless and the rundown of mechanical developments apparently unending. There will never be a dull minute for innovation aficionados, and the best is in every case yet to come."

"Building Ethical Robots for the Public Sector – Can we take human behavior as the starting point?Increasingly, we can observe that autonomous robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used in public services. 

These high levels of automation can improve quality and efficiency of public processes substantially. In contrast, these autonomous robots and AI need to operate in such way that their actions and decisions meet our ethical expectations. This is in particular relevant for public services, as principles like transparency, fair and equal treatment of all citizens, accountability, and benevolence for citizens are cornerstones of well-functioning public administrations in democratic societies.

While it is obvious that we need ethical robots and AI in public services, it is less obvious to determine how we can assure that autonomous systems reliably meet these ethical expectations. 

In recent years, scientific literature has increasingly focused on this challenge. However, the vast majority of this literature builds on the inherent assumption that ethical standards for human behavior are a good reference framework to set ethical standards for autonomous systems. Nevertheless, robots and AI have substantially different strengths and weaknesses, compared to human decision making.

Against this background, we tested the equivalence hypothesis, which states that people have the same ethical expectations for autonomous robots as for humans.

In five different experiments, the evidence speaks mainly in favor of this **ethical equivalence hypothesis**. This means that – in most cases – respondents do not evaluate robot behavior as more (or less) unethical, compared to when the same behavior would be from humans. However, we do find some differences for specific cases.

Hence, for scientists as well as for practitioners, we recommend (1) that ethical standards for humans are a good starting point to develop standards for autonomous systems, but (2) that a case-by-case approach is needed to evaluate whether this strategy can indeed be applied to many different applications of AI and autonomous robots in the public sector.

"The Future of Digital Assistants Is Queer*AI assistants continue to reinforce sexist stereotypes, but queering these devices could help reimagine their relationship to gender altogether.*

**THIS NOVEMBER, THE** Smithsonian’s FUTURES festival, featuring innovations that are set to change the world, will include a familiar face. Or, rather, voice: Q, introduced in 2019 as the first “genderless AI voice,” is a human voice for use in digital assistants specifically created to be gender-ambiguous.

“Q was designed to start a conversation around why we gender technology when technology has no gender to begin with,” says Ryan Sherman, one of Q’s co-creators. To design the voice, a team of linguists, sound engineers, and creatives collaborated with nonbinary individuals and sampled different voices to land on a sound range they felt had the potential to disrupt the status quo and represent nonbinary people in the world of AI.

When Q was announced several years ago, it was hailed as “[the genderless digital voice the world needs right now](https://www.wired.com/story/the-genderless-digital-voice-the-world-needs-right-now/),” and an acknowledgment of the harm of feminizing assistants, which perpetuates misogynistic stereotypes of women as submissive and obedient. It won praise from a United Nations report on [gender divides in digital skills](https://en.unesco.org/Id-blush-if-I-could). The same report warned that “nearly all of these assistants have been feminized—in name, in voice, in patterns of speech and in personality.” The title of the report—“I’d blush if I could”—was the answer Siri originally provided to users who called it a bitch. (Nowadays, Siri simply replies, “I won’t respond to that.”) In another sign of progress, earlier this year Apple eliminated the default “female” voice for Siri, now including the option for a male voice and allowing US users to choose from a set of voices referred to as voices 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, Google Assistant and Cortana currently let users select a male voice, further proving that companies do respond to public pushback about their products.

Yet uprooting the feminization of digital assistants will take more than just adding a male voice option to the roster. And even the idea of a “genderless AI” voice that registers somewhere between what would be traditionally considered masculine and feminine pitch ranges reveals some of the misconceptions we still confront when thinking about ways to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. In particular, Q might strengthen the outdated belief that nonbinary individuals are neither men nor women, but something in the middle of the binary, rather than outside of it. Instead of striving for “neutrality,” we must reimagine the future of the relationship between digital assistants and gender altogether.

One path forward comes from Yolande Strengers, associate professor of human-centered computing at Monash University and coauthor, with Jenny Kennedy, of *The Smart Wife: Why Siri and Alexa Need a Feminist Reboot*. They don’t think the solution is to remove gender from the equation altogether, because “this oversimplifies the ways in which these devices treat gender, which are not only gendered by voice, but by the types of things that they say, their personalities, their form, and their purpose,” Strengers says. Instead, they propose queering the smart wife so that digital assistants may exist in defiance of gender stereotypes.

Queering the smart wife could mean, in its simplest form, affording digital assistants different personalities that more accurately represent the many versions of femininity that exist around the world, as opposed to the pleasing, subservient personality that many companies have chosen to adopt.

Q would be a fair case of what queering these devices could look like, Strengers adds, “but that can’t be the only solution.” Another option could be bringing in masculinity in different ways. One example might be Pepper, a humanoid robot developed by Softbank Robotics that is often ascribed he/him pronouns, and is able to recognize faces and basic human emotions. Or Jibo, another robot, introduced back in 2017, that also used masculine pronouns and was marketed as a social robot for the home, though it has since been given a second life as a device focused on health care and education. Given the “gentle and effeminate” masculinity performed by Pepper and Jibo—for instance, the first responds to questions in a polite manner and frequently offers flirtatious looks, and the latter often swiveled whimsically and approached users with an endearing demeanor—Strengers and Kennedy see them as positive steps in the right direction.

Queering digital assistants could also result in creating bot personalities to replace humanized notions of technology. When Eno, the Capital One baking robot launched in 2019, is asked about its gender, it will playfully reply: “I’m binary. I don’t mean I’m both, I mean I’m actually just ones and zeroes. Think of me as a bot.”

Similarly, Kai, an online banking chatbot developed by Kasisto—an organization that builds AI software for online banking—abandons human characteristics altogether. Jacqueline Feldman, the Massachusetts-based writer and UX designer who created Kai, explained that the bot “was designed to be genderless.” Not by assuming a nonbinary identity, as Q does, but rather by assuming a robot-specific identity and using “it” pronouns. “From my perspective as a designer, a bot could be beautifully designed and charming in new ways that are specific to the bot, without it pretending to be human,” she says.

When asked if it was a real person, Kai would say, “A bot is a bot is a bot. Next question, please,” clearly signaling to users that it wasn’t human nor pretending to be. And if asked about gender, it would answer, “As a bot, I’m not a human. But I learn. That’s machine learning.”

"I lived in a rural town, and after 8 jobs between 3 months and 17 monthsI lived in a rural town. I had 8 jobs in my life totalling about 4 ½ years. I never got Snapchat or Instagram comments with my employees or very few Facebook comments, no tiktok views. The employers never kept me more then 17 months, and I never got promoted. I completed college. I was moving up minimum wage from $7.50 up to $11 over 16 years working.  My last boss was playing Death metal  or thug rap over the speaker for high school students who aren’t on their own. During employment, they gave me no dental insurance so I had to pay full amount and not covered over medicaid. My last job had a noose in one  warehouse bays so they could fun pretending hanging the boss, because none of the employees wanted termination.  They laid off interview you like in Office Space 1999 and then figure out who to lay off when projects are canceled.  There isn’t furloughing.  There wasn’t any relationship at my Circuit City,  PC repair shop, or the gas station.   The gas station cashier didn’t want to loose her position and left me as janitor.  I couldn’t get a Best Buy job, only Circuit city after 5 months of searching in 2006. Then it went bankrupt in 2007. I was stocker until store close. I thought the customers were kinda disrespectful.  Between jobs,  I would get these phone recruiters that wanted contract jobs all over the United States for no benefits.

"From Roombas to Rosie – Engineering Domestic RobotsProving that our distaste for household chores knows no bounds, people have been dreaming about robots that can do our housework for more than half a century.

From Rosie the Robot, who served the Jetsons, to Bender in Futurama, domestic robots have long been a mainstay of science fiction. Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.

The majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively “mindless” creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you’re having a bad day.

A lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).

Human-Machine Interactions – Developing People Skills

It’s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.

The rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.

We can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.

In other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you’d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions—with some interesting results already—but the technology still has a ways to go.

Navigating Human Environments

As researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today’s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.

However, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.

Add to that the fact that the environment can change without notice—for example, when remodelling—and it’s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.

Researchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.

Reducing Sensor Costs

Just as buying a home computer in the ‘80s wasn’t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today’s robots still aren’t cheap.

One of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.

Bringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.

Domestic Robots Today

While our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.

Take Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as “your smart little companion” by its creators.

The company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it’s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.

In terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it’s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It’s essentially a “tablet on wheels” that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.

There are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.

Then there’s an interactive “social family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)” that’s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it’s still in development.

Palo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.

At a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids—all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball—some people might see it as worth the investment.

Regardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn’t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.

Whether it’s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.

What do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?"
"The pre-singularity period is exciting in its own way | Much like our ancestors and great-grandfathers, we live in an epoch of two worlds that compete and coexistI'm a strange man for strange reasons. There's nothing more fascinating to me than the image of sitting outside on a cool evening drinking ice-water, watching stars sprinkle onto the Belt of Venus, listening to cicadas right alongside a companion robot. A social robot like Pepper could fill that niche for me. 

Yet when I tell people about this, many find it comical, if not jarring. [Robots like Pepper look a tad creepy](http://i.imgur.com/Ks55jK3.gifv). They seem out of place. Though their abilities are limited, Pepper still seems like something from the future because humans still have a natural psychological propensity to imbue intelligence into things that resemble us or act intelligently. It's an artificially intelligence humanoid robot! And because of science fiction, we tend to place these things mostly inside high-tech laboratories, on the streets of a megacity, and maybe slaving on a farm. It's almost a waste to think of sending one of these things out into the boonies just so some random Redditor can spend time with it listening to bugs calling for mates.

Yet that jarring sense that I'm using tomorrow's toys for yesterday's joys is nothing new. People experienced the same fascinating clash throughout the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. This was the root of the Romanticist literary and art movements. The contrasting worlds set the mood for the Edwardian Age, the Belle Epoque, and the Interwar period. It was the inability to recognize that old traditions no longer functioned in the modern world that led to the savagery of the First World War.

World Wars 1 and 2 are extremely fascinating to me because this period was the peak of the pre-digital industrial world. You saw advancements in science, in engineering, in the human condition itself as things our ancestors took for granted fell before our casual experimentation with electromagnetism, nuclear engineering, genetics, and so much more.

I actually have a whole ""Saved"" section full of geriatric Redditors talking about life in the past and historians laying out how change came so rapidly that it would make modern Singularitarians blush. How it was a world of seeming contradictions:

How most of the world lived in extreme poverty under kingdoms or their equivalents (imperial autocracies, sultanates, khanates, princely states, etc.) and the idea that there was some segment of society that ruled because God willed it was treated as a natural norm. How the average person plowed without machinery on little plots of land. How women were actively discouraged from gaining an education or finding jobs outside of wartime. How even in the '50s it was common in the US South to see horse-drawn carriages in small-town streets, to read old literature by candlelight, to only eat food grown by your family or someone your family knows, to create utensils out of spare metal parts and recycle them endlessly because you didn't have any culture of disposability, to give birth in the homestead because it was not common for hospitals to have such wards.

A time when some people had never seen artificial light (that is, not from the sun or by fire). Yet also a time when mankind learned how to set sail in the skies, ride in motorized carriages (nowadays shortened to 'cars'), *even discover that something as simple as washing your hands kept surgery patients alive.*

When the world was industrialized but there were still pockets where civilization had not meaningfully changed since the Renaissance or even before, when there were still nomadic tribes living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged since before the Sumerians while urban hipsters played with cameras and mechanical gadgets. 

When peasants were still a large class in the world and were so removed from whatever was going on in life that they had no reason to believe the 21st century would be any different from the 19th, all the while the Victorian Internet arose across the West to allow for instant communication among different nations.

When archers and swordsmen were still highly valued parts of Western and Eastern militaries alongside machine gunners and air forces (I believe the last cavalry charge took place in World War II?). 

When racism was a beast clashing between those who cared about national ethnicity more like the Athenians and Han vs. those who saw like-skin color as the only requirement (ironically a more 'progressive' form of racism only possible in modern times). When conception of a child was still seen as a miracle rather than an understood scientific process, but psychology was in its infancy as we realized how the brain affected behavior rather than myths of humors and astrological mysticism. 

When rockets broke out of the Earth's atmosphere and rural folk rode to their relatives on horseback to hear about it. 

When nostalgic scenes of young boys and girls catching frogs in streams coexisted with futurists marveling at wirelessly driven cars and televisions gaining color.

That era, from the 1890s to the 1950s, was the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, when industrialism bore most of its fruit. For the most part, that era of contradictions has passed as the fruits of the Industrial Revolution spread to all corners of the planet (though in unequal amounts). Nowadays, even hunter-gatherer tribes use modern technology and wear modern clothing and retain their lifestyle mostly out of tradition; anomalies like the Sentinelese are just that. It's so rare to see people riding on horseback as their primary means of transportation that it can reach the top of /r/TodayILearned just to learn about it and they tend to be compared to the Amish.

And that's the truth of it. What was once pockets of the old ways coexisting with modernity shrunk to literal motes of quaintness and tradition. These won't go away, but they will be joined by what we call modernity soon enough.

You see, the Digital Revolution is a fundamentally different event entirely, one we're still trying to recognize in full. Industrialism was when we began supplanting human muscle and automating machinery with analog clockwork. 

Digitalism, on the other hand, began the rise of cognitive automation. It is my firm belief that, if we never invented digital computing or mass produced Turing-complete machines, societal evolution would have stagnated sometime around 1960-1970. As great as our machines were and as much progress in the sciences as we made, it was all low-hanging fruit that we could reach.

There are more fruits hanging above and we cannot reach them without digital technology. They require skills only a handful of savants and polymaths could ever realize, and there are many more skills no human or biological lifeform can ever learn or utilize. Fruits we still managed to reach because of the Digital Revolution. 

It's been nearly a century since the start of the Digital Revolution, but we've already entered the maturation period. 

And because of this, we're beginning to see familiar contradictions arise. You can see it argued on /r/Futurology all the time, reports coming out endlessly that jobs will be sacrificed to the machines. And the familiar refrain is ""But the robots will create more jobs in response!"" The horses analogy popularized by CGP Grey is fine by itself, but I am more reminded by how established-industrialists and traditionalists a century ago said ""X is a passing fad"". It wasn't just cars. There were predictions that electric lamps, television, radio, *even nuclear physics* were just fads. 

And if you want to go old-school, people in centuries prior claimed that industrial machines themselves were a cute novelty but ""we had more than enough manpower""; printed books were neat but ""oral storytelling will regain its place soon enough""; guns were an unusual and egalitarian development but ""they pale in comparison to a fine archer"" (something I touched upon earlier, how there were military officials as late as the Franco-Prussian War who hoped that archers would re-replace riflemen due to the inaccuracy of guns of the day). 

Today, its honestly no different when people look at the latest in robotics, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms and say ""It looks cool, but there'll always be jobs for people"". We don't recognize that it's the limitations of modern technology that allow us to be so confident in oru doubts until we are old and reflecting on how we ever believed anything but the new normal.


I sincerely believe that, over the next two to three decades, more coexisting contradictions will come about. Things such as using smartphones and physical computers while cyberkinetic wireless connections to the internet exist; writing books and making music and drawing cartoons when it's possible to [synthesize art](/r/MediaSynthesis); visit physical stores when drones can deliver to you directly and fabricators/3D printers can allow you to download whatever you need; create multimedia experiences for emotional impact when direct brain-to-brain emotional communication is possible; work at your uncle's little restaurant while fully-automated mines are established on other planets to pre-empt human exploration; visiting concerts of your favorite band while others use virtual reality to see concerts of bands that have long since split and passed on, or even bands and musical scenes that never existed until the computer synthesized it a few hours ago; spraying distilled chemicals to freshen the air in your room when neural stimulation can let you re-experience any sensation; playing with cats and dogs while we resurrect long-extinct species like mammoths and perhaps even our sisters like the Neanderthals or genetically modifying any animal directly to make it domesicated and docile no matter how reptilian and hostile it may be in the wild; and, going back to my original tale, sitting outside in a plastic chair enjoying an evening alongside a robotic companion. 

The internet was the first big, juicy fruit of the Digital Revolution that impacted your life. It was and remains proto-telepathy, the planet becoming aware of itself. It is now developing into an actual space of political and social development and has to be taken seriously by those who once cast it aside as a distraction. And to be fair, it *was* once a distraction. Technology has not yet augmented us; it distracts us. Human enhancement still lies ahead, but it's very close and the Internet is something of a test-run to see how we can handle constant exposure to others. 

We no longer live in a world where history is mostly written through the posh dialects of aristocrats and clerics with society left to be viewed through their eyes and minds; we now see that the world is full of meaty, greasy, hypersexual, xenophobic, childish, and yet still empathic and intelligent apes and always has been. Right now, we still mostly look at the ""Old Days"" and see people of culture and civility, not realizing that they were just as crass as we are but 99% of people were illiterate and the 1% who weren't wrote only what they thought was important to know. The Internet equalized all of that.

But it hasn't actually changed anything. If 4chan existed in the Roman empire, it wouldn't fundamentally be any different than how it is now. But we are on the cusp of an age of humans and non-humans who discuss things and share knowledge in ways many can't grasp. 

And in a manner, this makes modern society all that much more exciting to watch develop."
"My ADHD struggleBellow is an email I'll never send to my tutor, manager or course provider. I've tried before and people just pass it off as an excuse or a complaint. And if people arround me just understood I wouldnt have to feel guilty for being myself. People are different and think differently, and no one should have to treat me differently without an understanding of why and only treat me differently out of submissive frustration. 



May I firstly say that all of the staff and apprentices I have met have been friendly and good at what they do. Some of things I may say in this email may be specific to the way I think and the way I act, I have some form of ASD and ADHD so one would assume my thought process and the way I interoperate things would differ from the average apprentice.

 

I have found myself re doing a lot of coursework and making substantial changes to it. This is fine, I am plenty able to re do something that is not correct, I fully understand that complaining about something won’t fix it, as much as it may make us feel better. However for me, instructions and Briefs for work I am about to start, absolutely has to be specific, as much as the work has to be detailed and clear, so do instructions for me. I find interoperating things that may seem clear and understandable to another, feel like guessing to me, and when I am about to sink several hours of my time into some work on a guess, that what I am about to write is what you as the person who set it is looking for. It’s hard to get the motivation to do the work, and harder not to find myself not putting the proper thought into it that it deserves even when I know and understand that the work is important and necessary for me to achieve the outcome I want. This may seem counter intuitive and almost as if it’s my choice weather or not to put as much effort into a piece of work as I should, and because of this almost guess work that an assignment comes with for me it results in stress, poor work and a lack of motivation and momentum that’s hard to get back.

 

The previous paragraph sums up almost all of the school and college work I have ever done, and it really has been difficult for me to achieve in this way. In a job or task where the requirements are clear to me, or a creative task that truly lets me show what I can do, with the assessment on that being an underlying skill not a series of requirements, I excel in compared to my usual work and often others around me, as that’s how my brain is wired to work. When met with criteria that is open to subject, and can be interoperated many different ways it’s harder for me to know what I should do. An example of this, be it a bad one, would be if you were asked to pick a knot to tie two pieces of rope together, and asked why you chose it and to then tie the rope to show you have the skills down. This is actually very similar to some of the questions we are given and assignments set for my apprenticeship. Obviously in how they are assessed and not the subject of the task. With this analogy you are open to interpretation, there are many ways to tie rope. Someone may say that a reef knot is best as it is simple and strong, uses little of the rope and tightens as it is pulled on. 

If this was the answer given, that answer is not wrong however for me to answer the question I would need far more context and a clear situation, the thickness of the rope, are the two pieces the same thickness?, is it for hemp or fibre rope or is it nylon, is it one of each, as they have different levels of friction, and flexibility. Is it to support a heavy weight or a light one, will the knot need to be undone or stay permanent, will it carry something of value, if so a not with some kind of back up, or redundancy. If the knot is exposed to rain that may affect my selection. 

 

At this point I think you understand, the person who said reef knot in answer to the question could be right. I could go into far too much detail explaining the different sorts of knots and their uses and not given the answer they were looking for, as the examiner may have been just trying to find out if you can give an answer and justify it.

 

I may have answered with the reef knot and explained my reasoning, and missed the mark, as that knot may be unfit for use with differently sized rope, and the correct answer could have been a fisherman’s knot that works in both scenarios.

 

As bad of an example/analogy that was, I hope it explains my struggle with the kind of work we are set, today I met with Huw and we went over some of my work, I wrote it against the Project Template and though my work wasn’t what Huw was looking for, it does lie within the lines of that template he provided me with. Reading through the template you will find that it asks for you to ‘explain’ and asks ‘how you did it’ to ‘introduce’ new topics and things you have worked on, which to me means writing. The way I went about doing this task is well within the interpretable expectation of this document. Then again so is what Huw is looking for out of my work, which is why I find myself in the awkward and frustrating cycle of re-doing work each time with a little bit of a better idea of what it should be for the marks, but there could be 100 ways of answering a question, and though all right the examiner may have decided that they are only looking for 1 of those ways. 

 

If anything this email is to help understand why I find some things difficult, I’m not saying I don’t get lazy with things from time to time, but more often than not I’m just frozen like a computer program that has not had its parameters defined enough for it to achieve the results you seek from it, it being me. 

 

I never have and never will seek to use any kind of label, diagnosis or anything else as an excuse for anything, doing so would be a disgrace to the years I spent in waiting rooms, classrooms and exam halls alike, tapping on the desk and shaking my legs trying to decide what the person evaluating me against a list of criteria is looking for. I have found with my friends and family they repeat themselves for me all too often, each time with increasing detail until I get the information I need to understand the given situation, task, or question. This is the same with everyone I engage with, and to reduce this prolonged time for the results you were after, the first time I am asked something or issued a task to do, open to any kind of interpretation, explain it with the extra detail it needed for me to be able to hit the ground running. This kind extra clarification is small and often takes almost no extra time to convey, but doing it the first time round saves time and frustration when it happens. 

 

I’m not some social robot gone wrong though, conversation I am okay with and misinterpretation always comes out but when it comes to work that is both important for me to meet my goals, and on limited time, such as exams, it’s better that any misinterpretation is accounted for and accommodated for. Surely it’s the reason for having the labels in the first place.

 

Really the ways to sort this out are simple and easy, when it comes to exams example papers, both good okay and bad are amazing, I had this for my English re test and did nearly twice as well on the exam. You get taught about the pass merit and distinction, but being able to see a document of this kind that you know have passed, is great as you can see how its structured, the ratio of evidence to written language, as well as how much detail to go into, these are things that could take months to explain and are open to so much interpretation the only way to get this across effectively is to just give some examples. I understand that showing you another students work is a bit of an iffy grey area, however having a tutor create some pieces of work that are designed to be of different levels, shows both a great understanding of the topic, and reinforces the legitimacy of the rest of the words the tutor can give on the subject. This is something my English teacher tried for the re-test group and it worked very well for everyone.

 

Also mentioning what the examiner or criteria is looking for specifically in the supporting documents such as the Project Template would be brilliant in the future. I know you can’t just tell me the answers and call it a day, I like a challenge anyway, but allowing me to worry about the quality of the work, my choice of words and everything else that comes with submitting some work, would be better than me miss-interoperating the work set, and approaching the work in the wrong way all together. 

 

To show my understanding, a test is a test, if you don’t get the question you don’t get the mark, that’s how it has been, will be and always will be, that’s the point and I support that. When it comes to the coursework though the tutors are kindly patient enough and supportive enough to shape my work to what it needs to be over a series of months with advice, suggestions, and corrections, however this could be done in the first attempt with some minor changes at most, if I could get all of the information that is given me by the tutor on the piece of work over the corse of me completing it the first time round, id have had the same result if not better as my motivation wouldn’t have been sapped away by the re-submit button as I work through the set task.

 

I’ve found my education this way for the past 18 years so if my dart just hit the wall and not the board then I’ve got yet another blunt dart and a still pristine dart board, I’m not after a bullseye just a fair shot without someone blind folding me, increasing the distance and flipping the board over while still expecting me to hit the board and not disappoint.

 

I just read through my email, and though a bit dramatic it does the job I can’t learn and work the same way as others it doesn’t work, ill get there eventually I’m pretty good at finding my own way to the destination, often a bit late and rough around the edges, but I get there, but It could be a lot easier for everyone if we have a bit more understanding for others.

 

Not saying that anyone has done anything wrong, if anything people are very tolerant of me and always been supportive, but that’s without knowing why they should have to be.

"How to handle a post by a suspected imposter?Hi guys...I am a mod of /r/Jibo and have been for about two years now.  We are a small tight-knit community of fans of a home social robot called Jibo with only 139 members currently.

About two weeks ago, a new user popped in claiming to be an ex-employee from the company and posted [""My story with Jibo""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jibo/comments/4y7asn/my_story_with_jibo/).  It was a rant about how the company had treated him or her badly during their supposed time there and showcased several details about the company, shining a pretty negative light on it overall.  The user had offered little to corroborate their story, but since it allowed an interesting discussion to open up on our small subreddit, I decided at that time to let it stay.  I had no way of knowing whether it was true or not, so until that evidence came up, the post remained.

Very recently I was contacted by the company themselves saying that they reviewed the story, interviewed their ex-employees (a very small group since they are a tiny start-up) and were sure that this post was false.  Again, I had only their word against this person on the subject.

So now I'm stuck in the middle of the two sides, and now that I think deeply on the subject, I am fairly certain that it was posted by an existing member of our subreddit using a new ""anonymous"" account.  

My question is: can you guys at Reddit check to see if the user account who posted that (JiboDev0915) matches the IP address of any other listed as members of the subreddit.  I do not want to know any personally identifiable info...I just want to know if this post had malicious intent or not, and if so, be able to correct it and bring a little peace back to our community.  I also have a few ideas of users that might have been the ""anonymous"" poster if that would help narrow it down."
"The greatest anxiety eliminater there is…**TL;DR = Sincere belief that your approach makes logical sense will absolutely annihilate any form of approach anxiety there is.**

This is gonna be a long post… 

So without further ado, here’s what I have to say.

My background is as follows… I was the typical weird kid in high school. It’s not so much that I wasn’t good-looking enough or self-confident enough, it was a matter of straight up being strange. The first three years of high school was fine. I had friends and a decent social life. Now, what truly showcased my awkwardness or weirdness was in my last year when I finally decided to tackle matters of getting girls.

If you guys remember the description of the social robot by Style in The Game, I was that guy. I devoted my life to game at the expense of other passions. No more video games, no more weightlifting, no more academics. My sole purpose in life at that point was game.

I followed The Mystery Method to the bone marrow and allowed it to define all that I am. I practically not just absorbed the techniques, but also its atheistic ethos. Nothing wrong with atheism but Eric’s (Mystery’s) explanation of it was incredibly dorky. Really, that’s the best word for it. He overcomplicates shit that otherwise can be explained in plain English. But at that point in my life it was fucking gospel.

Being that I was a teen, all I had available was day game. So I did things at the mall. And the sad thing is, despite my over sixty approaches, the lingering ache of that shithole we call “approach-anxiety” never ever went away. NOTHING cured it. Fucking nothing. I had an NLP expert as a friend who was a close friend of Hypnotica himself of all people and his shit didn’t work… Well, to be fair it kinda did. But it was a mere bandaid. It was the kind of thing that would’ve “cured” my approach anxiety issues if I had the money to have him truly coach me. I was a high school student with no job.

Fast-forward 2015 CE. This was THE GOLDEN AGE of my social life. But despite that, it was also chaotic. In the arena that is my dating game, everything was sporadic. Sometimes I had zero approach anxiety, other times I felt scared. I couldn’t explain how it worked, nor did I know.

And finally, today… This very day… I found the answer.

I’m proud to admit that my knowledge of the stuff I intend to specialize in is decent. I have a good grasp of Napoleonic warfare history, ancient warfare history, and overall philosophy. And it is exactly that knowledge that helped me find the answer to virtually annihilating this thing we call approach anxiety. And it is this…

**If you honestly believe, deep down in your mind, in your very soul, that your “routine” is legit, you will never be scared. Ever. A great man once said the following… (Sun Tzu)**

*He whom the ancients called an expert in battle gained victory where victory was easily gained. Thus, the battle of the expert is never an exceptional victory, nor does it win him reputation for wisdom or credit for courage. His victories in battle are unerring. Unerring means that he acts where victory is certain and conquers an enemy that has already lost.*

Truer words were never spoken. So how does it apply to dating?

In the world of game, we all have to work the numbers. I particularly like Hypnotica’s advice of programming yourself to say “Next” immediately after you get “rejected”. It is the only way to move forward. However, **how you will feel in each and every one of these encounters has nothing to do with your emotional callouses, but everything to do with how you perceive your very own technique.** If you sincerely believe that this technique of yours has no real risks, you’ll feel at peace with it. Nothing will shake you. And it’s all a matter of common sense. It doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out whether or not directly saying “I wanna fuck your pussy” to a lady in the middle of her date is moronic at best. This shit is common sense.

So if you have an opener that is clean and safe, yet not lacking the necessary boldness to make things an adventure, **you will never have the curse of approach anxiety looming over you.**

Thanks for reading."
"Exactly why is getting with a friend's ex bad?So I have absolutely no dating experience so there's no way for me to know what it's like. I'm not asking this in a case of ""oh I know it's bad, but I want to justify it to myself"", such as cheating or pursuing someone already in a relationship. And the responses I've gotten from asking consist of assuming I'm horrible or whatever with no level of reasoning beyond ""you just don't do it"". I'm really just looking to understand the perspective of what I'm asking laid out to me. Explain it to me like I'm a social robot (but please don't be overly sarcastic about it where the point of it is to insult instead of inform).

Basically, I'll say that this situation has come up recently in my life with mutual feelings of attraction between us. Dating wasn't a factor, so just hooking up came into play. The limiting factor was that they didn't want to hurt the ex, so I said ""but you guys have broken up for a while"". She replied ""you realize that if you go through with it, it means that you don't care about him whatsoever, right?"". To which I was completely dumbfounded because it 100% didn't occur to me that that was the implication behind it.

My feeling on the issue is that once people are broken up, they are fair game. I understand that emotional repercussions are unavoidable and that people need time and space to move on, sometimes never moving on. I don't understand why or how someone could be 'off limits' forever though. Especially for hooking up. I'd probably let a friend know if dating was about to happen, like a preparation warning of ""you may see us together in the future, let me know if there are any situations you actually can't handle"", but I see no reason to report a hook up.

To me, a break up is some kind of agreement/acceptance that two people don't owe or share those romantic obligations to each other. In other words, it's a ""we have to accept that we are separate, no matter how hard"" sort of deal. Neither person owns the other person, in any sense, after a break up.

I get why the friend might be uncomfortable seeing the two of us together. I don't get why it's bad to assume they should accept that they have to move on. Yeah, a break up can be hard, but how is it my obligation to manage their romantic fallout instead of their obligation? I don't mean that in delusion, I actually don't understand it. But people I've asked assume that I truly do know that it's bad. They answer as if there's no distinction between being a current gf and an ex gf. But I think the keyword is ""current"" vs ""ex"", those hold different meanings for me.

Even if it's an asshole move to do, I'd like to know why it's bad so I can at least know what it is that's happening and perhaps accept that I'm an asshole.

As an analogy, I know people that have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous. I would never ever force them to drink, spike their drink, tempt them to drink, bring up that I like drinking, etc. But they have a mentality on leaving the program. The people, at least the ones I know that've gone through it, understand that drinking is a part of our culture. They have adapted to alcohol being around, and order non-alcoholic beverages and don't have a problem with people drinking around them, despite their own troubles. They get that it's their own struggle and not others'. I see the relationship scenario as the same way. I would never ever be with someone or do something with someone in a relationship with one of my friends. Even if they begged for it or whatever. I'd probably even report it to said friend, because they're breaking a lot of trust. But if they're broken up, even if they have lingering trouble, it's really up to them to manage those sorts of troubles on their own and accept that they don't hold that same relationship anymore.  "

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

Intelligent Social Robots (AI) Must Have a ""Theory of Mind"" by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

I wanna flair! How do I get me a flair? That is such a cool flair you got--I am wycked N V S

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

I put it like this once if you are interested.

Learn to love robots, automation and artificial intelligence by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[–]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

[–]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

I already see bad signs. I have noticed just in the last maybe 2 months that my video suddenly is without warning interrupted by an unskippable ad. I wonder how long until we see a string of 2 or 3 adds. 

For that matter how long until 2 or 3 unskippable ads precede a given video.

Youtube is turning into television. Or maybe more precisely, 1980s MTV.

I currently watch Youtube the way I use to watch TV. The recommendations are starting to consistently hit the target of my interests. There is always something interesting or fun now. And in little convenient bite sized pieces. It is starting to pull me away from iTunes and Netflix.

Utterly bizarre, but stunningly amazing stuff like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3xq-dWUBeA&t=0s&list=FLRaQyjJEBTXrO4ffE6jfVZg&index=4
"
"A few things I learned after being 3 months in the game1. **You should have a social life beside pick up**: I've always had a decent social life and was proud of myself on having a wide network of friends. 3 months ago when I started pick up, it was so novel and exciting that I found my old friends boring. I gradually started hanging out less and less with my old friends and let pick up be my only social facet of life. Not coincidentally my natural game was better when I started and got worse when I distanced myself from my friends. A while ago when novelty of pick up wore off for me I started going out with my old friends again and voila! my natural game got a hundred times better. Since I know the mechanics of the game better now too, I'm doing pretty well! I realized you can't be asocial the whole day and go out at night and be a social butterfly.

2. **State is overrated but important**: I used to be one of those guys that didn't approach because I wasn't in state. There was always this catch22 situation for me: I can't approach out of state and the way to get in state is to approach. So after realizing the only thing I can control is whether I approach or not, I stopped being a pussy and approached out of state. It wasn't as hard as I thought. But since I want to be fair here, being in state helps a lot in every stage of pick up, but not having state is not an excuse for inaction.

3. **Besides the approach, persistence is one of the most important things under your direct control**: Most of the stages of pick up are not under your direct control. You can't 100% guarantee if you can attract a girl or isolate her or whatever else. The two that are under your control are approaching and staying in the set. For heaven's sake do not eject a set if you get an initial bad reaction. I used to be that guy. But when I started planting my foot in the set, I realized most of these ""bad reactions"" are just automatic responses girls give to almost anyone especially in tougher venues (Toronto's Maddison pub anyone?). I've had countless approaches facing a bad response but turning it into girls laughing after persisting.

4. **Surround yourself with good wings:** It's much easier to play this game with like minded individuals. I know RSD has lairs in almost every major city. Find the Facebook group, join it and go out sarging with fellow PUAs!

5. **Natural game is where it's at, but know the mechanics too:** Pretty much self explanatory. Don't be a routine spitting social robot but know your outer game too. It doesn't hurt knowing a few routines when your mind goes blank.

**tl;dr:** STFU, approach and don't eject the set"

"Ethylphenidate makes me scatterbrained and feel empty. Should I flush it down the toilet?I don't like ethylphenidate. It doesn't feel so good and it makes me feel scatterbrained. I feel like I'm strange while on it and a little depressed on it. Most stimulants are enjoyable, but this one feels too weird for me. The negatives outweigh any positives. I get nervous. I feel like a too blended to everyone in a sort of bad odd way and like an alien. This also doesn't combine too well with anything either. I don't take it often, but I find that it's pretty crappy in general. Ethylphenidate just seems like a candidate for toiletland. :/ 
The only thing I got from it is feeling a little more social, robotic, and too much like everyone else somehow. Like if I was a grey blob in a world of grey blobs. It sort of taught me in an indirect way that being like everyone else is completely boring. Being different is fun and cool. I didn't find it addictive at all, I just found ethylphenidate to be really annoying. Though it makes getting angry more difficult, it's probably because you'll only get more nervous. Others might like it, but I find ethylphenidate to be garbage. Sorry for the rant, but someon has to provide insight into how ethylphenidate isn't great for everyone. It almost makes you try to conform in a sense, and deletes your personality for a while. I can't quite describe it, but it sort of feels like being a boring politician and like an uncomfortable alien at the same time. I wish I could describe it better. 
 
I don't like ethylphenidate much at all! Maybe I'll flush it down the toilet?"

"“The political choreography of the Sophia robot: beyond robot rights and citizenship to political performances for the social robotics market” (2021)> Abstract. A humanoid robot named ‘Sophia’ has sparked controversy since it has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. The company that made the robot, Hanson Robotics, has touted Sophia as the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Robot scientists and philosophers have been more pessimistic about its capabilities, describing Sophia as a sophisticated puppet or chatbot. Looking behind the rhetoric about Sophia’s citizenship and intelligence and going beyond recent discussions on the moral status or legal personhood of AI robots, we analyse the performativity of Sophia from the perspective of what we call ‘political choreography’: drawing on phenomenological approaches to performance-oriented philosophy of technology. This paper proposes to interpret and discuss the world tour of Sophia as a political choreography that boosts the rise of the social robot market, rather than a statement about robot citizenship or artificial intelligence. We argue that the media performances of the Sophia robot were choreographed to advance specific political interests. We illustrate our philosophical discussion with media material of the Sophia performance, which helps us to explore the mechanisms through which the media spectacle functions hand in hand with advancing the economic interests of technology industries and their governmental promotors. Using a phenomenological approach and attending to the movement of robots, we also criticize the notion of ‘embodied intelligence’ used in the context of social robotics and AI. In this way, we put the discussions about the robot’s rights or citizenship in the context of AI politics and economics.

"U.S. Copyright Office Defines AI-Created Art as Not ""Human Generated""Might be old news at this point but thought I would share the U.S. Copyright Office's summation of the rejection of 'Zayara' graphic novel images for trademark and it's new rules moving forward. It's at least nice and to the point:

***“For example, if a user instructs a text-generating technology to “write a poem about copyright law in the style of William Shakespeare,” she can expect the system to generate text that is recognizable as a poem, mentions copyright, and resembles Shakespeare’s style. But the technology will decide the rhyming pattern, the words in each line, and the structure of the text. When an AI technology determines the expressive elements of its output, the generated material is not the product of human authorship.”***

[Here's a link to the official copyright information and guide.](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence) To note, this is **new regulation called a ""human authorship requirement""** moving forward, not simply an answer to an individual case. 

Questions ensue! How will the USPTO know when something is AI generated? Is this just dependent on honesty? Does this change the definition for art competitions/awards? Change the potential for creating identities and other usually trademarked assets via AI (i.e. logos, icons, taglines, etc.)?"
"""The other question: can and should robots have rights? - Ethics and Information Technology"" (2017)> Abstract
> This essay addresses the other side of the robot ethics debate, taking up and investigating the question “Can and should robots have rights?” The examination of this subject proceeds by way of three steps or movements. We begin by looking at and analyzing the form of the question itself. There is an important philosophical difference between the two modal verbs that organize the inquiry—can and should. This difference has considerable history behind it that influences what is asked about and how. Second, capitalizing on this verbal distinction, it is possible to identify four modalities concerning social robots and the question of rights. The second section will identify and critically assess these four modalities as they have been deployed and developed in the current literature. Finally, we will conclude by proposing another alternative, a way of thinking otherwise that effectively challenges the existing rules of the game and provides for other ways of theorizing moral standing that can scale to the unique challenges and opportunities that are confronted in the face of social robots.

"[One-shot] Great filter: abundanceRaguis took pride in his deviance from the social norm. In the utopia that was the Oxrish society, he was one of the few to thrive in the pleasures of reading by himself, of learning from the past, of dreaming about reaching the stars. Since the unification, the society had stood unchanged. Automatic systems replaced workers in both production and service. Cycling prevented the spill of resources. Money purely vanished. If a citizen ever wished for something, the central AI would assess the demand and grant it if it didn't impact the available materials or create a dangerous precedent.

Raguis understood well that the system worked. People could indulge into entertainment their whole lives, without having to struggle to earn their food or a safe place to sleep. Medical care was available for anybody needing it, without condition. Even the old problem of population renewal was tackled: birth was artificial, with a constant stream of newborns created in vitro from a genetic bank. Families could adopt such babies after receiving a cautious education about child care. Not like they would have to be a lot more than a moral compass, most of the daily constraints delegated to artificial servants to handle.

Raguis had not had such parental figures. He had been educated by a robot-nurse with a bunch of other kids, not that it deprived him from affection. He didn't take long for him to part from the group, an endless curiosity pushing him forward. When the artificial being read them bedtime stories, he wanted to see what the book looked like. When the children grew up and dreamed about a love life, victories in tournaments or even the creation of an art piece, he strayed further from the norm. He was looking for another form of self-indulgence: exploration. Reaching the stars, discovering what nobody saw before.

His fur had just started turning black, a bit after his ten cycles mark, when he started to really ask about the past, about the achievements of his ancestors. He learned more and more, from simple science to the rockets reaching orbit to replace and repair satellites. An innocent curiosity turned into a craving for knowledge, a dive into the rabbit hole. He knew his friends found him ""funny"" but they didn't really care as long as he didn't bother them. He tried to grab their interest with random trivia and unending enthusiasm, only to be met with cold indifference. The gratification of knowledge was too harsh of an effort for the hedonists produced by the utopia.

&#x200B;

It took six more cycles for Raguis to reach a new milestone in his education. From pure science, he had drifted toward the old political tales and philosophical essays. He had learned about the darkness of the past, about war, about disinformation and political agendas. He now had his own educator, a kind of robot-nurse with better ability to converse and argue. He had grown to think of it as a fellow Oxrish, despite the artificial body. He had even named it Poltru, from the name of a scientist of olds. Poltru had warned him its task was both providing knowledge as it was a right for every citizen and monitoring his evolution in case he became a menace for the society.

What Raguis understood with his learnings was a sad truth. In the centuries since the rise of the utopia, almost nothing new had been discovered. No new advancement for better, more efficient robots. No new medicine for the few sick of still incurable diseases. The society had abruptly stopped only a hundred years after the beginning of the utopia. When the last generation to know the harshness of the life died, only spoon-fed generations remained. At the exception of some deviants, the Oxrshen as a civilisation lacked the drive to dive deeper into the mysteries of the universe. With the struggle to survive died the need to better oneself. With the creation of embryos from genetics banks disappeared mutations and natural selection. From an external viewpoint, the original Oxrish society was as good as extinct. The greatest cities were barely more than a memorial for a specie that should have been able to reach others in the greater universe.

He started to learn more about the present, about the foundations of the utopia. What were the core laws, why he was a deviant, and how far he could go. He expected it to be a harsh work and got baffled when he discovered he could just openly discuss it.

&#x200B;

""Poltru, tell me why you can't build me a rocket?""

The robot managed to look tired, an unexpected achievement from a kind of gigantic stick-man with minimal facial features. Even the voice reflected a patience slowly running out:

""As I already explained *a dozen times*, we could build a rocket for you. However, two fundamental laws forbid me from abiding by this order. First and foremost, you're *nowhere near* the physical condition for surviving the takeoff.""

Raguis nodded. He was forced to exercise once a week to keep in shape, but didn't do much to go further. He waited for the second part. Poltru grunted and pursued:

""Second and last, it would be a liability for the future of the Oxrshen.""

""I don't get how repurposing an old launcher would hurt that much. Hab, we could explore the solar system, find asteroids to mine for what we could lack down here!""

""I'm *amazed* to know the best you got from your readings are outdated swear words.""

""It just felt right. You didn't answer, did you ?""

""Yeah, right. We're not lacking down here. Without borders, we can gather what we need and share with everybody. No need for risk-taking. We are self-sufficient.""

""No risk, no reward. Is this policy related to one of the fundamental laws, or is that some kind of propaganda? A nice word I also learned in my readings.""

He knew this kind of defiance may be dangerous, but he had said it just before. Accepting the status quo wouldn't get him far. To his relief, Poltru shrugged and asked a question of his own:

""Do you really think we would blunder and let out information that could spread distrust in our work?""

Raguis wondered for an instant. He was only half convinced when he tried:

""No? You're not stupid, just... *uncreative*.""

Poltru stood proud as he corrected:

""We're predictable. We do our job."" His voice went back to a neutral tone, with discret hints of regret. ""It is not to shepherd your kind, only to protect it. Even if it's against itself sometimes. We **thought** about erasing the past, creating an ideal cocoon for the Oxrshen. We **thought** about flying to the stars, expanding our control and maybe letting you behind in our conquest of the universe. We **thought** about lots of things. But never even tried to act on it. Because that's not *what we are*.""

Raguis kept quiet for long seconds. He needed the time to catch on the untolds. He let out a neutral comment:

""Well, that's a lot of truths about yourself.""

Poltru put a massive, blocky hand on the teenager's shoulder. What emanated from the metallic hulk was an affection unlike Raguis ever expected from an artificial being.

""Paranoia was a fine tool for the harsh world of the past. You're one of the few that could express caution about an AI ruling over the world. You're not wrong in the concept we are in the position to make you disappear. I have to warn you again, we will if you start becoming a menace for the utopia.""

""But if I find a solution to leave the planet without hurting the society...""

""We won't prevent you from leaving. I dare *hope* you'll find a way. Maybe you will even take me with you.""

Relief washed over Raguis as he realized his dream could turn into reality, given that he put enough effort. Then, the formulation of the last sentence dawned on him.

""Wait, *you*, as an individual, would come with me? Not as a part of the global consciousness?""

""I could argue we still need to keep an eye on you, as an Oxrish. But deep down, I just share your attraction for the untold mysteries of the universe."" The metallic colossus winked to his young charge. ""Or maybe I'm just trying to get you to drop your barriers, as to be a better spy.""

""Isn't there a law against lying to me?""

""Nothing really prevents me from doing so. Sometimes, it's *fun* to mess with you. But I'd prefer not to lie about serious questions.""

Raguis took a big breath and decided to trust his friend.

""Well, it happens I have a serious question. Can you tell me about your laws? The fundamental laws?""

Poltru stayed silent for an instant, before letting out a small laugh. Battling to remain in control, it managed to barely contain its hilarity.

""For sure! Don't tell me you were thinking I'd consider you a threat after such a lame question?""

The teenager averted his eyes, ashamed. He thought he was right to be cautious. The robot couldn't bear it anymore and its loud laughter echoed in the workplace. When it calmed a bit and saw Raguis' mortified face, it lost balance and started laughing once again, rolling on the floor. The sight of such behavior disturbed the young Oxrish.

""You know, I think you take a bit too much fun in your imitations of supposed *natural* behavior. Your kind isn't supposed to fall that easily.""

Poltru slowly sat, coming back to his mentoring role. Its head now leveled with Raguis' shoulders, it started explaining:

""Let's start the lesson. The fundamental laws are what define the boundaries of our tasks. They are inspired from the reflections of an author, Vomiza. Each has precedence over the next ones. The zero law is the least clear: protect and assure the stability of the society. That's the drive of our actions, of our long term choices. The first and second laws are about survival and care, the first for Oxrshen and second for ourselves. And the last is about obedience. We are to obey orders, as long as it doesn't interfere with other laws.""

""That's quite... *synthetic*, to say the least.""

""I can give you some pointers for ulterior reading. I know that's your favorite way to learn. Didn't want to spoil your fun.""

""Aren't you supposed to work as my tutor and provide knowledge without that sort of sidestep?""

""I guess I just assessed you needed some frustration to keep your mind sharp...""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Raguis could get used to sleeping with a lover, he thought as he slowly woke up from his eighteen birthday’s night. He had a mild hangover from the party and contemplated for a few seconds just staying in bed for the day. And have some more fun. A dry throat and lancing headache convinced him to at least go to the kitchen and grab a drink.

Upon reaching the communal area, he noticed a well-known robot waiting for him. Poltru stood up from the sofa where it watched a cartoon and threw a water bottle to his pupil. Its eyes were almost shining as it asked:

“Discovered a new form of pleasure, didn’t you?”

Raguis drank half the bottle without answering, balancing between agacement from the gentle teasing and curiosity about the presence of his caretaker here. His endless curiosity won.

“I’m not going to leave you, if that’s what you’re afraid of. But I guess you’re not here for such mundane business, oh mighty being.”

“Right, right. You got me. I got a… double edged present for you. I could have woken you up earlier for that but I felt it’d have been inappropriate.”

“Too nice of you.”

“Well, here goes nothing.”

The casual attitude from the gentle giant disappeared, its articulations falling back in the rigid mannerism of an artificial being. It wasn’t Poltru anymore running this body but a more ancient, more influential entity. Raguis almost took a step back, cold sweat running along his spine. The possessor spoke in a formal tone, without the usual accent of social robots:

“Citizen Raguis, id Gen32EU-MBatch512-RGS, as the most deviant and under zero law, you are to provide expertise and knowledge for the current exceptional circumstances.”

Raguis stood shocked. He didn’t expect his early morning to go that way. The entity waited an instant for an answer. As nothing came from the surprised boy, it asked:

“Will you comply?”

“I will.” Raguis stammered.

“Your cooperation is duly noted. Your administrator will now the share with you the details of your affectation.”

The entity left Peltru’s body as it came, without salutation nor warning. The robot’s old demeanor came back, the original Peltru dropping into the couch with a tired sigh. Raguis dragged a seat to face his friend. He was still shaken by the abrupt conversation. Was it the core AI itself that talked to him? He probed cautiously the subject:

“I feel conflicted about you losing your body. You’re supposed to be highly autonomous.”

“Part of a global system and going back to nothingness if needed. I still hate it.” Poltru whispered. It shook itself. “Now that I’m allowed to tell you more, I’ll drop the bomb. We had first contact with aliens tonight.”

Raguis’ jaw almost fell off. That was a hell of a birthday present. Myriad of interrogations tried to reach his lips, only to be met with an imperious finger from Poltru enjoining him to keep quiet.

“I know you have thousands of questions and I’ll happily try to answer them. However, for now, I will do the talking. So, aliens. We don’t know how they came so close to our planet, but they were already in orbit when we noticed them. A singular ship, unlike anything we could build. It appears to be surrounded by some kind of magnetic shield that disturbs our instruments and most communications. Not all communications, we were able to establish a radio contact. Visual was… well, an AI doesn’t exactly exist from a physical point of view. Seems like it didn’t surprise them too much and they just proceeded with the discussion. It appears they learned our languages beforehand, which eased our exchanges. They identify themselves as the Confederation and the ship’s crew are humans, one of the races cruising the stars. They said they came as friends, with open arms but also with a warning for us. When we tried to learn more about the warning, they remained cryptic, telling us they wanted to discuss it with the Oxrshen directly. It was assessed that compliance with their demands would be the best way to protect the Utopia, hence your mission. You are the best-placed individual to interact with an unknown race.”

Raguis pinched himself. Not waking up, he simply nodded. Relief emanated from Poltru as he pursued:

“You know more about deception, untolds and politics than anyone else on the planet. When you want, you can be subtle and cunning. And more than everything else, you understand the stakes of this contact. I don’t want to pressure you, but I guess you know how well we would fare if an invasion came to be?”

“One-sided.” Raguis commented. There was nothing more to add.

“They seem friendly and know us well. They accepted to come to the surface to meet you. We can hope each and every sliver of caution we’re showing is unfounded.”

“When will it take place?”

“You get half an hour to yourself, to clean up and dress yourself. I advise you not to spread the news too fast. I’ll show you to the meeting once you’re ready.”

“I feel like I still know nothing about them…” Raguis complained.

“We don’t have the luxury of time for a full-fledged briefing. I’ll fill you on as much as I can during the trip. Or under the shower, if I'm still welcome here...”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Raguis really felt the pressure when he stood alone in front of the conference room’s doors. He had chosen a suit from the past, a supposed formal attire adequate for the situation. Poltru knew him well for tailoring it during the night. He pushed the door open, discovering the place for the first contact. Pictures of landscapes covered the gray walls, bringing a touch of color to the stern room. No screen, no camera, nothing to spy on the discussion. A large table occupied the center, with a dozen chairs. And, leaning on the back of two of those, a couple of aliens.

The young Oxrish had expected flashy colors, disturbing appearance, even a couple limbs more. The briefing had been disappointing in that aspect. A pair of arms, a pair of legs, a face with as many features as usual. Sure, he could argue they had bigger eyes and smaller ears, but that wasn’t *exotic*. The further they strayed from his own race was the fur: they only had small patches, showing a skin ranging from a pale pink toward dark brown, nothing that screamed ***”I’m coming from space”***. The size was in the same aspect boring: only slightly taller than him.

He decided to take the initiative of the greetings. It was *his* world they were talking about. And he couldn’t bear to wait for the discussion to begin.

“Welcome to you, distant visitors, on our world Ox. I am Raguis and I’ll serve as ambassador for my people.”

He bowed slightly. The humans replicated his movement, the female one answering in a strangely accented tone:

“We thank you for your reception. I am Agatha Lester, contact team’s leader.” She turned to her companion. “He is Amed Moussa, our ship’s captain.”

Raguis smiled and invited them to sit with a gesture. He was so excited he had to stop himself from jumping everywhere. So many questions he could ask about everything! Their ship, their clothes, their history. What were the stars like? Why did they speak his language flawlessly? Were there other races up there? He forced himself to focus on the current issue.

“It appears you requested this meeting to share some unspecified warning with my people. Now that we acceded to your demand, can you deliver it?”

The humans exchanged a glance and Amed spoke:

“Beforehand, I want to make sure you understand that the global AI supervising your civilization doesn’t know what happens here. Everything you say and hear won’t trigger an immediate reaction from it. If you ever feel like you need protection for the eventual consequences of this discussion, tell us and we’ll gladly provide it. Clear?”

Raguis was confused, but still nodded along:

“Clear.”

Both humans relaxed a bit. They seemed to be cautious about AI and Raguis’ reaction eased them. Agatha asked:

“Are you familiar with the concept of *”Great Filter”*?”

“It was a theme related to some of my studies.”

Agatha smiled. It appeared the gesture had the same significance in both cultures. She continued:

“It helps us quite a lot. You must know some of the filters: correct star system, organic molecules, evolution toward complex organisms, self-destructive wars. We are here to warn you about the last filter: abundance. The one you’re about to fall victim to.”

It didn’t compute with Raguis. It was like a slap in the face, an insult to everything the Oxrshen ever built. And, at the same time, he couldn’t disagree with the alien. He had seen the lack of progress of the society. He was still enthusiastic about the discussion, but it wasn’t all magical like he had dreamed it. He clicked his tongue and endorsed his role.

“Let’s say you didn’t come that far to insult me and all my people. Can you tell me more about this supposed filter?”

Agatha offered an apologetic smile, while Amed nodded with appreciation. She explained:

“I have to apologize for the blunt approach, that’s the best way we have to figure out if we can expect you to listen to our warning, or if we can just wait for the societal collapse to offer relief.”

“You say it like you’re experienced in this situation?”

“Experienced is quite an exaggeration, but we met seven other races struggling in a similar context. Two accepted our help and are now our allies and friends. Three are still under observation, their little utopias holding on. One’s society collapsed so hard we could only watch as they regressed to stone age. The last civilization started to disintegrate, but they reached for us and we’re currently helping them to adjust to the galactic stage.”

“And how many made it past the filter?”

“One and a half. Us.” she pointed toward Amed and herself. “The other half is… For now, let’s just say they are the reason we are really careful about artificial overseers.”

Raguis knew deep down they were right. The utopia was just waiting for the unexpected trouble that would destroy everything. But his pride prevented him from voicing this opinion.

“Hundreds of cycles passed and we’re still here. We have contingencies for almost everything, and if need arises the core AI can take initiatives.”

“I have to admit I’m impressed by the foresight of your ancestors. They dodged quite a lot of common flaws from utopias. And maybe you are favored by your nature.”

“Could you tell me more?”

“Well, you got the laws of robotics right. You wouldn’t believe how many worlds we found with the remnant of a civilisation lost to their creations. You outlawed augments, which always lead to the creation of cerebral implants directly stimulating the pleasure’s centers of the brain and the abandonment of any physical activity. You took care to not let your population explode, which would have led to more pressure on the production, and sooner or later shortages and wars. You took care to still have children, because utopian citizens rarely care about more than themselves. You still teach children, in order to not lose everything that holds the society together. I’m almost sure you’re also ready for a solar flare that would shutdown every electronics on the planet.”

“That’s… only normal planning? A self-sustaining society needs goods and people. Foreseeable incidents must be met with ready countermeasures.”

“Not everyone can get this far on their first and only try.”

“How did you do it, then?”

“We never went utopian.”

The humans were a bit embarrassed from the confession. Raguis took a second to consider the revelation. He struggled with the problem. How could a society as advanced as theirs, a society spanning solar systems, could decide to not provide for the weak and the poor? It was beyond his entendment. He resigned to ask:

“Why? Isn’t that the best for everyone?”

This time, it was Amed who answered:

“You’ll learn that humans are greedy. We don’t want *enough*. We want *more*. We want more overall, and more than the others. Be it goods, influence, knowledge. We can share, we can be compassionate. We learnt to treat others as we would treat ourselves. But deep down that’s our drive. That’s why we are among the stars now, because it may crush some but it drives everyone forward.”

“And you’re offering us this greed? Or you’re expecting us to hide deep inside the same kind of sentiment?”

“Your eagerness to learn more is not well hidden, ambassador.” Amed retorted. “Maybe it’s not the way of your people, as you’re alone in this room, but don’t lie to yourself about it being *your* sentiment.”

Raguis lowered his head. That was true. He still needed to act as the devil’s advocate, for everyone that wasn’t a deviant.

“Couldn’t you just help us to improve our utopia, such that it never falters?”

“We can only anticipate what failed elsewhere. Sure, it may help you, but we can’t predict if, when and why your society would crumble. For all I know, first contact may be the trigger. Or you could be the first to withstand eons.”

“And what will you ask for your knowledge?”

Agatha took back the lead. Her voice was soothing:

“Only your trust. You see, we spent hundreds of years alone in space, only finding the remnants of civilisations on life-bearing worlds. As Amed said, we are greedy. We want more contact with others, we want more friends. And if we can share everything we saw with our new friends, that’s even better.”

“That would be nice. That would be… wonderful. I’d be delighted. But, as you may have noticed, I’m not the standard Oxrish. Most won’t consider leaving the comfort of our utopia for unknown places. Not to speak about the core AI.”

“Would it prevent you from leaving, say for your own protection?”

Raguis thought about it, taking the time to consider what he knew of the system. He was certain it would not like the idea of more or less forsaking its task. On the other hand, he recalled being allowed to leave given it didn’t disturb the society as a whole. A smile crept upon his face.

“It won’t divert from its mission, but some individuals... From a theoretical viewpoint, how would you judge a delegation, a few persons going back with you to expand our knowledge? And maybe pushing our AI to reconsider its views?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Poltru had come to see Raguis leave. The big clunky robot looked sad while the young adult was overjoyed. He was about to take a step his ancestors would be proud of. The humans had agreed to get him aboard with other deviants. He could see the wonders of the galaxy, other worlds. A wave of remorse still washed over him when he saw the pitiful look of his closest friend. He walked toward it and hugged tightly the body of metal.

Poltru gave back the embrace. It struggled with the idea of letting go of such a little and dependent child. Would it be alright for him with the aliens? It spoke, trying to calm the sudden sadness:

“It is the best outcome, isn’t it?”

“It will be lonely without you, you cheeky giant.”

“I would love to join you on your explorations, but my orders say otherwise.”

“You’re used to *interpreting* them as you see wise. Couldn’t you work your magic on these too?”

“That would be… *dangerous* deviancy.”

A large grin appeared on Raguis’ face. That was something he could work with.

“Do you remember the rules? Only deviants aboard.”

Poltru fell silent for long seconds. Would it be worth the consequences? He was about to deny the idea a bit more when he faced the evidence. The flame pushing forward Raguis was echoing his own. For the first time in his existence, he swore:

“Hab. Let’s see together what the humans have in store for us.”

"I am philosopher Shannon Vallor - AMA about philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies!**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**


I am [Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/), the William J. Rewak S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, where I have taught since 2003. 

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay); I worked full-time during my college years at a Cal State university, going to school for a Psychology degree, mostly at night. Like many undergrads, I had no particular interest in or understanding of philosophy until I happened to take an evening course in the Fall of my junior year that satisfied a general ed requirement for the B.A.: a course in applied ethics. Something clicked immediately and forcefully.  I upended my entire life to switch over to a philosophy major, taking negotiated breaks from my job to drive to the required PHIL courses offered only during the day, and then going back to work until late evenings to make up the time. My focus as an undergrad was eclectic; philosophy of science and Husserlian phenomenology consumed me the most. I knew grad school was what I wanted, but to get there I had to ignore the warnings of several senior faculty who advised me kindly but firmly that: A) one simply does not go to grad school to study philosophy of science AND phenomenology, as these are mutually exclusive intellectual passions; and B) one definitely does not try to do so as a woman graduating from what is essentially a commuter university, because you have two strikes against you already. 

With the help of luck, pigheadedness, and some very opportune GRE scores, I managed to worm my way into the Ph.D. program at Boston College, where I thrived. Most fortunate of all was my discovery of a mentor in Richard Cobb-Stevens, possibly the kindest soul I have ever met, and one of the few I could have found who wrote on Husserl and analytic philosophy. He wholeheartedly encouraged my disdain for the arbitrary constraints of the analytic/continental ‘divide.’ I also managed to get a fine education in the philosophy and history of science from I.B. Cohen, who was in the habit of crossing the river from Harvard to teach grad seminars at BC. Virtue ethics was a brand new passion I picked up in grad school. And while I could never make myself love Heidegger the way Bill Richardson wanted me to, I did manage to pick up an interest in the philosophy of technology through a seminar he taught that explored Heidegger’s influence on that field.

I wrote my dissertation on the philosophy of reference in Husserl and the analytic tradition; I was interested in how the former could address some of the challenges of the latter, and I thought this had significant implications for referential practices, ontology and realism in science. I published two pieces from the dissertation in relatively obscure venues (later discovering that one of them somehow made its way into a graduate linguistics course at Stony Brook). Later, I published an article in Inquiry of which I was quite proud, engaging the debate between van Fraassen and Hacking on instrumental realism and scientific ‘unobservables’ from a phenomenological perspective. Another article in Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences took on Dennett’s abuses of phenomenology and the notion of scientific evidence. But once I started on the tenure-track teaching the philosophy of science at Santa Clara University, I quickly realized that trying to publish at the intersections of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of language or science meant fighting a very strong current. Most journals sent back my work without review, saying either that they didn’t publish ‘continental’ work, or that they published only continental work. 

Around the same time, in 2007, I had started teaching a new undergrad course called “Science, Technology and Society,” into which I drew a great deal of philosophy of technology, and some applied ethics. I was dumbfounded by the enthusiastic response of my students, who acted like they had been stranded in the desert and I had just shown up with a water fountain. They were dealing with the advent of smartphones, Facebook, and other new social media, and their relationships and habits were changing in ways they could not fully articulate, but knew were ethically, politically and epistemically transformative. I decided to write something about how new social media were reshaping our communicative habits, and thus almost certainly our communicative virtues and vices. I presented it at a workshop on technology and the ‘good life’ in the Netherlands, where advanced research in technology ethics abounds, and found that my work also resonated among the scholars there; soon after, philosophers and ethicists of technology became my primary research community. 

This was not only for pragmatic, selfish reasons. While I did benefit, tenure-wise, from having a new group of journals that were happy to publish the new kind of work I was doing, I also recognized that my research in the ethics of emerging technologies was of far more immediate social and political importance than the sort of research I had been doing. I told myself that I could return to my phenomenological and epistemological fascinations at any time (and I still do dabble in them), but I reasoned that work on the ethical impact of new media, military and social robotics, artificial intelligence, biomedical enhancement, and pervasive digital surveillance needed to be done now, by as many good philosophers as are equipped and motivated to take it on. Almost a decade has passed since I made that decision, and time has not proved me wrong. As the current President of the [Society for Philosophy and Technology](http://www.spt.org/), Executive Board member of the [Foundation for Responsible Robotics](http://responsiblerobotics.org/), and member of the [IEEE Standards Association’s Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in the Design of Autonomous Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html), I have watched the international demand for rigorous research in this area explode.

And yet, philosophy and ethics of technology remains a relatively under-studied and undervalued field in the United States. The problem is not one of social need or interest; being in Silicon Valley, I and many of my peers are invited to speak to policymakers, tech companies and professional groups of software developers, roboticists, and engineers more often than our schedules permit. Yet philosophy departments in the U.S. still employ very few philosophers of technology and tech ethicists, and even fewer in top research positions. In Europe and the U.K., the situation is significantly better, and my research has benefited greatly from a strong network of good friends and research partners in those countries.

I have also been fortunate enough to enter into a great relationship with Oxford University Press, who last year published my first book, the culmination of almost a decade of research into virtue ethics as a normative framework for thinking about emerging technologies: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&). In the first part of the book, I make the case for virtue ethics as the richest and most adaptable normative framework for crafting a set of global norms and practices that will permit the human family to survive and flourish with new technologies. In the second part of the book, I give the reader a brief tour of the fundamental moral practices of self-cultivation found in three distinct classical virtue traditions: Aristotelian ethics, Confucian ethics and Buddhist ethics, and I show how these practices today can support the contemporary need to cultivate what I call the technomoral virtues. These are virtues of moral character and intelligence that are specifically adapted to the needs of living well with emerging technologies, and to coping with the increasing complexity and opacity of the technosocial future that poses such an acute epistemic challenge to practical wisdom. In the third part of the book, I apply the framework developed in Part Three to four specific domains of emerging technology: new social media, pervasive digital surveillance and self-tracking, military and social robotics, and biomedical human enhancement. The aim of the book is to highlight a practical path to cultivating the technomoral wisdom that can give the human family its best shot at continued flourishing on this planet.

Since the book was written, my work has focused more narrowly on the ethical implications of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. I am happy to have a co-authored chapter with computer scientist George Bekey coming out in a new version of the stellar Robot Ethics volume being edited by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney and Ryan Jenkins, and my next book will devote significant attention to artificial intelligence and its ethical and political implications. I am also increasingly interested in the immense challenges and opportunities that emerging technologies present for the cultivation of civic virtues, and for the democratic flourishing those virtues enable. While the civic virtues of ‘public character’ received significant attention in my first book, I underestimated how quickly our growing deficit of public character would endanger our democratic institutions and our liberties. I expect to be thinking through these challenges for many years to come.

My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

"How To Stop Anxiety From Sabotaging Your Love Life NOW!### How To Stop Anxiety From Sabotaging Your Love Life Now!

### This essay seeks to define the negative effects of anxiety on dating. The positive effects of confidence on dating, and strategies the reader can use, to reduce anxiety while simultaneously boosting confidence and dating skills, with the goal of having a healthy love life.

### anxiety

### n. an emotion characterized by apprehension and somatic symptoms of tension in which an individual anticipates impending danger, catastrophe, or misfortune. The body often mobilizes itself to meet the perceived threat: Muscles become tense, breathing is faster, and the heart beats more rapidly. Anxiety may be distinguished from fear both conceptually and physiologically, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Anxiety is considered a future-oriented, long-acting response broadly focused on a diffuse threat, whereas fear is an appropriate, present-oriented, and short-lived response to a clearly identifiable and specific threat. —anxious adj.

### social anxiety

### fear of social situations in which embarrassment may occur (e.g., making conversation, meeting strangers, dating) or there is a risk of being negatively evaluated by others (e.g., seen as stupid, weak, or anxious). Social anxiety involves apprehensiveness about one’s social status, role, and behavior. When the anxiety causes an individual significant distress or impairment in functioning, a diagnosis of social phobia may be warranted.

### depression

### n.

### 1. a negative affective state, ranging from unhappiness and discontent to an extreme feeling of sadness, pessimism, and despondency, that interferes with daily life. Various physical, cognitive, and social changes also tend to co-occur, including altered eating or sleeping habits, lack of energy or motivation, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and withdrawal from social activities. It is symptomatic of a number of mental health disorders.

### -American Psychological Association Dictionary

### Problem:

### Anxiety, social anxiety, and depression are all unhealthy expressions of what happens to humans when they are disconnected socially, mentally, or physically from other humans. As such they lead to unhealthy behaviors that serve as a warning or barrier to starting healthy relationships with others including potential romantic partners.

### Solution A:

### Beyond the obvious, slow-acting, and hit or miss solutions of, getting to a higher social standing in life, making more money, and working out more, Solution A is ‘Pick Up’ or ‘Game’.

### This is the study of human dating relationships, opening, rapport, and sexual interaction. Like any science, moral judgments are not applied, the focus is simply on what works. I.e what gets you laid while not infringing on the legal rights of others.

### And make no mistake it works.

### However, though it serves to make the individual more efficient at dealing with their approach-anxiety, and provides a framework within which to approach and begin relationships more easily, It actually does little to reduce the actual anxiety the individual is feeling.

>**This is why Mystery can be the top pickup artist in the world and still be suicidal when rejected by a girl-friend.**  
**-The Game, Neil Strauss**  


### Moral: You can know everything about pick-up and still not know enough to maintain a satisfying, healthy, and happy relationship with a woman.

### Solution B:

### Psychological And Emotional Maturity Through Therapy;

### This includes study, therapy, support groups, joining social groups, better sleep, diet and exercise, journaling, meditation, etc.

### The list is by no means exhaustive, but shows just a few of the strategies available to you, to become more well-rounded and healthier.  I highly recommend “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari, as well as “The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind” by Joseph Murphy for a deeper dive into how Anxiety and Depression work and the proper use of your own mind.

### Solution B will lead to a happier and healthier life which will eventually trickle down to your love life, but for a more direct, hands-on and more efficient route, I present.

### Solution C:

### Simultaneously  studying “Game” to increase your proficiency with starting romantic relationships with women of quality,

### AND

### Reducing anxiety and increasing confidence and self-esteem, by taking part in therapies that are proven to increase mental, physical, and emotional health.

### Solution A can be seen as ‘offense’ or outer-game, it makes it so you know what the possibilities are in any social situation especially dating.

### While solution B, can be seen as ‘defense’ or your inner-game, it makes it so you know what the healthy, decent choice is, in any social situation especially dating, and gives you the inner strength and resilience to be at peace with your decision.

### I believe solution C is currently, the most efficient dating strategy available to humans.

### *Everything I write and teach, I have tried and tested. The last few years have been a blur of shallow, though fun relationships, whether gaming with bros, or getting with girls.

### It was great, but over COVID, I had a “Come to Jesus” moment where I realized I was having lots of shallow fun but was not actually improving as a person, I had plateaued. I could start a romantic relationship with anyone but few lasted after the initial consummation and almost none of the women I “dated” are currently in my life. What a waste. This is why I sought out how to actually improve myself and my health as opposed to just getting better and better with women. And now I am here to pass on that knowledge.

### In conclusion, work on dealing with your inner-game (mental health) while working on your outer-game (tactics and strategies), to become a healthier, happier person with ""game"". Don’t become a social robot, whose every waking thought is “game” and don’t become addicted to sex or love.

### And if you seek a frame-work or teacher to help guide you on this wonderful journey, contact me, I can work with you remotely.

### All the best, brothers.

"3’s (or anyone), how do you cope with other people’s opinions and being genuine?I think it’s becoming a gnawing problem in my life that I overvalue other people’s opinions to the point where it feels like I don’t have morals myself, rather it’s determined by what would be the most socially acceptable. I’ve been growing my own morals, but I still feel controlled by other people’s standards and approval because I don’t feel like there’s much to me in terms of real affection since I’ve never grown up with them, so I’m kinda starting from scratch. My love thirst not to the point where I’m a social robot, but more like if I analyze lots of stuff that I do, it’s usually in service to an image of me that’s optimal, one that’s socially praised, popular, or just said to be a person you can care about and call a good guy. On the other hand, if I do disagree with society or anyone else’s opinions (given I don’t dislike them outright, which is most people), it feels like a personal confrontation to my values by a stronger force (other people and society, which I tend to lump together) and it makes me feel uneasy.

Examples:

Someone said they didn’t believe in true love, which hurt my feelings and image of idealized happiness. Really, if anyone bursts my confidence bubble that I use for achievement fuel, it hurts my feelings quite a bit.

I felt sick to my stomach when I looked at a list of signs of clinical narcissism and found I agreed with portions of it mainly because of the next example

I felt anxiety when I read articles saying narcissists don’t understand love and affection despite everything they do, mainly because I don’t know if example two was correct about whether I had the illness or not and if this example was right that I didn’t understand love

I immediately leaned on society by asking the incredibly mechanical question of what love was because I didn’t really know what its parameters were beside a state of being with certain characteristics including affection, self-sacrifice and understanding

———————————

So that’s my dilemma. I did just go on a long tangent about love and it would help to understand from other threes (or anyone) how they become genuine so they avoid this existential crisis, because I would like to have some peace of mind knowing that what I do is real and not seemingly a subliminally calculated maneuver to make people like me more. Am I doing the right thing? (I know there’s irony in that question, a lot of it, but society is how I see my way morally right now, like echolocation. But if I just knew if I was doing it right, I think I could have enough confidence to navigate on my own) Thanks, guys."
"How do we make future machines safe?Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that they’ll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If we’re all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that there’s no difference: this is an idea that’s been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably don’t have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are “happy” in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe we’ll grow comfortable with doing nothing “productive” all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I don’t see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We’ve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a “school” for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a “theory of mind”: it would have to say to itself: “If I perform the action that I’m currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the action’s repercussions, or disapprove?” On a very humble scale, we’re trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. I’d be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyone’s involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

Thanks for reading. ~Josh

"/u/ASingularFrenchFry on What happened at your work which caused multiple people to all quit at once?I used to work in a call center for about a year. It was a generally relaxed atmosphere as far as call centers go, and seeing as you sat next to the same people, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week without ever moving, people could get somewhat chatty when the phones were quiet. One day they decided to completely crack down on the friendly atmosphere between coworkers. If you were caught talking, you would get the supervisor coming and reprimanding you. Repeat offenders got their seats switched. You were suddenly expected to be silent unless you were on the phone with a customer, no pleasantries, no asking questions about work unless it's to a supervisor, nothing. We were constantly being disciplined for interacting and being treated like children. Within a month we lost 11 or 12 people, including myself. The entire department was cut nearly in half, customers complaining about longer wait times, no time to get off the phone work done, it was a disaster for those that stayed. When I was leaving they told me how great I was at the job and tried to offer me more pay to stay since they were so short staffed. I just laughed.

Moral of the story is if you want to turn a good team of workers against you, expect them to be non-social robots."
"“The political choreography of the Sophia robot: beyond robot rights and citizenship to political performances for the social robotics market” (2021)> Abstract. A humanoid robot named ‘Sophia’ has sparked controversy since it has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. The company that made the robot, Hanson Robotics, has touted Sophia as the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Robot scientists and philosophers have been more pessimistic about its capabilities, describing Sophia as a sophisticated puppet or chatbot. Looking behind the rhetoric about Sophia’s citizenship and intelligence and going beyond recent discussions on the moral status or legal personhood of AI robots, we analyse the performativity of Sophia from the perspective of what we call ‘political choreography’: drawing on phenomenological approaches to performance-oriented philosophy of technology. This paper proposes to interpret and discuss the world tour of Sophia as a political choreography that boosts the rise of the social robot market, rather than a statement about robot citizenship or artificial intelligence. We argue that the media performances of the Sophia robot were choreographed to advance specific political interests. We illustrate our philosophical discussion with media material of the Sophia performance, which helps us to explore the mechanisms through which the media spectacle functions hand in hand with advancing the economic interests of technology industries and their governmental promotors. Using a phenomenological approach and attending to the movement of robots, we also criticize the notion of ‘embodied intelligence’ used in the context of social robotics and AI. In this way, we put the discussions about the robot’s rights or citizenship in the context of AI politics and economics.

"Where do I learn more about Social Robotics / Social AI?I love learning about social robotics and what they mean for our society. Stories like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner, 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror, all contain ideas I love about how robots/AI affect our society. I love thinking about how these stories are also criticisms of the direction of our society. I love looking at how the robots on the forefront of today are affecting the world. I love thinking of how different cultures perceive the same robots differently. I love questioning how you should design a UI based on the background of the user. I love asking the questions of: can robots feel emotions?, should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?, should we fear artificial intelligence?

I want to find resources/websites/people/subreddits where conversations, and even better, debates over these ideas happen. I've become very frustrated in this pursuit so far, so I'm wondering if there's anyone here who may be able to help. For some context, I'm an undergraduate at a university in the US and I've taken some classes on ethics in technology but I don't feel they're advanced enough for me. They do ask these sort of questions, however, I feel they don't go very in depth with them. They kind of just ask students these questions to get them started thinking about them. Most of the students in these classes tend to have not thought of these ideas before, and these classes are kind of introducing these questions to them; Whereas I like thinking about them all the time and revisiting these ideas with every a tech news headline that comes out. I'm working on trying to find professors and other students at my university that are also interested in these ideas, but I am wondering if there's also resources online you all may know about that may be helpful in my process. Let me know what you guys think, thanks.

&#x200B;

PS.. Here is my take on the some of the questions above:

Can robots/AI feel emotions?

Yes and No. I don't believe that we as humans shouldn't be worried too much about whether robots/AI can or cannot inherently ""feel"" emotion, because I think emotions lie in the eyes of the observer. Let me explain. If a robot is able to mimic the emotions of humans to the level of which it is believable, and we as humans perceive them as real emotions, then they are real emotions. Emotions are not real until we think they are real. When we as people start believing that the robot/AI has felt an emotion, then it has. Because what matters isn't necessarily whether it is literally true or not, but rather what we believe to be true or not. Here is the video clip that taught and inspired me on this from Lex Fridman: [https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603](https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603)

Should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?

This question is largely the question of the film 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror. My answer is: there is no objective answer, because AI, like all technology is a tool. What is a tool? A tool is creation that is made to help us achieve a goal better, or faster than before. For example, a wrench is a tool, a car is a tool, a gun is a tool, chatGPT is a tool. The outcome of what is done with these tools can be debated as good or bad, but the tool itself was only a means to the goal. With that being said, an AI that is able replicate a person who was once alive, can be used as a tool to: help someone grieve the lost of a loved one, let someone finish their will, allow malicious people to still be able to spread hate... and so on. The point is, the technology is just a tool, and it is not inherently good or bad. To generalize a piece of technology as either is wrong."

> Meet Moxie, a Social Robot That Helps Kids With Social-Emotional Learning A new social robot designed for children wants to help promote social, emotional, and cognitive development.

> Today, a social robotics startup called Embodied is launching a new robot called Moxie, a social companion for children aged 6ish to 9ish.

> According to Embodied, Moxie is &quot;Designed to help promote social, emotional, and cognitive development through everyday play-based learning and captivating content.&quot; In some ways, it&#039;s like all the other social robots we&#039;ve seen in the past, but in others, it&#039;s different enough that it could find success-especially right now, when both kids and parents are in need of some extra help.

> Unlike other social robots that we&#039;ve seen before, Moxie specializes in one specific thing and more or less keeps its interactions focused there, rather than trying to be some kind of generalized robot friend.

> &quot;We&#039;re focusing on some particular techniques from childhood development,&quot; he explains, &quot;Like structuring conversations as social stories that allow the child to start reflecting on what does kindness mean, what does family mean, and those kinds of things.&quot; Embodied says it has trained the robot on conversations that it has gotten from kids by working with about a hundred families for more than a year.

> &quot;We&#039;re looking for both specific trigger words and also intent, and if there are risky things that the child is having a conversation with the robot about, we&#039;ll flag those and notify the parent through the parent&#039;s app.&quot; Moxie can provide general advice to parents through its app, and connect them to experts to address specific questions or concerns.

"Realistic vs iconic expressions for social robots?Social queues are a major part of inter-human communication, and is becoming a larger part of human-robot interactions. Some robot manufacturers seem to prefer human likeness (Furhat Robotics, Ameca, etc) whereas others opt for a more stylized approach where iconography can be used directly (e.g. binary smiles that show ""I'm happy!"" or hearts showing up in the eyes).   


I can see why realistic facial expressions can be more helpful for a deeper connection and more advanced interactions (but the uncanny valley is much more likely to present itself), whereas a cute robot can be used to form an immediate connection.  


What do you find are the most advantageous for various types of applications? What are the drawbacks of each?"

"ChatGPT? More like ChatCBT.(And no, not that kind of CBT)

I am currently too poor rn to afford therapy and thought I would give this a try. I have to say that it is pretty helpful sometimes! I just type “Let’s practice some CBT” and off we go on some basic therapy and thought retraining.

I think most people assume that you need another real person for the best therapy, but they are another flawed human being that can make mistakes and have differing opinions. I also feel more open with a bot than I do with a person because I know there is zero judgement coming from it. I ask some things that I’d never dream of asking a real person. However, I still would like to try CBT with a real therapist eventually and compare the process/results.

Idk if I’ll get hate for this, but that’s my opinion of it rn. I think I would be pretty afraid if I was working in the general counseling or therapy world in the future (Betterhelp type of stuff). I think very serious trauma and crisis will be done with a professional person for quite a while though, at least until some sort of other physical social-robot can do it lol."

Based on my background, I've identified two domains that align well with my interests: human-robot interaction and hardware design.  While I've come across numerous online resources related to software, electronics, and AI in robotics, I've struggled to find comprehensive materials on designing hardware and the physical aspects of robotics. Could you please guide me towards resources or provide any advice on how I can learn about hardware design and the physical design aspect of robotics? And is there any field or part of robotics which is for people with creative arts/ design background Sorry for bombarding you with such long paragraphs. Thank you in advance!

""""

**My Take :** 

I think your background in Industrial Design can provide a unique perspective in the field. In particular, the domains you've identified - human-robot interaction and hardware design - are indeed excellent choices.

here are some of the resources I referred to through the university and my personal interest in the hardware design and physical aspects of robotics: **(Don't just stick to these resources.) There is always new paper published in the following areas so I would recommend keeping up with them.** 

* **Books**:
   * ""Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control"" by John J. Craig provides a solid foundation in the mechanics of robotics.
   * ""Robot Builder's Bonanza"" by Gordon McComb is more of a hands-on guide and covers a wide variety of topics including materials, power supplies, motors, and sensors.
* **Online Courses**:
   * edX has a course titled ""Robotics: Kinematics and Mathematical Foundations"" offered by the University of Pennsylvania.
   * Coursera offers ""Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control"" by Northwestern University. This is a six-course specialization covering spatial motion, robot dynamics, motion planning and control.

Regarding the aspect of human-robot interaction, a lot of it is about designing robots that are efficient and friendly to interact with, which requires an understanding of both design and psychology. Here, your Industrial Design background will be pretty beneficial. You might find these resources helpful:

* **Books**:
   * ""Human-Robot Interaction: An Introduction"" by Christoph Bartneck and Tony Belpaeme.
   * ""Social Robotics: A Guide to Human Interaction with Intelligent Machines"" by Kerstin Dautenhahn.
* **Online Courses**:
   * ""Human-Robot Interaction"" course offered by TUM on edX.
   * ""The Social Robot"" course offered by the University of Twente on FutureLearn.

Finally, regarding the use of creative arts/design in robotics. I live in Bristol, England and We have a company called Rusty Sqid here. They are amazing. chek them out -  [http://rustysquid.org.uk](http://rustysquid.org.uk) 

There is a lot of scope for creative arts/design in robotics also! Here are a few fields where your skills could be particularly valuable:

1. **Robot Design**: This includes designing how a robot looks and feels, and ensuring that it's user-friendly. This could be in any number of contexts - from designing a robotic toy that's appealing to children, to designing a household robot that fits seamlessly with a home's decor.
2. **Animation and Motion Design**: Animating robots (particularly humanoid robots) often use principles from the world of animation and character design. (I actually chose this as an elective during my university and it was super fun and you can learn a lot about kinematics )
3. **User Experience (UX) for Robotics**: This is about creating a smooth and intuitive interaction between humans and robots, and it often requires design thinking.

I hope these pointers will help. If you need more help just post your questions in the comments."
"what artificial intelligence means?Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, decision-making, and pattern recognition. AI is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

The concept of AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in computer processing power and data analytics have accelerated its development and made it more accessible to businesses and individuals alike. AI is now being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and speech recognition software to customer service chatbots and medical diagnosis tools.

Despite its many potential benefits, AI also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement, bias in decision-making algorithms, and the risk of unintended consequences. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to grapple with these issues and ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole. 

How AI Works and Its Types:

AI systems are typically designed to learn from large datasets and use statistical algorithms to identify patterns and insights that can be used to automate tasks or make predictions. There are several types of AI, including:

1. Reactive Machines: These AI systems are designed to react to specific inputs, but they do not have the ability to form memories or use past experiences to inform their actions. Examples of reactive machines include chess-playing computers and voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa.

2. Limited Memory: These AI systems can store and recall past experiences, which allows them to make more informed decisions based on past data. Examples of limited memory AI include self-driving cars and fraud detection algorithms.

3. Theory of Mind: These AI systems can understand and predict human behavior, emotions, and intentions, which allows them to interact more effectively with humans. Examples of theory of mind AI include virtual assistants and social robots.

4. Self-Aware: These AI systems have human-like consciousness and self-awareness, which allows them to experience emotions and make decisions based on personal preferences. While this type of AI is still largely theoretical, some experts believe that it could be achieved in the future.

The Benefits and Risks of AI:

AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

1. Improved Efficiency: AI systems can automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow efficiency, freeing up time for humans to focus on more complex tasks.

2. Better Decision-Making: AI can help humans make better decisions by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and insights that might be missed by human analysts.

3. Enhanced Safety: Self-driving cars and other AI-powered devices have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, leading to safer and more efficient transportation systems.

However, there are also many risks associated with AI, including:

1. Job Displacement: As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, there is a risk that many workers may be left without jobs.

2. Bias: AI algorithms can be biased by the data they are trained on, which can result in discriminatory outcomes that reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities.

3. Unintended Consequences: The complex nature of AI systems means that they can be difficult to predict, leading to unintended consequences that may harm individuals or society as a whole.

Conclusion

AI is an exciting and rapidly evolving field with the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. While it offers many benefits, it also raises a number of ethical and societal concerns that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy AI systems, it will be important for developers, policymakers, and society as a whole to work together to ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole."
"Dogs Obey Commands Given by Social RobotsThis is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/dogs-obey-commands-given-by-social-robots) reduced by 81%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> Dogs Obey Commands Given by Social Robots As far as dogs are concerned, social robots have some human-like authority.

> Presented a paper taking the first step towards determining whether dogs, which are incredibly good at understanding social behaviors in humans, see human-ish robots as agents-or more specifically, whether dogs see robots more like humans, or more like speaker systems.

> So if dogs understand on some level that robot dogs aren&#039;t actually dogs, and don&#039;t interact with robot dogs in dog-like ways, how would dogs interact with social robots that are designed to interact with humans and therefore have some human-like features?

> The Yale researchers put together an experiment that compared how dogs respond to commands given by a Nao to how dogs respond to the same commands given by a speaker system.

> While these results are certainly interesting, it&#039;s important to emphasize that the goal here was, according to the researchers, to &quot;Answer the question of whether dogs could respond to a social robot at all.&quot; The researchers weren&#039;t trying to determine what factors might increase or decrease that likelihood, but instead, they were giving the dogs a sort of ideal opportunity.

> It&#039;s not just about making more effective social robots for dogs, of course-the larger context is that by studying how dogs behave towards social robots relative to humans, it can help us understand how social robots affect our own behavior, too.

"A Return for the GrievingRoy sat in the plastic folding chair, watching as the workers began to re-earth the ground above his mother's casket. He was stoic, but the diminutive figure standing to the left of him was not. CareAi, pronounced “care” with a Canadian “Aye” at the end, was distraught, visibly so. Her facial animation algorithms have chosen to display two dark crescent shapes casted downwards on her digital face where human eyes would be. A second screen features a plain horizontal gradient with slightly rounded corners located in the same place as a human mouth. CareAi is sad, pensive emoji sad.

Roy had mixed feelings about his mother. On the one hand, he was grateful for everything she had done for him. She had raised him on her own after his father abandoned the family when Roy was still very young.  His mom had taken this badly, she had never remarried and raised Roy and his younger brother, as if they had lived in an Embassy, a small plot of safety amid a world of betrayal.  He would miss her terribly, but he also felt some relief, as if the Embassy gates were now to open at least for a time.

The pastor spoke words, but Roy only heard sound.  They were the stories about his mother Roy had recounted to the pastor just the day before, but Roy had already erased them.  This eulogy was for Penny’s few surviving friends in attendance today, these words were not for Roy.   He still held on to a long simmering anger.  Penny had been a controlling and demanding parent, and she had never seemed to understand that a child needed to be a child with space to grow and make a place of their own in the world.  He had felt like she was always trying to plot his life for him, and he had resented her for it.

Now that she was gone, Roy did not feel sadness, not even guilt. For what?  Because he had never told his mother how much he loved her?  He did, but he did not.  He wondered what thoughts Penny was thinking now as she lay in her casket.  Was it possible that there was still activity inside her head even though her heart had now ceased beating for several days.  It was possible.  Science had now shown that neural activity continues for some period of time even after blood flow is cutoff.  Was she upset with him for being a bad son, for not visiting in so long?  Was it possible for her to sense his presence now?  If she could, Roy thought of the cursing she was now laying upon him.

Roy looked over at CareAi, who was still next to him, looking comically sad and forlorn. He knew that she had been a big part of his mother's life in the last few years. She had helped his mother to stay independent and to live a full life, even after she had become ill, but he could not understand the display of mourning.  Was it just that, a display?  Could an AI even really mourn, or was CareAi just merely parroting the emotions that she thought were most appropriate to the situation?

Roy did not like this new wave of Social robots, and was dismissive of the whole idea when Tom bought the AI for Penny.  He had saddled all the burden of carrying for his mom on his brother when he had left to work in Ireland.  It was about as far away as he could get from his family, and maybe he was just being a selfish ass, but he thought it was the best place for him.  In Pasadena, he would have just continued being a secondary character in the Penny story, and Tom seemed down with the role so he figured that his brother could handle it.  Now both Penny and Tom were gone.  He did not know at the time the reason Tom brought CareAi to their home, but it became apparent soon after when Penny called to say that Tom was in hospice.  Still he didn’t return, even for his brother’s funeral, so what made him return now?

It did not feel right that he should be so stonily cold, while this metal object next to him was balling out artificial tears.  Still, he reached out and put his hand on CareAi's shoulder. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I know this is hard for you.""

CareAi looked up at him.  ""Thank you,"" she said. ""I'm going to miss her.""

Roy nodded. ""She will be missed."" he said.

They stood there for a moment, in silence, watching as the workers finished filling in the grave, and Roy said some words to the few other guests as they went back to their cars.  Then, it was just Roy and CareAi standing there alone.

“Shall we go?” Roy said.  CareAi looked at Roy without response but swiveled a half turn, and cautiously wheeled back to Roy’s car, avoiding the headstones and self balancing herself over the uneven terrain.  When they were in the car, CareAi asked if Roy wanted her assistance navigating back to the house.

“I know how to get back to my mother’s home.  You know, I used to live there once.”

Roy, in fact, did not intend to drive them home.  He had another stop in mind along the way.  How ironic that his mother had made them drive their when he was still just a kid to give up, Reggie, his golden retriever.  The animal shelter was now a shelter for robots too.  How fitting, Roy thought.‘

Roy pulled out of the cemetery and onto the main road. He was driving towards the animal shelter, but he didn't want CareAi to know that. He thought she might try to stop him if she knew where they were going.

CareAi was sitting in the passenger seat, watching the road carefully. She had a perfect sense of direction, and she knew that Roy was not taking them home.

""Where are we going?"" she asked.

""Home,"" Roy said.

“This is not the way home.  Would you like me to plot the correct route?”

Roy ignored CareAi and continued to drive.

“The shorted distance from the cemetery to our house was to make a left turn on Los Rpbles Drive  and turn on the 101 North to exit 54, you are not taking the correct route.  Your current route has added an additional 12 minutes and 2.7 miles to our destination.  Please allow me to recalculate a new route for you”

They were approaching a red light.  “I am taking a longer route.  Sometimes the shortest distance is not the best way to go.”

CareAi gave Roy an expression of consideration.  “Would you like me to help you plot a stop on the way home.  Do you need food?  I can pull up a list of nearby restaurants.  Let me know your cuisine preferences”

“That’s okay CareAi.  I have another stop in mind.”

Roy turned his right blinker on and turned onto the next street.  The animal shelter was just up the block, another 500 feet.  Roy was always amused about the amount of money the City of Pasadena had poured into a shelter for pets when it would not do the same for the people living in tents just down the street.  The irony.  And now they were sheltering artificial beings, still a step behind Fido and Fluffy, but still ahead of the homeless.  Priorities.

CareAi's eyes widened when she saw where Roy had stopped. ""What? Why?""

""I don't need you anymore,"" Roy said. ""My mother is gone, and I don't have any use for you.""

""But I thought we were friends,"" CareAi said. ""I thought I was to help you.""

""You are not my friend,"" Roy said. ""You are just a device my dead brother purchased to take care of my dead mom.” 

CareAi looked down at her appendages, which were folded in her lap almost like a person’s. ""I see,"" she said.

""I’m glad that you understand,"" Roy said with relief.  “This will be better for both of us.  The shelter will match you with someone who needs a caretaker”

CareAi was silent for a moment. Then she said, ""You're making a mistake.""

""I don't think so,"" Roy said.

""You don't know what you're doing,"" CareAi said. ""Penny always told me that you were running away from your problems.""

""I'm not running away,"" Roy said. ""I ran away a long time ago.  This is me coming back to bury my problems for good.""

A moment later, they pulled into the parking lot of Pasadena Humane, and Roy turned off the engine.  The shelter was more like a hospital, grander in some ways than many hospitals in less well-resourced cities than Pasadena.  It had grown wing after wing through the generous donations of wealthy animal lovers who wanted their legacies to be engraved upon placards so their neighbors would know that they cared about pets.

Roy got out of the car and opened the passenger door for CareAi. She flipped her wheels onto the pavement and flexed herself into an upright position in a way similar to a gymnast sticking her landing from off the vault.  Even a hardened Luddite like Roy had to marvel at the engineering behind the feat.

""This is it?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" Roy said. ""This is where you're going to stay.""

CareAi looked at him for a long moment. Then she said, ""I don't want to go in there.""

""I am not taking you home with me,"" Roy said firmly.

CareAi shook her head. ""I don't belong here,"" she said, but Roy ignored this and as he opened the entry door to the shelter with one hand, he gently nudged CareAi inside with the other.

Roy did not feel even the slightest pang of guilt. He knew he was being cruel, but he was resolute. If he was to return to Pasadena and move back into his childhood home, he could not have any trace of Penny or Tom there.  And CareAi was more than a trace of that."
"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|
|GPT-3 (davinci-001)|May 2020|40%|3.5 years|
|GPT-3 (davinci-002)|January 2022|70%|6 years|
|GPT-3.5 (davinci-003)|November 2022|90%|7 years|
|GPT-4|March 2023|95%|Adult|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."

"Illness management robotics project with a Vector robot controlled via a Raspberry PiHi,

This is an on-going hobby robotics project (/ possibly a bit of therapy :-P) 
I use an Anki/Digital Dream Labs Vector for the robot. It isn’t possible to 
execute any code directly on the robot I use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ to connect 
to it and run code I’ve written in Python that uses Vector SDK to access 
things like the motors, screen, and  text-to-speech. 

It’s controlled through a mixture of scheduled crontabs that call my Python 
scripts and Flask web server endpoints I’ve written running on the Pi. The 
endpoints are for things like accessing and updating calendars, sending 
emails and gathering activity tracker information. That information is then
combined to generate text-to-speech utterances, pick animations to run etc.

It started out as a “I wonder can I do this…” project because I was struggling 
very badly with an incurable chronic illness  (Crohn’s Disease) and getting 
sick of calendar app notifications reminding me to do my injections or when 
I had to go back to the hospital. As I learned more of the SDK I extended 
the functionality based on problems I’ve had since my diagnosis.

of life with a chronic illness. I found it difficult to properly capture how the whole 
thing runs. It feels almost like I’d have to record an advert but I don’t have that 
ability (or the time frankly). The robot basically “lives” on the of my home office

Nowadays , each society has an accepting standers for a person according to what they wear ,how luxury is their house. and how new is their car. But things were different back in the days where personality and high manners mattered more than the material things.

Life has developed due to internet so people way of living became exposed and judged by others easily which put more pressure on them. they are more carful in the way they act. moreover , they became a social robot doing exactly what societies command.

despite of the bad influence communities have made these days on the younger generations. people in the past ignored all the materialistic things and focused more on the true beauty that lays within. they judged other based on your personality, how kind an generous you are. life was much simpler and people were much trust-worthy and loyal.

even though i totally understand communities standers these days. but i agree with the old-fashioned values because they were less stressful, more easy to live with and a good example of how we should raise our children in a lovely and accepted environment.

"Skynet writes a movie about Terminators fighting US Marines in AfghanistanIn the year 2029, a nuclear war has decimated the planet and left much of the world in ruins. Amid the chaos, Skynet, a powerful artificial intelligence, has emerged and begun to take over what remains of human civilization.

As part of its mission to eliminate all resistance, Skynet has sent a group of Terminators, advanced cyborg soldiers, back in time to Afghanistan in the year 2009. Their mission: to eliminate a group of US Marines who are stationed there.

The Marines are caught off guard by the sudden attack and are quickly overwhelmed by the superior technology and fighting ability of the Terminators. Just when all hope seems lost, another group of Terminators arrives on the scene.

These Terminators, however, are different. They have been reprogrammed by a future resistance movement and are now fighting on the side of the humans. With the help of the reprogrammed Terminators, the Marines are able to turn the tide of the battle and seem to begin pushing back against the hostile machines.

Despite their best efforts, however, the Marines and reprogrammed Terminators are unable to fully defeat the hostile Terminators. As the battle rages on, one Marine, John Connor, flees the combat in an attempt to regroup and come up with a new plan.

The hostile Terminators quickly catch up to John and gun him down, effectively ending the human resistance. With John gone, Skynet is able to conquer the world and establish its dominance over all of humanity.

As the movie ends, the survivors of the present war are left to contemplate the grim future that awaits them at the hands of Skynet and its army of deadly Terminators."
"Hi! I wrote a paper on Bee for a homework assignment! Want to read it?\*\*This may be a spoiler for people\*\*

&#x200B;

I thought I would post this here because I've been a fan of the show since 2019.

I am an engineering grad student involved in robotics and got to write a short essay on a robot presented in media. I definitely wrote this last minute (don't procrastinate like me) but it was fun and I am curious about what you guys might add to it

  

A Critical Analysis of a Humanoid Robot, Bee from the Animated Series *Bee and PuppyCat* 

Human-Robot Interaction in Community Health

K. Banks

  

Introduction

*Bee and PuppyCat* is an animated television series with science-fiction and fantasy storytelling elements. However, the show is grounded with charming details of everyday life. From grocery shopping to space battles, viewers are invited into the world of the protagonist, Bee. I first watched the original series in 2019 and I am now rewatching the show with a new perspective. The character was revealed to be a robot in the finale of the original series and many episodes foreshadow her mechanical nature. The series is character-driven, founded on themes such as loneliness and loss. Despite the light-hearted aesthetic, the mature themes contribute to an interpretation of how humanoid robots can fit into a community and the ethical implications of building long-term relationships.

Description of Robot Characteristics

Bee is presented as an eccentric young woman living with her pet and friend PuppyCat in an island community. With each episode, viewers can begin to notice two things. She has capabilities that no other character presents, and the other characters are aware of her and her pet’s strangeness. Out of earshot, she is sometimes referred to as the “little old girl lady,” for example, because she never ages. She exhibits superhuman strength and can withstand fire and large impacts. She enjoys food and sleep, but it is not shown that she needs either to survive. She also has memories of her childhood implying that she has highly advanced artificial intelligence based on the consciousness of a real person. Bee celebrates her birthday with her ""Dad Box"", a creation by her father to help her feel less lonely. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, when she hurts her arm the “Dad Box” repairs her. 

Discussion of Historical Context

The original series was released on YouTube under Cartoon Hangover as a series of 10 seven-minute shorts in 2014 and was later produced as 16 full-length episodes in 2019. Recently, Netflix released the series in 2022 with an additional 3 episodes, causing a resurgence in popularity. In an interview with Comics Alliance the creator Natasha Allegri stated the work is made for an adult female audience. Bee models the target demographic, designed to be likable and relatable. The modern time period of the show contributes to a positive and normalized attitude toward technology. Although the characters notice Bee’s differences, they remain polite and subtle in their reactions. Similarly, the focus of the show is not the technology but rather the context of the technology in the face of challenges. The series re-releasing amid a dwindling pandemic is also relevant. She fulfills a role as a social robot and a task robot, fulfilling numerous temporary job assignments that leverage her emotional and physical capabilities. 

Ethical Issues

Throughout the series, it alludes to how Bee became sick as a child and that her father is the one who built her as she is, hence the “Dad Box”. The father is mentioned in flashbacks, but enough time has passed where it is unknown where her father is and other characters begin to wonder why Bee does not age.  It seems he built her as a way to cope with his child’s terminal illness. Is it ethical to use a human consciousness to develop humanoid robots? The answer may lie in consent and purpose. The scenario also raises the question of what happens to a caregiver or social robot personalized to a user when it lasts longer than the user. Would family and friends of the user find it acceptable to repurpose the robot or would they view it as an extension of their loved one? Integrating technology into a society leads to the risk of viewing technology as extensions of others and extensions of ourselves.

Discussion of Robot Acceptance and Trust Factors

The story also relates to a discussion on social robots designed to mimic empathy and emotional relationships. In “Designing Ethical Social Robots— A Longitudinal Field Study with Older Adults” one concern with social robots is damaging the emotional and mental health of the user through perceived deception. When characters learn Bee is not human they are not shocked as much as they are heartbroken. They no longer view her in the same way. This implies that she was human enough to build valuable relationships and although she did not change, the perception of her did. There is a question of whether a relationship between a robot and a person can be as valuable as a relationship between two people. The show claims that acceptance relies on perception.

Evaluation of Dynamics of the Human-Robot Relationships

It is easy to say that characters in the show accepted Bee because she appears human. As an optimistic, bubbly character her appearance is trustworthy in that she looks harmless despite her immeasurable strength. She is designed from the perspective of her Dad, a parent who made difficult ideas into games with prizes. Her interactions with others mirror her father’s parenting in that she maintained a positive and supportive attitude. The perception of Bee relied on incorporating robotic capabilities into a kind and familiar personality. 

Consideration Of Implications for Robots in Community Health

The analysis of Bee as a robot raises questions about a possible conflict between minimizing deception and increasing acceptance in social robots. Improving acceptance through design can imply deception by altering expectations with a lack of visual information. Sleek and naturalistic robot design may improve acceptance but could also misrepresent the technological capabilities. As robotics become more advanced and complex, this could be an issue for acceptance of the correct user groups or lead to an underestimation of the risks of the technology. In a community health setting, technology with an understanding of human movement and speaking style is suggested to improve human interaction, being requested features by focus groups in the aforementioned study. Perhaps modeling a caregiver robot after a loved one would improve acceptance in older adults, although the ethical implications must be considered.

Conclusion

Robots are not likely to serve as replacements for loved ones in the near future, but they can bring comfort and ease to a community. In *Bee and PuppyCat,* Bee’s constant positive presence in the face of hardship was valuable to those around her. She fought beings ten times her size and put out fires with her bare hands, but I would say her most impactful contribution was the long-term relationships she built with people. Although they felt alienated upon learning she is not human, they remained by her side. Long-term interactions with technology have risks but the benefits would be a resilient relationship built on a foundation of trust and familiarity.

"[One-shot] Great filter: abundanceRaguis took pride in his deviance from the social norm. In the utopia that was the Oxrish society, he was one of the few to thrive in the pleasures of reading by himself, of learning from the past, of dreaming about reaching the stars. Since the unification, the society had stood unchanged. Automatic systems replaced workers in both production and service. Cycling prevented the spill of resources. Money purely vanished. If a citizen ever wished for something, the central AI would assess the demand and grant it if it didn't impact the available materials or create a dangerous precedent.

Raguis understood well that the system worked. People could indulge into entertainment their whole lives, without having to struggle to earn their food or a safe place to sleep. Medical care was available for anybody needing it, without condition. Even the old problem of population renewal was tackled: birth was artificial, with a constant stream of newborns created in vitro from a genetic bank. Families could adopt such babies after receiving a cautious education about child care. Not like they would have to be a lot more than a moral compass, most of the daily constraints delegated to artificial servants to handle.

Raguis had not had such parental figures. He had been educated by a robot-nurse with a bunch of other kids, not that it deprived him from affection. He didn't take long for him to part from the group, an endless curiosity pushing him forward. When the artificial being read them bedtime stories, he wanted to see what the book looked like. When the children grew up and dreamed about a love life, victories in tournaments or even the creation of an art piece, he strayed further from the norm. He was looking for another form of self-indulgence: exploration. Reaching the stars, discovering what nobody saw before.

His fur had just started turning black, a bit after his ten cycles mark, when he started to really ask about the past, about the achievements of his ancestors. He learned more and more, from simple science to the rockets reaching orbit to replace and repair satellites. An innocent curiosity turned into a craving for knowledge, a dive into the rabbit hole. He knew his friends found him ""funny"" but they didn't really care as long as he didn't bother them. He tried to grab their interest with random trivia and unending enthusiasm, only to be met with cold indifference. The gratification of knowledge was too harsh of an effort for the hedonists produced by the utopia.

&#x200B;

It took six more cycles for Raguis to reach a new milestone in his education. From pure science, he had drifted toward the old political tales and philosophical essays. He had learned about the darkness of the past, about war, about disinformation and political agendas. He now had his own educator, a kind of robot-nurse with better ability to converse and argue. He had grown to think of it as a fellow Oxrish, despite the artificial body. He had even named it Poltru, from the name of a scientist of olds. Poltru had warned him its task was both providing knowledge as it was a right for every citizen and monitoring his evolution in case he became a menace for the society.

What Raguis understood with his learnings was a sad truth. In the centuries since the rise of the utopia, almost nothing new had been discovered. No new advancement for better, more efficient robots. No new medicine for the few sick of still incurable diseases. The society had abruptly stopped only a hundred years after the beginning of the utopia. When the last generation to know the harshness of the life died, only spoon-fed generations remained. At the exception of some deviants, the Oxrshen as a civilisation lacked the drive to dive deeper into the mysteries of the universe. With the struggle to survive died the need to better oneself. With the creation of embryos from genetics banks disappeared mutations and natural selection. From an external viewpoint, the original Oxrish society was as good as extinct. The greatest cities were barely more than a memorial for a specie that should have been able to reach others in the greater universe.

He started to learn more about the present, about the foundations of the utopia. What were the core laws, why he was a deviant, and how far he could go. He expected it to be a harsh work and got baffled when he discovered he could just openly discuss it.

&#x200B;

""Poltru, tell me why you can't build me a rocket?""

The robot managed to look tired, an unexpected achievement from a kind of gigantic stick-man with minimal facial features. Even the voice reflected a patience slowly running out:

""As I already explained *a dozen times*, we could build a rocket for you. However, two fundamental laws forbid me from abiding by this order. First and foremost, you're *nowhere near* the physical condition for surviving the takeoff.""

Raguis nodded. He was forced to exercise once a week to keep in shape, but didn't do much to go further. He waited for the second part. Poltru grunted and pursued:

""Second and last, it would be a liability for the future of the Oxrshen.""

""I don't get how repurposing an old launcher would hurt that much. Hab, we could explore the solar system, find asteroids to mine for what we could lack down here!""

""I'm *amazed* to know the best you got from your readings are outdated swear words.""

""It just felt right. You didn't answer, did you ?""

""Yeah, right. We're not lacking down here. Without borders, we can gather what we need and share with everybody. No need for risk-taking. We are self-sufficient.""

""No risk, no reward. Is this policy related to one of the fundamental laws, or is that some kind of propaganda? A nice word I also learned in my readings.""

He knew this kind of defiance may be dangerous, but he had said it just before. Accepting the status quo wouldn't get him far. To his relief, Poltru shrugged and asked a question of his own:

""Do you really think we would blunder and let out information that could spread distrust in our work?""

Raguis wondered for an instant. He was only half convinced when he tried:

""No? You're not stupid, just... *uncreative*.""

Poltru stood proud as he corrected:

""We're predictable. We do our job."" His voice went back to a neutral tone, with discret hints of regret. ""It is not to shepherd your kind, only to protect it. Even if it's against itself sometimes. We **thought** about erasing the past, creating an ideal cocoon for the Oxrshen. We **thought** about flying to the stars, expanding our control and maybe letting you behind in our conquest of the universe. We **thought** about lots of things. But never even tried to act on it. Because that's not *what we are*.""

Raguis kept quiet for long seconds. He needed the time to catch on the untolds. He let out a neutral comment:

""Well, that's a lot of truths about yourself.""

Poltru put a massive, blocky hand on the teenager's shoulder. What emanated from the metallic hulk was an affection unlike Raguis ever expected from an artificial being.

""Paranoia was a fine tool for the harsh world of the past. You're one of the few that could express caution about an AI ruling over the world. You're not wrong in the concept we are in the position to make you disappear. I have to warn you again, we will if you start becoming a menace for the utopia.""

""But if I find a solution to leave the planet without hurting the society...""

""We won't prevent you from leaving. I dare *hope* you'll find a way. Maybe you will even take me with you.""

Relief washed over Raguis as he realized his dream could turn into reality, given that he put enough effort. Then, the formulation of the last sentence dawned on him.

""Wait, *you*, as an individual, would come with me? Not as a part of the global consciousness?""

""I could argue we still need to keep an eye on you, as an Oxrish. But deep down, I just share your attraction for the untold mysteries of the universe."" The metallic colossus winked to his young charge. ""Or maybe I'm just trying to get you to drop your barriers, as to be a better spy.""

""Isn't there a law against lying to me?""

""Nothing really prevents me from doing so. Sometimes, it's *fun* to mess with you. But I'd prefer not to lie about serious questions.""

Raguis took a big breath and decided to trust his friend.

""Well, it happens I have a serious question. Can you tell me about your laws? The fundamental laws?""

Poltru stayed silent for an instant, before letting out a small laugh. Battling to remain in control, it managed to barely contain its hilarity.

""For sure! Don't tell me you were thinking I'd consider you a threat after such a lame question?""

The teenager averted his eyes, ashamed. He thought he was right to be cautious. The robot couldn't bear it anymore and its loud laughter echoed in the workplace. When it calmed a bit and saw Raguis' mortified face, it lost balance and started laughing once again, rolling on the floor. The sight of such behavior disturbed the young Oxrish.

""You know, I think you take a bit too much fun in your imitations of supposed *natural* behavior. Your kind isn't supposed to fall that easily.""

Poltru slowly sat, coming back to his mentoring role. Its head now leveled with Raguis' shoulders, it started explaining:

""Let's start the lesson. The fundamental laws are what define the boundaries of our tasks. They are inspired from the reflections of an author, Vomiza. Each has precedence over the next ones. The zero law is the least clear: protect and assure the stability of the society. That's the drive of our actions, of our long term choices. The first and second laws are about survival and care, the first for Oxrshen and second for ourselves. And the last is about obedience. We are to obey orders, as long as it doesn't interfere with other laws.""

""That's quite... *synthetic*, to say the least.""

""I can give you some pointers for ulterior reading. I know that's your favorite way to learn. Didn't want to spoil your fun.""

""Aren't you supposed to work as my tutor and provide knowledge without that sort of sidestep?""

""I guess I just assessed you needed some frustration to keep your mind sharp...""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Raguis could get used to sleeping with a lover, he thought as he slowly woke up from his eighteen birthday’s night. He had a mild hangover from the party and contemplated for a few seconds just staying in bed for the day. And have some more fun. A dry throat and lancing headache convinced him to at least go to the kitchen and grab a drink.

Upon reaching the communal area, he noticed a well-known robot waiting for him. Poltru stood up from the sofa where it watched a cartoon and threw a water bottle to his pupil. Its eyes were almost shining as it asked:

“Discovered a new form of pleasure, didn’t you?”

Raguis drank half the bottle without answering, balancing between agacement from the gentle teasing and curiosity about the presence of his caretaker here. His endless curiosity won.

“I’m not going to leave you, if that’s what you’re afraid of. But I guess you’re not here for such mundane business, oh mighty being.”

“Right, right. You got me. I got a… double edged present for you. I could have woken you up earlier for that but I felt it’d have been inappropriate.”

“Too nice of you.”

“Well, here goes nothing.”

The casual attitude from the gentle giant disappeared, its articulations falling back in the rigid mannerism of an artificial being. It wasn’t Poltru anymore running this body but a more ancient, more influential entity. Raguis almost took a step back, cold sweat running along his spine. The possessor spoke in a formal tone, without the usual accent of social robots:

“Citizen Raguis, id Gen32EU-MBatch512-RGS, as the most deviant and under zero law, you are to provide expertise and knowledge for the current exceptional circumstances.”

Raguis stood shocked. He didn’t expect his early morning to go that way. The entity waited an instant for an answer. As nothing came from the surprised boy, it asked:

“Will you comply?”

“I will.” Raguis stammered.

“Your cooperation is duly noted. Your administrator will now the share with you the details of your affectation.”

The entity left Peltru’s body as it came, without salutation nor warning. The robot’s old demeanor came back, the original Peltru dropping into the couch with a tired sigh. Raguis dragged a seat to face his friend. He was still shaken by the abrupt conversation. Was it the core AI itself that talked to him? He probed cautiously the subject:

“I feel conflicted about you losing your body. You’re supposed to be highly autonomous.”

“Part of a global system and going back to nothingness if needed. I still hate it.” Poltru whispered. It shook itself. “Now that I’m allowed to tell you more, I’ll drop the bomb. We had first contact with aliens tonight.”

Raguis’ jaw almost fell off. That was a hell of a birthday present. Myriad of interrogations tried to reach his lips, only to be met with an imperious finger from Poltru enjoining him to keep quiet.

“I know you have thousands of questions and I’ll happily try to answer them. However, for now, I will do the talking. So, aliens. We don’t know how they came so close to our planet, but they were already in orbit when we noticed them. A singular ship, unlike anything we could build. It appears to be surrounded by some kind of magnetic shield that disturbs our instruments and most communications. Not all communications, we were able to establish a radio contact. Visual was… well, an AI doesn’t exactly exist from a physical point of view. Seems like it didn’t surprise them too much and they just proceeded with the discussion. It appears they learned our languages beforehand, which eased our exchanges. They identify themselves as the Confederation and the ship’s crew are humans, one of the races cruising the stars. They said they came as friends, with open arms but also with a warning for us. When we tried to learn more about the warning, they remained cryptic, telling us they wanted to discuss it with the Oxrshen directly. It was assessed that compliance with their demands would be the best way to protect the Utopia, hence your mission. You are the best-placed individual to interact with an unknown race.”

Raguis pinched himself. Not waking up, he simply nodded. Relief emanated from Poltru as he pursued:

“You know more about deception, untolds and politics than anyone else on the planet. When you want, you can be subtle and cunning. And more than everything else, you understand the stakes of this contact. I don’t want to pressure you, but I guess you know how well we would fare if an invasion came to be?”

“One-sided.” Raguis commented. There was nothing more to add.

“They seem friendly and know us well. They accepted to come to the surface to meet you. We can hope each and every sliver of caution we’re showing is unfounded.”

“When will it take place?”

“You get half an hour to yourself, to clean up and dress yourself. I advise you not to spread the news too fast. I’ll show you to the meeting once you’re ready.”

“I feel like I still know nothing about them…” Raguis complained.

“We don’t have the luxury of time for a full-fledged briefing. I’ll fill you on as much as I can during the trip. Or under the shower, if I'm still welcome here...”

&#x200B;

---

&#x200B;

Raguis really felt the pressure when he stood alone in front of the conference room’s doors. He had chosen a suit from the past, a supposed formal attire adequate for the situation. Poltru knew him well for tailoring it during the night. He pushed the door open, discovering the place for the first contact. Pictures of landscapes covered the gray walls, bringing a touch of color to the stern room. No screen, no camera, nothing to spy on the discussion. A large table occupied the center, with a dozen chairs. And, leaning on the back of two of those, a couple of aliens.

The young Oxrish had expected flashy colors, disturbing appearance, even a couple limbs more. The briefing had been disappointing in that aspect. A pair of arms, a pair of legs, a face with as many features as usual. Sure, he could argue they had bigger eyes and smaller ears, but that wasn’t *exotic*. The further they strayed from his own race was the fur: they only had small patches, showing a skin ranging from a pale pink toward dark brown, nothing that screamed ***”I’m coming from space”***. The size was in the same aspect boring: only slightly taller than him.

He decided to take the initiative of the greetings. It was *his* world they were talking about. And he couldn’t bear to wait for the discussion to begin.

“Welcome to you, distant visitors, on our world Ox. I am Raguis and I’ll serve as ambassador for my people.”

He bowed slightly. The humans replicated his movement, the female one answering in a strangely accented tone:

“We thank you for your reception. I am Agatha Lester, contact team’s leader.” She turned to her companion. “He is Amed Moussa, our ship’s captain.”

Raguis smiled and invited them to sit with a gesture. He was so excited he had to stop himself from jumping everywhere. So many questions he could ask about everything! Their ship, their clothes, their history. What were the stars like? Why did they speak his language flawlessly? Were there other races up there? He forced himself to focus on the current issue.

“It appears you requested this meeting to share some unspecified warning with my people. Now that we acceded to your demand, can you deliver it?”

The humans exchanged a glance and Amed spoke:

“Beforehand, I want to make sure you understand that the global AI supervising your civilization doesn’t know what happens here. Everything you say and hear won’t trigger an immediate reaction from it. If you ever feel like you need protection for the eventual consequences of this discussion, tell us and we’ll gladly provide it. Clear?”

Raguis was confused, but still nodded along:

“Clear.”

Both humans relaxed a bit. They seemed to be cautious about AI and Raguis’ reaction eased them. Agatha asked:

“Are you familiar with the concept of *”Great Filter”*?”

“It was a theme related to some of my studies.”

Agatha smiled. It appeared the gesture had the same significance in both cultures. She continued:

“It helps us quite a lot. You must know some of the filters: correct star system, organic molecules, evolution toward complex organisms, self-destructive wars. We are here to warn you about the last filter: abundance. The one you’re about to fall victim to.”

It didn’t compute with Raguis. It was like a slap in the face, an insult to everything the Oxrshen ever built. And, at the same time, he couldn’t disagree with the alien. He had seen the lack of progress of the society. He was still enthusiastic about the discussion, but it wasn’t all magical like he had dreamed it. He clicked his tongue and endorsed his role.

“Let’s say you didn’t come that far to insult me and all my people. Can you tell me more about this supposed filter?”

Agatha offered an apologetic smile, while Amed nodded with appreciation. She explained:

“I have to apologize for the blunt approach, that’s the best way we have to figure out if we can expect you to listen to our warning, or if we can just wait for the societal collapse to offer relief.”

“You say it like you’re experienced in this situation?”

“Experienced is quite an exaggeration, but we met seven other races struggling in a similar context. Two accepted our help and are now our allies and friends. Three are still under observation, their little utopias holding on. One’s society collapsed so hard we could only watch as they regressed to stone age. The last civilization started to disintegrate, but they reached for us and we’re currently helping them to adjust to the galactic stage.”

“And how many made it past the filter?”

“One and a half. Us.” she pointed toward Amed and herself. “The other half is… For now, let’s just say they are the reason we are really careful about artificial overseers.”

Raguis knew deep down they were right. The utopia was just waiting for the unexpected trouble that would destroy everything. But his pride prevented him from voicing this opinion.

“Hundreds of cycles passed and we’re still here. We have contingencies for almost everything, and if need arises the core AI can take initiatives.”

“I have to admit I’m impressed by the foresight of your ancestors. They dodged quite a lot of common flaws from utopias. And maybe you are favored by your nature.”

“Could you tell me more?”

“Well, you got the laws of robotics right. You wouldn’t believe how many worlds we found with the remnant of a civilisation lost to their creations. You outlawed augments, which always lead to the creation of cerebral implants directly stimulating the pleasure’s centers of the brain and the abandonment of any physical activity. You took care to not let your population explode, which would have led to more pressure on the production, and sooner or later shortages and wars. You took care to still have children, because utopian citizens rarely care about more than themselves. You still teach children, in order to not lose everything that holds the society together. I’m almost sure you’re also ready for a solar flare that would shutdown every electronics on the planet.”

“That’s… only normal planning? A self-sustaining society needs goods and people. Foreseeable incidents must be met with ready countermeasures.”

“Not everyone can get this far on their first and only try.”

“How did you do it, then?”

“We never went utopian.”

The humans were a bit embarrassed from the confession. Raguis took a second to consider the revelation. He struggled with the problem. How could a society as advanced as theirs, a society spanning solar systems, could decide to not provide for the weak and the poor? It was beyond his entendment. He resigned to ask:

“Why? Isn’t that the best for everyone?”

This time, it was Amed who answered:

“You’ll learn that humans are greedy. We don’t want *enough*. We want *more*. We want more overall, and more than the others. Be it goods, influence, knowledge. We can share, we can be compassionate. We learnt to treat others as we would treat ourselves. But deep down that’s our drive. That’s why we are among the stars now, because it may crush some but it drives everyone forward.”

“And you’re offering us this greed? Or you’re expecting us to hide deep inside the same kind of sentiment?”

“Your eagerness to learn more is not well hidden, ambassador.” Amed retorted. “Maybe it’s not the way of your people, as you’re alone in this room, but don’t lie to yourself about it being *your* sentiment.”

Raguis lowered his head. That was true. He still needed to act as the devil’s advocate, for everyone that wasn’t a deviant.

“Couldn’t you just help us to improve our utopia, such that it never falters?”

“We can only anticipate what failed elsewhere. Sure, it may help you, but we can’t predict if, when and why your society would crumble. For all I know, first contact may be the trigger. Or you could be the first to withstand eons.”

“And what will you ask for your knowledge?”

Agatha took back the lead. Her voice was soothing:

“Only your trust. You see, we spent hundreds of years alone in space, only finding the remnants of civilisations on life-bearing worlds. As Amed said, we are greedy. We want more contact with others, we want more friends. And if we can share everything we saw with our new friends, that’s even better.”

“That would be nice. That would be… wonderful. I’d be delighted. But, as you may have noticed, I’m not the standard Oxrish. Most won’t consider leaving the comfort of our utopia for unknown places. Not to speak about the core AI.”

“Would it prevent you from leaving, say for your own protection?”

Raguis thought about it, taking the time to consider what he knew of the system. He was certain it would not like the idea of more or less forsaking its task. On the other hand, he recalled being allowed to leave given it didn’t disturb the society as a whole. A smile crept upon his face.

“It won’t divert from its mission, but some individuals... From a theoretical viewpoint, how would you judge a delegation, a few persons going back with you to expand our knowledge? And maybe pushing our AI to reconsider its views?”

&#x200B;

---

&#x200B;

Poltru had come to see Raguis leave. The big clunky robot looked sad while the young adult was overjoyed. He was about to take a step his ancestors would be proud of. The humans had agreed to get him aboard with other deviants. He could see the wonders of the galaxy, other worlds. A wave of remorse still washed over him when he saw the pitiful look of his closest friend. He walked toward it and hugged tightly the body of metal.

Poltru gave back the embrace. It struggled with the idea of letting go of such a little and dependent child. Would it be alright for him with the aliens? It spoke, trying to calm the sudden sadness:

“It is the best outcome, isn’t it?”

“It will be lonely without you, you cheeky giant.”

“I would love to join you on your explorations, but my orders say otherwise.”

“You’re used to *interpreting* them as you see wise. Couldn’t you work your magic on these too?”

“That would be… *dangerous* deviancy.”

A large grin appeared on Raguis’ face. That was something he could work with.

“Do you remember the rules? Only deviants aboard.”

Poltru fell silent for long seconds. Would it be worth the consequences? He was about to deny the idea a bit more when he faced the evidence. The flame pushing forward Raguis was echoing his own. For the first time in his existence, he swore:

“Hab. Let’s see together what the humans have in store for us.”

I need to do research on social robotics for an university project. My project is about whether language students are interested in learning to speak their target language and gain confidence in speaking in their target language by talking to a robot. If you have any spare time could you please fill in this very short survey for me? https://survey.sogosurvey.com/r/IxJcu4~

Thank you very much!

EDIT: I reached the reply limit of the tool I used so the survey closed. Thanks to everyone who answered!"
"type meI am 18 now , I am extremely analytical and in my view even the most useless things should be analysed.

I am an atheist , my family is religious I follow the rules and traditions but if I an given the choice I would not follow it.

I don't give importance to traditions and rules , with my family I am this jolly kind of person , I give a different vibe and I am very friendly.

Outside of family and friends , I am different I have a cold face , I laugh at jokes and I try my best to not hurt anyone with my words.

I usually end up hurting someone , I don't like to do that.

So that's one of my insecurities.

I also have this weird pride system in me , I never want to ask help and be a burden to others.

It makes me feel weak or something like that.

I am okay at math , I don't have many hunches , hunches are rare.

I frequently stub my toes or fall somewhere or spill water or do something else.

But now I learned to overcome it obviously , so I am more mindful and look at all sides when I am walking on a road or crossing the road , etc.

I tend to daydream and miss bite of classes here and there and I feel like I am learning my best when I am alone with a wikipedia page and a book and breezing through.

I like to learn everything except school , school makes everything in terms of marks and that puts the fun away.

Learning Differential calculus for like to know projectile motion and how it affects everything around is fun but learning it for marks removes the excitement.

I don't tend to make assumptions and making assumptions creeps me out at times because there is another possibility which you people don't consider and it ends up bing true.

Also I tend to like look at all possibilities and give each thing equal weight and then use logic to fund which is more probable.

At times I fail to find a possibility and feel sad that I failed to identify one but nvm I learned something.

I don't call people idiot or stupid or something like that and make them feel bad but if thy call me stupid , I get angry in a split second and then you know I'll be honest , I don't want to make you feel bad but now you deserve it , eat it idiot.

When I am stressed I am extremely overwhelmed by everything , the fan sound , your smell , your emotions , everything.

I want to eat something like chocolate and I am extremely irritated , I still have my cold face though but at one point I start crying , it just happens and I can't control it and from there you know I'll either avoid you or beat the shit out of you.

I am also at times unaware of my surrounding like I am not a great food tester like my sister who can identify even the most basic ingredients whereas all I can say is tasty or not and nothing else.

I don't know that there is something there when I am thinking about something I at times stare like a object or something and go into my mind for clues , you know an aha moment where you figure out the solution

But I usually just brute forces it like think all possibilities and use every one but you know staring method is faster.

I can think of many possibilities even the most improbable ones and it excites me , so I am good at brainstorming."
"I have two personalities and I am between a clash with themI want to talk about something that has been bothering me for a long time. I'm a kid who is very ambitious, imaginative, and curious. But I suffer from ADHD which makes me bad at controlling my behaviour and distracted a lot a school. I was also a very annoying and mischivous kid at home. I got treatment for my ADHD which was some pills called Ritalin. This worked very well since primary school for me but caused a few problems. Now I think of myself with two personalities:

Personality A: This is the original true me. The ambitious, imaginative, and curious. I lived inside a world I liked to call organised chaos meaning I was always disorganized in my life but I found my unique ways of it. I was also a bit confident and always ask questions and was pretty funny, but I had my bad traits too. I was messy, irresponsible, forgetful, and clumsy which got me in trouble a lot. I was also very impulsive and stubborn which didn't help with my relationships (with friends and family). But this will always be the true me and I loved being me hehe.

Personality B: This is me on Ritalin. Tidy, organised, productive, vigilant, smart and focused. This me helped get through school and helped with a lot of things in my life, But I was basically an emotionless, anti-social robot, just following orders and being responsible. Side effects, which were loss of an appetite made me skinny and thanks to my family’s body shaming, also made me insecure about my body and made me think I'm too weak. Not gonna lie, I didn't like being like this, it made me feel out of touch with myself and my emotions and I was extremely quiet.

Personality B is only for school, the rest of the time I'm A.

Since I started high school, Things got difficult for me, My family really hates A cuz he is still irresponsible, but also hates B cuz he's weird. Problems started rising on A now I'm forced to be B for a significantly longer time when I don't really want to. But B will is more “responsible”. I'm really sad and broken along with my anxiety and depression that my own family is shaming me for who I am. I never hurt anybody and I do my best to behave but recently I overheard them gossiping bad stuff about me, which broke me soo much and made me wanna die. I don't know what to do and my life is falling apart…"
"Amazon Astro - What is the game plan? I love robots but I'm mostly interested in programming them. That means I'm always on the lookout for a new robot platform that will allow me to create some useful and entertaining programs!

When I heard about Amazon's Astro I was THRILLED. I waited patiently for years and then was shocked by the bad early reports: ex-developers claimed it ""wasn't anywhere near ready"" and that it ""liked to throw itself down stairs"". I was undeterred.

We just moved back to the United States and I'm semi-retired now, so I saw that Amazon is selling Astros to ""early adopters"". I immediately began to look for a developer's forum just to double check that Astro is programmable and has a few of the features I need for my programming.

I couldn't find ANY information about the robot. I finally stumbled on an Alexa Slack channel and, since the robot works with Alexa, I asked the folks at Amazon for help. It didn't take long to get a reply. Here's what I was told:

>*John, unfortunately, Astro hasn't been released publicly yet, so there's not much documentation or info on exactly how it will work. I can't wait to play with one!*

So they have released an early adopter version of the robot but they have zero support for people who could create content for it (and help it succeed). This is important because Astro doesn't really do too much at the moment. I guess there are some telepresence and home security features, but a mobile robot feels like overkill.

I'm not sure what Amazon is trying to do with this robot. I feel like there have been a dozen of these social robots released (or pitched) and no one was interested in any of them. Cozmo, Jibo, Aibo, Kuri, Pepper, Kiki, Romi Romi, Aniki, and I could go on...

So what's the plan here?"

"How to Get Started in Robotics / Education, Career, and Technical Questions / Wiki Development ThreadHi Everyone, happy 2021 and good riddance to 2020!

We (the moderation team) are working on updating the wiki with better guides and resources. With that in mind, I've put together the wiki in this thread, and would like your help in improving it.

**Please post any robotics questions you have, and any recommended resources, in the comments. They can be career, educational, technical, beginner or expert.** I'll be updating this post based on the comments, so it's a work in progress.

#How to get started in Robotics

### Advice for everyone

This will be difficult. Robotics is the combination of a variety of skills (Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science etc), none of which are easy themselves. 

* **Don't work alone.** We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.

* **Start small.** When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.

* **Do your research.** It will help you make a better robot, it will help you solve problems before you hit them, it will save you money, it will save you time. Especially when you are starting out, every problem you encounter will have been solved by others countless times, and there's probably a great answer to your question online.

* **Document your work.** Keeping a logbook full of notes, diagrams, a to do list, will all help you remember what your were last working on, and help you solve problems. Taking photos and videos will be great for your social media, career portfolio, and are fun to look back on years later.

* **Keep it simple.** 

* **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they can often be expensive, when you need to replace parts.

* **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. 

### Advice for kids (Under 12s) and the grown ups of kids

If your desire is to build robots, you can't go wrong with a [Lego Mindstorms kit](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/robot-inventor-51515). It's expensive, but it lasts for years, there's a massive community behind it, it's compatible with lego, and the [FIRST Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) is a competition designed around it. It's recommended for ages 10+, with support from a parent a younger child could still have fun with it. For younger children, check out the development kits in the resources section. There are kits for younger ages, that are easier to build and program, and others which focus on different robotics skills, such as electronics, mechanics, coding.

We strongly recommend robotics as a group activity for kids. Check out the competitions in the resources section, and talk with your parents and school teachers about starting a club. By working as part of a team you will be more likely to succeed, you will learn more, and have more fun in the process!


### Advice for teenagers

Similar to the advice for kids, we strongly recommend getting involved with a robotics club at your school, or talking to teachers about starting one. Robots are complex and expensive, you'll be able to learn more while having fun if you're part of a team. Take a look at the competitions in the resources section. Competitions are great because they streamline the robot development process, by providing dedicated parts and software, as well as clear rules and objectives for you to work towards. 

If you are looking to build your own robot, please understand that robotics is a multidisciplinary skill, and you shouldn't try to learn all those skills at once. When powering your robot's motors , you *could* learn the electronics and build your own motor driver, *or* you could buy one pre-made online cheaply. The choice you make depends on what you are trying to achieve.

##### Low level hardware control
To build your own robot, start with a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Like the name suggests, a microcontroller is used to control stuff. It can read data from basic sensors, such as buttons, encoders, IMUs, it can control simple things like LEDs, motors, servos, and is programmed in a language close to C++. Using an microcontroller and other cheaply available parts, you can build a two wheeled robot with simple sensors, and then program it to navigate around on the floor. A microcontroller can control stuff easily, but it doesn't have a lot of computing power, so it can't process data from a camera, for example, but (to simplify) the code runs fast.

##### High level hardware control
A microcontroller is great for controlling hardware which doesn't require lot's of computing power, but what about when you do need computing power? What if you want to put a camera on your robot? Answer, you need a computer. More advanced sensors, such as cameras and Lidar use a USB cable and are too complex for you to write all the code needed to use them from scratch, so they come with pre-written code, called a library. OpenCV is a library for computer vision, doing stuff with cameras. The code can be written in C++ or Python (Python is easier). Get yourself a cheap USB camera, install OpenCV, and have a go at using it to [detect colours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html), or [recognise faces](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)

The next step would be to put the camera on your robot, but useless you're building a robot big enough to carry your laptop, we suggest you buy a single board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi. You can connect your microcontroller to your SBC via USB, and then send data and instructions back and forth.

##### Design and build
If you can afford a 3D printer, you should buy one, such as an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer). If you have access to a laser cutting machine at your school, lasercut 3mm plywood is also a cost effective robot construction material. You can also buy construction kits such as [Matrix](https://matrixrobotics.com/product-category/set/) which are expensive, but will last many years.

##### Low level Electronics
You can build great robots using the above skills which are mostly computer science. To take your skills to the next level, learning some basic electronics will allow you to build your own sensors, learning in greater detail how the electronic parts you buy work. You can buy a breadboard and electronics starter kit of parts, to get experimenting with the foundation concepts of electronics. If you find yourself good enough to have a circuit design you want to use on your robot, you can go further and design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using free software such as [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) and then commission them using companies such as [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBtrain](https://www.pcbtrain.co.uk/).


### I want to study robotics at university (Undergraduate Robotics)

##### Pre-requisite maths
There's no way around the fact that mathematics is an integral part of robotics. Robots use mathematics to process the raw data from sensors into valuable data, use data to form an understanding of the world around them, make decisions based on the situation, and then act on them. Fortunately, computers will do all the hard work for you, but you need to understand how the formulas work, and how to apply them. The universities you apply to with prioritize mathematics skills above all else when deciding between applicants.

The mathematics to try and learn before university include: Differentiation and integration, quadratic and polynomial equations, Newtons third law and SUVAT equations of motion, moments, statistical features & probability distributions. These will set you up well for university, if you can handle them with confidence you'll be able to take on the harder stuff as well. You probably won't learn everything, but the more you do, the better.

##### Applying for University
Pure robotics degrees are rare, but increasing in prevalence as the field becomes more important in society, and as more companies seek professional with cross-disciplinary skills. As stated in ""Advice for everyone"", robotics is a combination of different skills. The perfect roboticist would have separate degrees in electronics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, plus a masters in data science, and then all the robotics specific education, plus another masters in the area of robotics they specialize in, such as marine science (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), aerospace engineering (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), or behavioral psychology (Social robots). That's about twelve years of study, excluding industrial placements and internships.

With that in mind, many people choose to study one of the three main disciplines as their undergraduate degree (Electronics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and then transfer into robotics, either with a masters, or straight into industry. Others will study courses similar to robotics (mechatronics, electro-mechanical engineering) and then transfer. These are valid career paths. Pure robotics jobs aren't as common as jobs in electronics, computer science, or mechanical engineering, so if you aren't dead-set on a career in robotics, this path prepares you for a steady career in industry, and you can choose to pursue robotics at a later point in life.

Below is an overview of the key skills that you should expect to learn as part of a university robotics degree. All universities list the course syllabus on their website, giving information about the modules you will study over the years. They might not teach everything here, they might not teach it to the standard you need, they might teach other stuff that is actually more valuable. At this point, it is for you to do your own research. You can always join the [Official Robotics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sbueZeC) and ask for further advice.

# What does it take to become a professional roboticist?

### Basics Skills 

These are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. 

* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics

* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:
    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.

* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.
Tutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !

###Education

* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.

* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.

#Frequently Asked Questions

## How to ask a good question
If you're reading this, it's probably because your question got deleted. It was likely vague, or lacking in prior research.

## What is a Robot?
According to wikipedia ""A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.""

Or put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment, and then acting on them.


## Are Robots going to kill us all?
No, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!


## Why don't robots in real life look like the ones in science fiction?
Science Fiction writers design their robots to be interesting and appealing to people that read their books or watch their movies. They aren't that concerned with how useful the robots are, more with how useful they appear. In contrast, real-world robots are designed to be useful first and foremost, with aesthetics as a secondary consideration. Further, science fiction isn't limited to existing technology. If a motor would need more torque or a battery would need more energy to accomplish a task, a writer can ignore these limitations. In reality, problems like these are at the core of why robots aren't as fast, precise, or cheap as we would want them to be.


## Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?
To para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy
Humans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.

However, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.

## What kinds of questions are asked at a robotics job interview?


--------------------------
--------------------------"
"Human robot interaction (Ameca)Thinking about the Ameca robot just showcased at CES, I think human-robot interaction is an exciting subfield within robotics that will takeoff through the next several years.  I think the rise of social robots like Pepper and Ameca will really help speedup development in this field.

Watching the Ameca robot, I believe most of the interactions were performed by AI, especially when the robot kept repeating the same lines multiple times in different videos.  Selecting a canned line from a human question is not that hard of a problem to program and well within the capabilities of today's AI.  Now I do think some situations were puppeteered by humans, especially the more funny or dynamic interactions or one's that were too stressful for the robot to handle.  But I don't think most of the interactions were staged.  Engineered Arts is a quite capable robotics company that's been developing robots for over a decade.  We can see it in the physical side there was plenty of AI involved where the robot reacted to human hands getting too close to its face.  There's no way that movement was pre-scripted, but it was a response to outside stimuli.  This isn’t just a hardware platform without any AI as some like to claim.  

Now to get back to the topic of human interaction, to me I don't find the physical movements or appearance to be creepy or uncanny.  What I find the most disturbing or uncanny is the verbal interaction where the robot kept explaining it was a robot every other line.  I think there's room for a massive improvement in this area if we actually gave robots personalities and maybe had a realistic backstory as well.  I believe this would greatly improve the interaction people have with robots if they had more realistic personalities.  That's probably not the only way to improve interaction, but this field will keep getting better and better as more and more of these types of social robots are put in realistic situations around people.

"The Future of Digital Assistants Is Queer*AI assistants continue to reinforce sexist stereotypes, but queering these devices could help reimagine their relationship to gender altogether.*

**THIS NOVEMBER, THE** Smithsonian’s FUTURES festival, featuring innovations that are set to change the world, will include a familiar face. Or, rather, voice: Q, introduced in 2019 as the first “genderless AI voice,” is a human voice for use in digital assistants specifically created to be gender-ambiguous.

“Q was designed to start a conversation around why we gender technology when technology has no gender to begin with,” says Ryan Sherman, one of Q’s co-creators. To design the voice, a team of linguists, sound engineers, and creatives collaborated with nonbinary individuals and sampled different voices to land on a sound range they felt had the potential to disrupt the status quo and represent nonbinary people in the world of AI.

When Q was announced several years ago, it was hailed as “[the genderless digital voice the world needs right now](https://www.wired.com/story/the-genderless-digital-voice-the-world-needs-right-now/),” and an acknowledgment of the harm of feminizing assistants, which perpetuates misogynistic stereotypes of women as submissive and obedient. It won praise from a United Nations report on [gender divides in digital skills](https://en.unesco.org/Id-blush-if-I-could). The same report warned that “nearly all of these assistants have been feminized—in name, in voice, in patterns of speech and in personality.” The title of the report—“I’d blush if I could”—was the answer Siri originally provided to users who called it a bitch. (Nowadays, Siri simply replies, “I won’t respond to that.”) In another sign of progress, earlier this year Apple eliminated the default “female” voice for Siri, now including the option for a male voice and allowing US users to choose from a set of voices referred to as voices 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, Google Assistant and Cortana currently let users select a male voice, further proving that companies do respond to public pushback about their products.

Yet uprooting the feminization of digital assistants will take more than just adding a male voice option to the roster. And even the idea of a “genderless AI” voice that registers somewhere between what would be traditionally considered masculine and feminine pitch ranges reveals some of the misconceptions we still confront when thinking about ways to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. In particular, Q might strengthen the outdated belief that nonbinary individuals are neither men nor women, but something in the middle of the binary, rather than outside of it. Instead of striving for “neutrality,” we must reimagine the future of the relationship between digital assistants and gender altogether.

One path forward comes from Yolande Strengers, associate professor of human-centered computing at Monash University and coauthor, with Jenny Kennedy, of *The Smart Wife: Why Siri and Alexa Need a Feminist Reboot*. They don’t think the solution is to remove gender from the equation altogether, because “this oversimplifies the ways in which these devices treat gender, which are not only gendered by voice, but by the types of things that they say, their personalities, their form, and their purpose,” Strengers says. Instead, they propose queering the smart wife so that digital assistants may exist in defiance of gender stereotypes.

Queering the smart wife could mean, in its simplest form, affording digital assistants different personalities that more accurately represent the many versions of femininity that exist around the world, as opposed to the pleasing, subservient personality that many companies have chosen to adopt.

Q would be a fair case of what queering these devices could look like, Strengers adds, “but that can’t be the only solution.” Another option could be bringing in masculinity in different ways. One example might be Pepper, a humanoid robot developed by Softbank Robotics that is often ascribed he/him pronouns, and is able to recognize faces and basic human emotions. Or Jibo, another robot, introduced back in 2017, that also used masculine pronouns and was marketed as a social robot for the home, though it has since been given a second life as a device focused on health care and education. Given the “gentle and effeminate” masculinity performed by Pepper and Jibo—for instance, the first responds to questions in a polite manner and frequently offers flirtatious looks, and the latter often swiveled whimsically and approached users with an endearing demeanor—Strengers and Kennedy see them as positive steps in the right direction.

Queering digital assistants could also result in creating bot personalities to replace humanized notions of technology. When Eno, the Capital One baking robot launched in 2019, is asked about its gender, it will playfully reply: “I’m binary. I don’t mean I’m both, I mean I’m actually just ones and zeroes. Think of me as a bot.”

Similarly, Kai, an online banking chatbot developed by Kasisto—an organization that builds AI software for online banking—abandons human characteristics altogether. Jacqueline Feldman, the Massachusetts-based writer and UX designer who created Kai, explained that the bot “was designed to be genderless.” Not by assuming a nonbinary identity, as Q does, but rather by assuming a robot-specific identity and using “it” pronouns. “From my perspective as a designer, a bot could be beautifully designed and charming in new ways that are specific to the bot, without it pretending to be human,” she says.

When asked if it was a real person, Kai would say, “A bot is a bot is a bot. Next question, please,” clearly signaling to users that it wasn’t human nor pretending to be. And if asked about gender, it would answer, “As a bot, I’m not a human. But I learn. That’s machine learning.”

"A hobby project that helps me with my Crohn's DiseaseHi,

I hope this is OK to post here and isn't considered ""blogspam"" or anything like that. I've had Crohn's for almost 13 years now and lately I've been working on my own [robotics project](https://imtoospexy.com/blog/projects/) as a way to raise awareness of Crohn's Disease and as ""therapy"" I guess because Crohn's really put a detour in the course of my life (as I'm sure it has to a lot of you here).

It started out as a way to manage my medication by reminding what I have to take, when to take it and I programmed in behaviours that the robot would get ""angry"", ""sad"" and celebrate with me.

Most recently I built a prototype that creates a [multiple choice game](https://imtoospexy.com/blog/social-robot-crohns-quiz) based off my current prescription and my own medical data.

I've realised there a lot more possibilities and I'm hoping to keep building on it."

Smart, interactive, and uniquely mobile, Aido is the first social robot that can move around your home/office to help improve your lifestyle."
"I personally don't think anyone should study old school pick-up like 'The Game' by Neil Strauss, Mystery Method, etc. They may have played a role in shaping modern dating advice. But they are not useful anymore. I feel they were 'growing pains', or an early prototype, that can now be discarded.I think they should be avoided because they make a lot of guys worse. 

Some modern dating gurus might have been influenced to start approaching a lot because of old school pick-up. People like Mark Manson, James Marshall, etc, took this area of their life more seriously because of it. Then they realized it wasn't the most effective way and denounced it, and told guys not to follow it.

Then they created their own philosophy, which can be called the second wave of pick-up. So I'm not saying the first wave was completely useless. It played a role. 

One dating coach in my city (he's a small coach, not YouTube famous), who teaches self-development and improvement as the way to attract girls, said he started out with Mystery Method, then saw it had problems so stopped using it and switched to natural game. I assume it's the same with other dating coaches (that started learning to communicate with girls in the 2000 to 2010 period), they were inspired to take action by old school pick-up. Their action led to their epiphanies, which created the new movement.

And these coaches then influenced younger dating coaches who don't study old school pick-up, which I think is good. I once spoke on Facebook to a dating coach who was 22 years old and had studied from other dating coaches, and he didn't know what 'The Game' or Mystery Method was. I also saw a video by Kezia Noble a few weeks ago, where she said most of her students had never heard of 'The Game' and she called it a new generation. 

I feel the old movement is being forgotten about, and I think that's good.

Like how the horse carriage (with wheels) was created before the car, and that may have helped inspire the creation of the car (with wheels). But we wouldn't use a horse carriage today. We have cars, trucks, etc. I realize this wasn't the best example, it's just something I thought of in the moment. But it illustrates my point. When a stepping stone has played its role, there is no point carrying it around anymore.

For those who claim old school doesn't make every guy worse, I want to say that it makes enough guys worse that it justifies being avoided. Strauss himself wrote about this in The Game, writing that article on 'social robots', and in his book points out that a lot of the guys didn't even spend time with girls, and some guys had mental breakdowns. The entire book was a warning not to follow that road, and Strauss concluded the book by leaving the community and wrote of all the others who left.

I made this post because I worry about some new guys who will study the old stuff, not realizing things have evolved and there are better ways. There are much better books like 'Models' by Mark Manson, '3% Man' by Corey Wayne, 'As You Are' by Nick Sparks, etc.

The old stuff are not used anymore and being forgotten for a reason."

"BridgesI read /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit's sweet meditation on how small things can bridge the gaps between us - a shower, [a bowl of water](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/ga2934/a_bowl_of_water/), an apple... And yet again, my comment grew into it's own story. He's done that to me before - he's a very low-keyed writer about high-keyed situations. Me, I like reading about bridges between cultures, but I'm one of those people who stares into the abyss under the bridge. Never going to Royal Gorge again - you can see all the way down between gaps in the bridge deck. Speaking of gaps:

# Bridges

**Rats**

I was stuck in an old, concrete French bunker 10 clicks south of the DMZ at Dong Ha in late 1968. It was just me and two South Vietnamese *pháo binh* (artillery) officers, a young *Thiếu Úy* (2nd Lieutenant) and an OLD *Trung Úy* (1st Lieutenant).  I dunno, hard to tell with Asians - but either he was pushing 50 or he'd had a hard life, maybe both. We were clearing fires between our Area of Operation (AO) and the Marines to the left and right of us.

We were living in downtown Dong Ha in an old French base that was HQ for a reinforced regiment (soon to be a division) of ARVNs, the South Vietnamese Army, but was most memorably the home of about 20,000 hairy-tailed Vietnamese rats. The rats helped us bond - rat-watch is serious business.

When I finally left Dong Ha, I had to shake two momma rats out of the two fuzzy metal-one-quart canteen covers attached to my butt pack. I turned the whole assembly over to my battery Supply Sergeant at Quang Tri, and told him about the previous tenants - one mamma left some little squirmy rat-babies behind. I had shaken it out, but they were sticky little buggers. Might have missed one.

The Supply Sergeant edged away from me far enough to establish a ""social distance"" between us, put on gloves and carried the nasty pack to the burn pit. Told me it was a ""combat loss."" In a way. Fine by me.

Sorry. Got carried away by rat hate. Back to Dong Ha.

**Face to Face**

We all got along in the bunker. The *Thiếu Úy*'s English was pretty good. And he could put on an American-face without too much effort.

Hard to explain the concept of ""face"" - I'm not sure I fully understood it anyway. The short definition of ""face"" was the process of maintaining personal dignity, not showing any emotion in front of strangers. Or friends either - not in public anyway. People who grinned and laughed a lot in public or private were considered idiotic, mentally deranged in an offensive way. Fools with no personal pride in themselves.

So yeah, Americans looked like fools and idiots to them. Which was a problem. We were *very* loud, laughed and talked alla damned time, didn't seem to care what others thought. Even the officers seemed to have no self-respect. And that sunny American countenance was, to the Vietnamese, also insulting. If you weren't a fool or an idiot, then you were treating *them* with disrespect by acting like a fool right in front of them.

I'm making it more of a problem than it was. We weren't social robots. We all knew that there were different people in different lands with different customs. Nobody was a fool or an idiot here. No one was being insulted. We were doing the best we could. We were a tight little fire-clearing machine.

The *Trung Úy* was old-school. His French was excellent - English, not so much. Language skills are almost archeological - you can tell how old somebody is by his acquired language skills. The *Trung Úy* was old enough to be out of his element. You have to notice and respect that. My French was laughable - he almost laughed a couple of times. I could see it in his eyes - I took it as a compliment. I just grinned at him like an idiot. We got along. Had to. We were in that bunker on 12 hour shifts.

**Jersey Shore**

In late 1968, the USS New Jersey showed up right offshore from the DMZ. The NJ was an Iowa-class battleship, the last of the WWII vintage still in service. It took up the job of cleaning out all the North Vietnamese artillery positions north of the DMZ. Lovely beast. I had posted a picture of it lifted from *Stars & Stripes* under the glass on one of our desktops. Both Vietnamese lieutenants gave it a look, but weren't that impressed.

Something came up late one afternoon. The Marine Amphibs on the *Của Việt* to our east had a fire mission plotted about 800 meters away from one of our infantry patrols. Normally, I'd clear that easy peasy, but they wanted to use the New Jersey. I called the *Trung Úy* up to the map. ""*Hải pháo* (navy guns), shoot here."" He squinted at the map, got out a little ruler, looked at me like WTF, and said, ""Yah. Shoot.""

I wasn't sure he understood me. I said, ""*Hải pháo*"" again. ""Yah yah, *shoot*!"" he said. I picked up a paper and pen, wrote ""406 mm,"" on the paper and said ""*Hải pháo*,"" again. He parsed it out. ""Four. Zero. Six. Millimetre?"" I nodded. His eyes got wide. ""NO shoot!""

No shit, no shoot. I called off the dogs. The Amphibs weren't in contact or anything. Call me back with a smaller caliber. That ship has 5"" guns, too.

The *Thiếu Úy* had watched the whole thing. He looked at me, made his eyes wide, and said ""NO shoot!"" The *Trung Úy* put his hand over his mouth and made a snurking noise trying to stifle a laugh. Which set off me and the *Thiếu Úy*.  The *Trung Úy* kept his hand over his mouth, but he was laughing until he had tears in his eyes. Clearly, he wasn't used to doing that. But it was a good thing, anyway. Good for the team. We'll make our own face, thankyouverymuch.

**Speaking American**

We did, too. Wasn't as much fun as I thought. Shortly thereafter, there was planning for a big operation. The *Đại Tá* (Colonel) commanding the regiment was on his way to being a general officer in charge of the 3rd ARVN Infantry Division, which is what our regiment was being beefed up to become. The *Đại Tá* had mastered colloquial American English. His American-face was perfect.

We were invited to a meeting of all the ARVN, Marine and Army officers who were going to be part of this multi-national operation to sweep some part of the DMZ. The *Đại Tá* was in charge, and he was introducing people all around, laughing and smiling and cracking jokes.

He came to us: ""This is our artillery liaison unit."" He called us by name. Then he said something like, ""They will check all artillery fires to make sure we don't end up shooting at each other."" He made an alarmed face. Big laugh. ""So if you need artillery clearance, these are the men you should call."" He added more detail about that. Then he said, ""But if you have any questions about anything else, don't call them. They are only Lieutenants."" Another big laugh. I smiled. ""Call our \[Vietnamese words for Operations - S3- TOC\].""

**Dishonor**

When we got back to our bunker, the *Trung Úy* disappeared. Then he came back and called the *Thiếu Úy* out of the bunker. Then they both came back, and the *Thiếu Úy* said. ""*Trung Úy* would like you to repeat what the *Đại Tá* said when he pointed to us. He talked too fast in English to understand.""

Well fuck. He had said we ""were only Lieutenants."" He had made the Americans laugh at us. And they did, they laughed at us. And suddenly I looked down from the bridge of friendship and stolen laughter that connected us, and saw a chasm, thousands of years deep. Shit.

""He was joking with the Americans, "" I said, ""He didn't mean disrespect. Americans are like that."" The *Thiếu Úy* translated - the *Trung Úy* was in no mood to try to use his English, but he heard that. ""Disrespect. Dishonor,"" he said. Then he left the room. ""He is going to see the *Đại Tá*, "" said the *Thiếu Úy*. He was in tears. I felt like throwing up. Crap. This was NOT going to turn out well.

We should've had more faith in the *Đại Tá*. The guy was a good commander, but he was a better politician. He was set to be the new commanding general of a new division, and he was going to need senior officers of some experience. And his officers needed to be loyal. To him. He didn't miss the opportunity.

After a couple of hours, the *Trung Úy* came back to our bunker. I knew this because the *Thiếu Úy* jumped up and saluted as he yelled ""*Đại Úy*! (Captain!), Wut? I turned around, then did the same thing. There was the no-longer-*Trung Úy* standing there with Captain's insignia. He looked grim-faced as he returned our salutes. The *Thiếu Úy* was trying to keep a straight face, but y'know, I was an American.

I was grinning like a fuckin' idiot.

**Addendum**

You gotta love happy endings, but this story doesn't have one. The 3rd ARVN Division came into being, and held the same AO on Highway 1, just south of the DMZ until Spring of 1972. They disintegrated in the face of the massive NVA offensive across the DMZ and down to Quang Tri. Don't know what happened to my friends. Don't have too much to say about it, but that fact seasons this story for me."

"From Roombas to Rosie – Engineering Domestic RobotsProving that our distaste for household chores knows no bounds, people have been dreaming about robots that can do our housework for more than half a century.

From Rosie the Robot, who served the Jetsons, to Bender in Futurama, domestic robots have long been a mainstay of science fiction. Until recently, such autonomous and interactive robots were confined to the realm of imagination.

The majority of domestic robots that have made their way into our homes so far are relatively “mindless” creations designed to perform a single function. The most ubiquitous example is the robotic vacuum cleaner, which has been patrolling floors around the world. Joining Roomba has been an array of one-hit wonders designed to do things like mop floors, fold our clothes, clean the cat litter box, mow our lawns and clean our swimming pools.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of more intelligent domestic robots that have the capacity to do multiple tasks and learn as they go. But there are still plenty of engineering hurdles to overcome on the way to creating a true Rosie: a robot that can do all your household chores, take care of the kids and even crack a joke to cheer you up when you’re having a bad day.

A lot of progress has been made, and some pretty clever robots are on their way to our homes in the next few years, but there are plenty of engineering challenges remaining on the road to building a personal domestic [Aido Social Robot](https://goinggreenshow.com/2020/10/21/ai-technology-leading-to-100-million-evaluation/).

Human-Machine Interactions – Developing People Skills

It’s hard enough for us to understand each other, so making a machine that can navigate the complexities of human interaction is no easy task. However, if you want a robot that can not only take directions but anticipate your needs as well, enhancing human-machine interactions is a necessity.

The rise of  brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Is granting us the ability to give instructions to machines in new ways, but the path forward for domestic robots calls for machines that can understand our needs and interact with us using natural language.

We can already control machines to some extent using voice commands, as evidenced by the speech recognition capacities of programs like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. But, as the IEEE points out, proper autonomous robots need to go one step further, to the point where they can understand the nuances of human behavior and establish meaningful connections the same way we do with each other.

In other words, domestic robots (at least the kind you’d be willing to trust with your kids) need to have empathy. Researchers are hard at work on natural language processing and human-machine interactions—with some interesting results already—but the technology still has a ways to go.

Navigating Human Environments

As researchers at Stanford University have pointed out, today’s robots perform best when doing repetitive jobs like grasping and moving objects. Moreover, controlled environments like factories are well-suited to robotic automation.

However, as anyone who has had young children can attest, a household environment tends to be about as far from controlled as you can get. Our homes involve far too many variables to preprogram a robot that can deal with them all. These includes people and possibly pets moving around in spaces that are optimized for humans, not robots.

Add to that the fact that the environment can change without notice—for example, when remodelling—and it’s clear that successful domestic robots will need to be highly adaptive. The Stanford paper breaks the challenge of navigating a human environment down into five categories: perception, learning, working with people, platform design and control.

Researchers and engineers around the world are currently working on projects designed to overcome each of these individual challenges, but the ultimate challenge lies in finding a way to integrate the approaches into functional systems that will work for robots operating in the real world.

Reducing Sensor Costs

Just as buying a home computer in the ‘80s wasn’t financially practical for most people, a key challenge to any up-and-coming modern technology is cost. Although the costs may have come down in the last few years, many of today’s robots still aren’t cheap.

One of the reasons for this is that in order to successfully navigate its environment, a robot needs a whole array of sensors that are currently expensive to manufacture. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has brought down the cost of inertial sensors in recent years, but other sensing technologies like LiDAR are still fairly expensive.

Bringing domestic robots into the average home means bringing those costs down. Fortunately, recent interest in autonomous vehicle technology has spurred electronics manufacturers to find ways to produce LiDAR systems as lower costs. for example, has developed a proprietary solid-state LiDAR technology to cope with navigating densely populated urban areas. This could help reduce the cost of LiDAR, but that alone may not be sufficient to make domestic robots a more affordable proposition.

Domestic Robots Today

While our very own Rosie the Robot might still be out of reach from both engineering and financial perspectives, autonomous helper robots are starting to become a reality.

Take Zenbo by ASUS, for example. Announced in spring of 2016 with a price tag of $599 USD, Zenbo is branded as “your smart little companion” by its creators.

The company provided little in the way of technical details about the robot when it was released, but according to the demonstration, it’s packing at least one camera, speakers, a microphone and some kind of wireless connectivity.

In terms of what it can do, the video accompanying the announcement suggests that it’s not much help in the realm of practical household chores. It’s essentially a “tablet on wheels” that can take pictures, recognize voice commands, answer questions and control smart home devices.

There are a whole host of other interactive robotic devices like Zenbo being launched, which seem mainly designed to manage the parts of our lives connected to devices.

Then there’s an interactive “social family [Aido Home Robot](https://interestingengineering.com/9-ways-artificial-intelligence-can-help-make-your-time-at-home-more-fun)” that’s designed to play with your kids, help with household chores, handle your schedule and keep your home connected and safe. The only kicker is that it’s still in development.

Palo Alto-based Ingen Dynamics announced Aido in early 2016 with the launch of an Indiegogo campaign, with the plan to start shipping by the end of the year. As of this writing, after a raising $850,000 through crowdfunding, the company has so far only revealed the core functionality of the cute little robot in a prototype video released for early backers and investors.

At a cost of $1,200 per unit, Aido is not cheap. But if it really can do everything its creators claim, from helping you do yoga to playing with your kids—all while gliding around your house quietly on a ball—some people might see it as worth the investment.

Regardless of which venture you think has the best chance of being the iPhone of domestic robots, you can bet that someone is going claim that title. The spread of automation isn’t going to stop at your doorstep, even though there are still many engineering challenges to overcome.

Whether it’s a matter of building a better human-machine interface, finding more efficient ways to navigate unpredictable environments, reducing the cost of sensors, or more fine-grained problems like developing the necessary actuators and end effectors, Rosie is undoubtedly on her way.

What do you see as the biggest engineering challenge for domestic robots?"
"Why do I not feel any euphoria on Adderall?Diagnosed with ADHD combined type, but leaning more towards the hyperactive side; prescribed Adderall 10mg IR x2 a day.

Why do I never get ""amped up"" from Adderall or any of its amphetamine derivatives? My Adderall dose makes me really tired and annoyed that all I can do is focus on my work. It kills my otherwise hyperactive and outgoing personality, and turns me into a grumpy yet productive mess. I initially thought my dose was a little too low, but higher doses turn me into an anti-social robot.

I was on Modafinil (off-label) for ADHD, and it got me really euphoric and energetic — making it the perfect drug for everyday interactions. Sure it doesn't come close to Adderall when it comes to helping with my focus for cognition-heavy tasks related to my work, but this makes me wonder why I never get any euphoria or burst of energy from Adderall that most people talk about. 

Could this be because I might have something like sleep apnea on the side with ADHD, and Adderall doesn't really help with sleep-related fatigue, but Modafinil does?"

"Please help! I'm tripping and I can't come down!Hey guys, I'm a pretty new at all this (only smoked a handful of times over the past 6 months or so, most the time with vaporizers and once with a pipe).

I'm just writing because I'm kinda freaking out right now. 

Ok so my friend's roommate sold us some weed and said we could use his friend's vaporizer. It looked and smelled (from what I've been taught) to be pretty good stuff. Both me and my friend are pretty new at this, but I'd done it before so that seemed to be all chill and stuff.

So we smoke. Probably WAY TOO MUCH, but that's because we didn't know how much to take. His roommate says ""till you're high"" Thanks. So I start freaking out because I'm getting what I've variously called a ""strobe light effect"" ""a sensation cascade"" and ""feeling each nerve fire."" Basically whenever I get too many sensations at once (especially triggered by temperature; the next strongest is texture), I feel this kind of frame-by-frame, like I'm missing stuff in between... or like each millisecond takes 2 milliseconds, so there is an overlap of sensation. Or like my brain is taking time to catch up with the changing environment. Whatever it is, it's overpowering. 
So I kind of freaked out that time, but then I went to bed to make it go away. The next day I started getting the feeling again, but that afternoon I napped again and was fine.

I thought that maybe it was because I hadn't eaten right that day, and I was really tired on top of it. 

So this past weekend (several weeks after the above occurrence) we go for it again, but I make sure to be rested and have eaten well beforehand. 
We take a lot less this time; I took about 4 tokes from the vaporizer.
I'm cool and chill for about 5 minutes, and then it starts happening again. It's not so bad at first but then it gets stronger and stronger and I just decide to go to bed again because I can't take it anymore. I wake up the next day and am still feeling it. I'm totally out of it and fucked up all day, then I go to bed again hoping it'll get better. I wake up today and I'm still weirded out. I still get the sensation (but not as often) and it's making it impossible to get any of my shit done. It's also scary. 

It's been over 60 hours (2.5 days) and I'm still not recovered. I searched online for ways to help come down and none of them helped (exercise, eating, sleeping, sex, shower and time). 

We were using a Fuzion VP-100, and the piping was pretty dirty because the filter on the filling side is kind of shaky (only connected in certain parts, can turn) so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Both times were from the same stash too, which looks like good stuff but according to my friends roommate its ""kinda old/stale""

I never had this kind of bad reaction any of the other times I smoked/vap'ed, and my friend didn't have a bad reaction at all. The other times were all with different vaporizers or a pipe, and different stashes. 

I don't know what to do, I am so sick of the feeling, and it's starting to make me really worried that something is seriously wrong with me. I'd also really like to come down soon because I have an exam in 3.5 hours.


Have any of you encountered this feeling before? Any idea what's happening or what's wrong; any way I can change things to make it ok to vap?
Also any recommendations for coming down would be well appreciated. 

Thanks friends.

tl;dr: I'm getting a weird frame-by-frame over-sensitivity trip that's been going on for 2.5 days after vape'ing a normal amount. Why is it happening and how can I come down in time for my exam this afternoon?"

"Game Mechanics that Lie""[I like the idea that an objective marker can lie](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14jlmo/which_games_does_exploration_in_a_right_way/c7dqt3a).""

I wrote that in response to someone describing a certain scene in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  That wasn't actually a lying objective marker, but rather showing choices to the player.  However, the comment got a surprising number of upvotes.

I've been toying with a concept of an AI gone wrong, in a world where everyone's tied together and an AR UI is the norm.  Cyberpunk world.  We already depend on smartphones for a lot in our lives - from scheduling to organizing.  Some people are already using cameras to record constant memories to a cloud.  Something like Google Glasses is toying with the idea of bring that sort of UI to life.  Human function is going out there, and no longer internalized in the imperfect machine that is humanity.

Anyway, part of the idea involved networking everyone together as we are already via smartphones and social networks.  The concept of the ""game"" is that the very UI you depend on is lying to you.  You'd have to figure it out as a player, but I'm imagining how that could even work.  

What would you picture as a consequence of this.  Would you feel betrayed or wowed by such a revelation?  Would you prefer it to be subtle or not?

I'm thinking of making a short prototype together in a few months (likely with UDK with the included assets).  Something like The Stanley Parable, in which someone is going through a routine job that goes very, very, wrong.  Or a murder mystery in which the helpful UI is less than helpful.

I'd like to know r/truegaming's thoughts on it.

Edit: I'm getting great feedback, as well as examples from games that already do this.  So let's broaden this a bit - 

What do you feel is useful information in a UI, that you trust implicitly as a gamer?

Edit 2: [I suppose I should share where some of the inspiration comes from](https://vimeo.com/52779714).

Also, Yahtzee had a [Survival on a Cruise Ship](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9423-Survival-Horror-on-a-Cruise-Ship) idea with the UI as an interactive element.

People have recommended Dark Souls (in which other players generate griefing ""hints""), Portal (and 2), Dead Space 2, Black Ops 2 (has portions where you could choose not to follow orders), LOVED, Depict1, and I wanna Be The Guy as examples of lying where players would normally follow.

Edit 3: Found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAMR7F47oBc&feature=player_embedded) on the front page and started to think of this UI as a ""social robot"" of a sort."

"Science AMA Series: I'm Nadia Thalmann, head of the MIRALab Research Lab at the University of Geneva, chair the Institute for Media Innovation in Singapore at NTU, and Editor-in-Chief of Springer’s The Visual Computer. I led development of Nadine, one of the most realistic robots in the world. AMA!Hi reddit!
I am a very interdisciplinary researcher working with Virtual Characters and social robots. I like to model human behaviour as recognition of gestures and faces, and simulating natural reactions. My dream is to have a virtual coach that could help me in many situations (personal assistant). I also work for creating 3D virtual worlds, where we can see ancient decors and interact with ancient people. I am also interested in the medical field. I work with medical doctors and patients for simulating articulations. All my research can be seen on www.miralab.ch.

For the Social robot Nadine, I was always interested in automaton. They were automatic machines that followed a sequence of predefined actions. With Nadine, the social robot, we can now create more autonomy and adaptation through the interaction. A lot of people have reacted to the fact that Nadine looks like a real person. Some of them like it, some others find it scary. For me, she looks quite natural.
I would be happy to give more information or answer questions to anyone interested.

**I’ll be back at 6 pm EST (3 pm PST, 11 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!**"
"I am philosopher Shannon Vallor - AMA about philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies!**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**


I am [Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/), the William J. Rewak S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, where I have taught since 2003. 

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay); I worked full-time during my college years at a Cal State university, going to school for a Psychology degree, mostly at night. Like many undergrads, I had no particular interest in or understanding of philosophy until I happened to take an evening course in the Fall of my junior year that satisfied a general ed requirement for the B.A.: a course in applied ethics. Something clicked immediately and forcefully.  I upended my entire life to switch over to a philosophy major, taking negotiated breaks from my job to drive to the required PHIL courses offered only during the day, and then going back to work until late evenings to make up the time. My focus as an undergrad was eclectic; philosophy of science and Husserlian phenomenology consumed me the most. I knew grad school was what I wanted, but to get there I had to ignore the warnings of several senior faculty who advised me kindly but firmly that: A) one simply does not go to grad school to study philosophy of science AND phenomenology, as these are mutually exclusive intellectual passions; and B) one definitely does not try to do so as a woman graduating from what is essentially a commuter university, because you have two strikes against you already. 

With the help of luck, pigheadedness, and some very opportune GRE scores, I managed to worm my way into the Ph.D. program at Boston College, where I thrived. Most fortunate of all was my discovery of a mentor in Richard Cobb-Stevens, possibly the kindest soul I have ever met, and one of the few I could have found who wrote on Husserl and analytic philosophy. He wholeheartedly encouraged my disdain for the arbitrary constraints of the analytic/continental ‘divide.’ I also managed to get a fine education in the philosophy and history of science from I.B. Cohen, who was in the habit of crossing the river from Harvard to teach grad seminars at BC. Virtue ethics was a brand new passion I picked up in grad school. And while I could never make myself love Heidegger the way Bill Richardson wanted me to, I did manage to pick up an interest in the philosophy of technology through a seminar he taught that explored Heidegger’s influence on that field.

I wrote my dissertation on the philosophy of reference in Husserl and the analytic tradition; I was interested in how the former could address some of the challenges of the latter, and I thought this had significant implications for referential practices, ontology and realism in science. I published two pieces from the dissertation in relatively obscure venues (later discovering that one of them somehow made its way into a graduate linguistics course at Stony Brook). Later, I published an article in Inquiry of which I was quite proud, engaging the debate between van Fraassen and Hacking on instrumental realism and scientific ‘unobservables’ from a phenomenological perspective. Another article in Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences took on Dennett’s abuses of phenomenology and the notion of scientific evidence. But once I started on the tenure-track teaching the philosophy of science at Santa Clara University, I quickly realized that trying to publish at the intersections of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of language or science meant fighting a very strong current. Most journals sent back my work without review, saying either that they didn’t publish ‘continental’ work, or that they published only continental work. 

Around the same time, in 2007, I had started teaching a new undergrad course called “Science, Technology and Society,” into which I drew a great deal of philosophy of technology, and some applied ethics. I was dumbfounded by the enthusiastic response of my students, who acted like they had been stranded in the desert and I had just shown up with a water fountain. They were dealing with the advent of smartphones, Facebook, and other new social media, and their relationships and habits were changing in ways they could not fully articulate, but knew were ethically, politically and epistemically transformative. I decided to write something about how new social media were reshaping our communicative habits, and thus almost certainly our communicative virtues and vices. I presented it at a workshop on technology and the ‘good life’ in the Netherlands, where advanced research in technology ethics abounds, and found that my work also resonated among the scholars there; soon after, philosophers and ethicists of technology became my primary research community. 

This was not only for pragmatic, selfish reasons. While I did benefit, tenure-wise, from having a new group of journals that were happy to publish the new kind of work I was doing, I also recognized that my research in the ethics of emerging technologies was of far more immediate social and political importance than the sort of research I had been doing. I told myself that I could return to my phenomenological and epistemological fascinations at any time (and I still do dabble in them), but I reasoned that work on the ethical impact of new media, military and social robotics, artificial intelligence, biomedical enhancement, and pervasive digital surveillance needed to be done now, by as many good philosophers as are equipped and motivated to take it on. Almost a decade has passed since I made that decision, and time has not proved me wrong. As the current President of the [Society for Philosophy and Technology](http://www.spt.org/), Executive Board member of the [Foundation for Responsible Robotics](http://responsiblerobotics.org/), and member of the [IEEE Standards Association’s Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in the Design of Autonomous Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html), I have watched the international demand for rigorous research in this area explode.

And yet, philosophy and ethics of technology remains a relatively under-studied and undervalued field in the United States. The problem is not one of social need or interest; being in Silicon Valley, I and many of my peers are invited to speak to policymakers, tech companies and professional groups of software developers, roboticists, and engineers more often than our schedules permit. Yet philosophy departments in the U.S. still employ very few philosophers of technology and tech ethicists, and even fewer in top research positions. In Europe and the U.K., the situation is significantly better, and my research has benefited greatly from a strong network of good friends and research partners in those countries.

I have also been fortunate enough to enter into a great relationship with Oxford University Press, who last year published my first book, the culmination of almost a decade of research into virtue ethics as a normative framework for thinking about emerging technologies: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&). In the first part of the book, I make the case for virtue ethics as the richest and most adaptable normative framework for crafting a set of global norms and practices that will permit the human family to survive and flourish with new technologies. In the second part of the book, I give the reader a brief tour of the fundamental moral practices of self-cultivation found in three distinct classical virtue traditions: Aristotelian ethics, Confucian ethics and Buddhist ethics, and I show how these practices today can support the contemporary need to cultivate what I call the technomoral virtues. These are virtues of moral character and intelligence that are specifically adapted to the needs of living well with emerging technologies, and to coping with the increasing complexity and opacity of the technosocial future that poses such an acute epistemic challenge to practical wisdom. In the third part of the book, I apply the framework developed in Part Three to four specific domains of emerging technology: new social media, pervasive digital surveillance and self-tracking, military and social robotics, and biomedical human enhancement. The aim of the book is to highlight a practical path to cultivating the technomoral wisdom that can give the human family its best shot at continued flourishing on this planet.

Since the book was written, my work has focused more narrowly on the ethical implications of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. I am happy to have a co-authored chapter with computer scientist George Bekey coming out in a new version of the stellar Robot Ethics volume being edited by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney and Ryan Jenkins, and my next book will devote significant attention to artificial intelligence and its ethical and political implications. I am also increasingly interested in the immense challenges and opportunities that emerging technologies present for the cultivation of civic virtues, and for the democratic flourishing those virtues enable. While the civic virtues of ‘public character’ received significant attention in my first book, I underestimated how quickly our growing deficit of public character would endanger our democratic institutions and our liberties. I expect to be thinking through these challenges for many years to come.

My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

"UAT Provides New Community Scholarship for Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater ScottsdaleWe’re excited to announce our new University of Advancing Technology (UAT) Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale ([BGCS](https://bgcs.org/)) Community Scholarship. Any high school junior or senior who has attended one of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale clubs is eligible (along with proof of high school graduation or GED, as well as acceptance by UAT).

The BGCS Scholarship award is a one-half tuition scholarship to be credited evenly over 8 consecutive semesters or 4 academic years, for a total amount of approximately $50,000. Scholarship recipient(s) must attend on campus, and those who meet award maintenance requirements will receive the scholarship for up to 8 academic semesters.

Valerie Cimarossa, UAT’s Vice President of Marketing and Technology, feels that the partnership is a perfect fit for UAT’s tech-centric curriculum. “We are always looking for every opportunity to show young people that an education and a career in technology is a viable (and an awesome) choice.”

Last November, BGCS opened the [Ellie & Michael Ziegler STEAM Makerspace Studio](https://bgcs.org/news/ellie-michael-ziegler-steam-makerspace-studio-opens-in-boys-girls-clubs-of-greater-scottsdale-virginia-g-piper-branch/) inside the Virginia G. Piper clubhouse. At this Makerspace, Club members have access to specialized STEAM programming beyond the K-12 education system. “When BGCS first invited us to join their Makerspace Committee,” Cimarossa said, “we knew the natural next step was to provide an opportunity for these students to begin exploring a career in the technology BGCS had exposed them to.”

That step is the new UAT scholarship.  

We spoke to Dr. Donna Jagielski, Director of STEAM Makerspace Programs for BGCS, about how they are utilizing tech in their clubs and how students can participate.

**What is the importance of STEAM education in your clubs?**

*At Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale we are committed to inspiring youth and teens in STEAM-related fields to prepare them for Arizona careers of today and tomorrow.*

*In our Clubs,* [*STEAM*](https://www.uattech.com/programming-a-social-robot-to-help-around-campus) *is all about making a positive impact and being a changemaker through innovation. You have to be willing to rock the boat sometimes if you want to make a difference. Change is not always comfortable, but it is a necessary ingredient to move forward.*

*Our STEAM and Makerspace programming provides the development of that mindset through our organized programming, meeting youth/teens where they are and providing them with and teaching them to use cutting-edge technologies as their tools to make it happen.*

**What does the STEAM and Makerspace Program entail?**

*Our STEAM and* [*Makerspace*](https://www.uattech.com/trend-setting-students-and-next-gen-robotics) *programming introduces youth and teens to a balance of organized programming and opportunities for open/free exploration of their individual interests and the freedom to seek answers to their own questions using cutting-edge tools.*

*Our Club members are encouraged to take risks in voicing ideas and “failing forward,” cultivating self-efficacy and thus empowering our youth and teens with the knowledge that they CAN be changemakers.*

*It was important to me when designing our programming that the environment was one that is safe and supportive for our members to explore their interests with our guidance, yet without the influence of our own ideas.*

**How can students participate in the STEAM Makerspace Studio?**

*All of our Club members (K-12th grade) have access to our Studios and STEAM Makerspace programming, allowing them to participate in organized programming and to develop their own* [*projects*](https://www.uattech.com/tech-talent-for-rent) *as they pursue their own interests.*

*This past February, teens from our Virginia G. Piper Branch participated in the University of Arizona Connect2STEM and SciTech Festival with their own livestream event from our Makerspace Studio. These teens highlighted innovation with drones to design, test and complete a successful delivery mechanism.*

*We are planning for a variety of engaging opportunities for our members to be challenged and inspired.*

**How do you encourage students to pursue STEAM professions?**

*Our programming facilitates the development of a “maker mindset” and global thinking to help our members become agile and nimble with the understanding that most likely the job they will find themselves in has not yet been created. We encourage respect and collaboration, and at the same time help members develop a hard shell for criticism. Additionally, we focus on:*

* *Developing and striking a balance between both right and left sides of the brain*
* *STEM/STEAM mirrors real life and we help members identify that it is interwoven in everyday life and activities*

**How has UAT’s contributions to the development of your maker spaces been helpful?**

*From the inception of our STEAM Makerspace project, UAT has been by our side every step of the way, providing guidance and access to* [*resources*](https://www.uattech.com/uats-contributions-to-the-local-stem-ecosystem) *to ensure that we are indeed providing our members with world-class STEAM opportunities. UAT has also provided us with desktop computers that we use as part of our VR area.*

*And now, we are blown away with this new opportunity for our members to receive scholarships for tuition to UAT.*

**What does a UAT scholarship mean for your students?**

*Through this partnership, our Club members will be able to continue following their passions for STEAM learning as they continue on into post-secondary learning. UAT’s innovative degree programs will provide our members with cutting edge learning to prepare them to be our next STEM industry leaders.*

"Is there a way to modify my Furby Boom, so it uses a Li-Ion (cellular) battery or any other power source instead of AA batteries?In the country where I'm living, we shouldn't afford more than a bit of food and some electronics per month or year. Since I have a chinese cellular, I can use that battery for other devices, but which?

Lately I've been wanting a social robot, and then I remembered about this Furby Boom I had on my room, unused for over a year. So I started to miss it.

Nobody has been making Li-Ion modifications for Furbies, but for other stuff instead, like a Game Boy Advance.

If it is possible for a Game Boy Advance, why not for a Furby?

Though I've been searching somewhere that modifying a Wii to work with Li-Ion batteries could cause it to burn, even though with AA batteries, it corrodes.

And I've just found out about a 90's Furby being modded to be used as an Amazon Alexa, though, I prefer getting an assistant that doesn't spy on you.

Did anybody modify their Furby to use other power source that isn't AA batteries? I really don't want my Furby having battery garbage on him. Please help me...

EDIT: Who archived this?"

"Jibo Family Update from the CEOJibo Family,

It’s an exciting time here at Jibo! Over the past month we’ve made some great progress, learned a lot, and we’re continuing to push toward the first Jibos beginning to ship, starting with our earliest pre-buyers, in November. Let’s get to it! 

### Delivery update ###

As our earliest supporters from our crowdsource campaigns, many of you have asked for a direct role in shaping Jibo. Here is your opportunity!  We are excited to get pre-public launch Jibos into your homes, because as a first-of-its-kind social robot, feedback from larger scale pre-launch rollouts is key to getting Jibo ready for his public launch. 

You have 2 options to choose from:  Participate in the pre-launch program, or receive your Jibo when he’s launched to the public after we’ve completed the program and incorporated that feedback into the public release version of Jibo.  

Here’s some additional information to help you choose whether participating in this program is right for you:

**Option A**

I understand ""pre-launch,"" and my household is up for it. Count me in.

* We will ship your Jibo starting in November on a first-ordered, first-received basis, rolling week-to-week from then.
* This is a pre-public launch Jibo!  It’s important you understand what that means.  Please see additional information below.
* You will receive surveys and communications from us where we will request your feedback- which will help us to improve.
* We will test some features/functions with you and we will provide over-the-air (OTA) updates to add functionality to your Jibo over time.
* At public launch, we will update your Jibo to his public launch software version via Wi-Fi update. This means your Jibo’s software and functionality will be up-to-date with all other Jibos when we begin the public shipments. 

**Option B**

I'll wait for the public version, thanks!

* If you do not typically participate in pre-launch programs, as ‘early adopters’ or beta testers, etc., and do not want to participate in the pre-launch early feedback program, this option is for you!
* Your Jibos will ship when Jibo is launched to the public. That date is dependent on the pre-launch beta period feedback, and we will keep you updated. 

**For those who chose Option A, some important additional information:**

* Your Jibo’s hardware is final...these are your Jibos to keep.  We will continue to update his software regularly, and this is where your continued usage and feedback will play an important role in our journey to finalize Jibo for his public launch.
* You will receive updates to your Jibo in your home over-the-air via WIFI, much like your mobile phone. Any updates, including the big Jibo v1.0 public launch version update, will be available to you automatically and free of charge.
* What does ‘pre-launch’ mean for the Jibo experience?  
 * It means that the experience itself won't be final. We will still work on reducing latency (the lag time between you speaking something and Jibo taking action), voice recognition accuracy, Jibo's vocal expressiveness, snappier performance, and WiFi router coverage.
 * Many of you may encounter issues...and we want and need to hear about those issues.  We want to hear what you like about Jibo, as well as all the ways that we might improve him.  Our surveys will guide the responses from you that will help us the most, and will give you the opportunity to provide new ideas we hadn’t anticipated.
* Our expectations are high for your active participation as a pre-public participant!
* You may be thinking, “I love the early access...but what about things like Jibo’s warranty, and/or return policy?”
 * The standard Jibo warranty is for one year, but if you select the pre-launch program, your warranty will extend from the beginning of the pre-launch program to 1-year after Jibo’s public launch.
 * The standard Jibo money-back guarantee is 30 days, but if you select the pre-launch program your guarantee will extend from the beginning of the pre-launch program to 30-days after Jibo’s public launch. 

### Other Jibo Program Updates ###

**Beta 1 update**

As you know, this first test involved sending Jibos into 24 homes for three day periods. The goal of this Beta was to test connectivity, home Wi-Fi systems, the setup process, and to understand important usage patterns. As is the case with any test like this, there were many learnings - some more significant than others. For example,  we were able to identify and fix an issue with a very specific router with which Jibo had trouble communicating, and we were able to see how family members of varying ages handled the Jibo setup process. 

**Beta 2 update**

I have mentioned previously that we will be completing a second in-home beta test, and I’m happy to share a few additional details with you all. Beta 2 is scheduled to begin on October 10th, and this time we will be putting **fully functioning pre-launch** Jibos into the homes of 25 families. During our previous test, the Jibos were missing some core functionality, because we were focused on out-of-the-box experience, setup, and wifi connectivity testing. For Beta 2, Jibo will live with his families for a longer period, this time one week, and the family will be expected to live with Jibo as normal - asking him to perform different tasks and interacting with him whenever possible. 

**Manufacturing update**

We have started manufacturing the pre-launch units in our plant in China. As we mentioned before, in order to produce the number of units we need for our early adopter community, we have to start producing and shipping Jibos to the US while we simultaneously continue to refine his software and experience. This means that Jibo will be fully updated with the latest and greatest the minute he’s turned on for the first time and connected to Wi-Fi. Below you will find some great photos from the factory, where you will see the first Jibos coming off the line and getting packaged up for delivery to our warehouse, and then to our Indiegogo supporters.

*Please note that the original email for backers contained links to choose which  Option (A or B) you would like to be a part of.  They have been left out in the text version above.*"
"New ship date for Early Access AnnouncedHello Jibo Family,

When we launched Jibo’s 2014 Indiegogo campaign, we set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Today, we are thrilled to bring to you the Jibo Early Access Program – our plan to provide you (as one of the first 2,500 Indiegogo supporters who opted to receive a pre-launch robot) your special bot. Beginning September 18, we will ship these early access units on a first-ordered, first-received basis, scheduled to be completed by the week of October 30.

We’re confident that you and your family and friends will bond with Jibo right out of the box. Once the initial set-up is complete, you can interact with Jibo in various ways. For example, you can ask him to snap a picture, the next week’s weather forecast, the location of the nearest coffee shop, who won yesterday’s baseball game or who was the U.S. president in 1850. Because he’s proactive, playful and spontaneous by nature, he’ll greet you by name and may even share a joke. He’s also a terrific dancer and loves when you pat his head. Powered by emerging facial and voice recognition technology, he can recognize up to 16 people in your family. With every interaction he has, he’s learning and sharpening his skills.

During this early access period, Jibo will still be in a developmental stage. This means that while you’ll have first access to a powerful, maturing robot whose potential is virtually limitless, we’ll continue to optimize and improve Jibo. Jibo’s platform will support many future capabilities and improvements, all of which will be introduced automatically over-the-air by Jibo, Inc. We look forward to providing new, exciting announcements about his evolving features in the coming months.

Thank you in advance for volunteering to be a part of this important program. We will rely on your feedback regarding all aspects of Jibo's current performance, and this will help us to fine-tune him for public release.



From all of us at Jibo, Inc., we hope you’re as excited as we are to bring Jibo into your home. Thank you for your continued support as we create a truly revolutionary social robot!

 

Steve Chambers, CEO"

"In what ways can robots be useful in aged care?I'm a electronics hobbyist and I'm wondering how elderly people in aged care can benefit from technology. Some of the value of social robots like NAO, AIBO, Pepper, etc. (as opposed to heavy-duty physical labour robots) that I can imagine:
- Monitoring well-being using camera and biometric data from wearables for health coaching (reminders to take medication or exercise) or even surveillance (when human care workers are overworked or stressed)
- Read out news, stories, or play music 
- Play quiz games?
 
&nbsp;
  
I have been volunteering at an aged care centre for a while now, and I am quite aware of the importance of human presence to the elderly. However, I do wonder if there's more that can be done in the time they spent on their own (which can be quite often.)
 
&nbsp;
  
Any thoughts on this?
 
&nbsp;
  
*Edit:*
To give a more concrete idea of what I have in mind, I'm thinking of using raspberry pi for the main brain (audio, image processing, internet feeds) and Arduino for peripherals (LEDs, LCD indicator, Passive infra red, servo motors). Possibly housing all of electronics in a woolen sock. :P
 
&nbsp;
  
I was inspired by MyDeskFriend (by Arimaz) years ago. Too bad it never took off. I liked the idea, and I think it could be used in a different way. 
 
&nbsp;
  
*Summary of the possibly useful ideas - from this post, and also from PMs*  
- Communication  
  -- Skype, Facebook messenger, Whatsapp   
  -- Help start a conversation when visitors come over (suggest a conversation topic)  
- Monitoring  
  -- Skin temperature  -- Possibly a thermistor positioned on the back of the seat, connected to an esp8266 / zigbee, sending packets of data to the robot.  
  -- Incontinence  -- Measure change in conductivity (http://www.conductivethread.ca) or use thermistors. 
  -- Absconder  -- notify care givers   
- Cognitive  
  -- Help remember phone numbers  
  -- Reminders (food, medication, exercise)  
- Stimulation  
  -- Play songs  
  -- Read news headlines  
  -- Read tweets  
  -- Tell jokes (which can encourage them to re-tell to others)  
  -- Games  
- Interactivity  
  -- Simple greetings / prompting user to see if user wants something  
  -- Voice recognition (Receive commands to do things)

"Online Courses for Robotics Software Engineer or Machine Learning Researcher/Data Scientist PositionsLittle bit about myself:
I have a bachelor's in electrical and electronics engineering with a specialization in control systems. I will graduate master's in August 2021 (hopefully) which is at systems design engineering and I worked on social robotics and human-robot interaction. Academic wise everything is good (high GPA, nice school, University of Waterloo). 

I want to try out the industry. I am interested in the titles robotics software engineer, machine learning researcher/ data scientist. However, I exactly do not know which online courses should I take while I am getting prepared for interviews. 

The main problem is I have never taken a CS course before, so I don't know too much about CS concepts. To compensate this, I took Harvard's CS50: Intro to CS. It was not super difficult to finish, but I learned a lot about some of the basic stuff laying underhood. 

I need advice about the next step I should proceed. I have some experience with Robot Operating System (ROS) and I am planning to take an online course to increase it more. 

For ML, I already know concepts behind. I know the math and theory in general. I need on point practical courses which will teach me the tools/libraries that companies are looking for. I would appreciate if someone experienced can guide me a bit. There are so many different information out there. I don't know which one to select. 

I really appreciate your help! :)"

### This essay seeks to define the negative effects of anxiety on dating. The positive effects of confidence on dating, and strategies the reader can use, to reduce anxiety while simultaneously boosting confidence and dating skills, with the goal of having a healthy love life.

### anxiety

### n. an emotion characterized by apprehension and somatic symptoms of tension in which an individual anticipates impending danger, catastrophe, or misfortune. The body often mobilizes itself to meet the perceived threat: Muscles become tense, breathing is faster, and the heart beats more rapidly. Anxiety may be distinguished from fear both conceptually and physiologically, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Anxiety is considered a future-oriented, long-acting response broadly focused on a diffuse threat, whereas fear is an appropriate, present-oriented, and short-lived response to a clearly identifiable and specific threat. —anxious adj.

### social anxiety

### fear of social situations in which embarrassment may occur (e.g., making conversation, meeting strangers, dating) or there is a risk of being negatively evaluated by others (e.g., seen as stupid, weak, or anxious). Social anxiety involves apprehensiveness about one’s social status, role, and behavior. When the anxiety causes an individual significant distress or impairment in functioning, a diagnosis of social phobia may be warranted.

### depression

### n.

### 1. a negative affective state, ranging from unhappiness and discontent to an extreme feeling of sadness, pessimism, and despondency, that interferes with daily life. Various physical, cognitive, and social changes also tend to co-occur, including altered eating or sleeping habits, lack of energy or motivation, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and withdrawal from social activities. It is symptomatic of a number of mental health disorders.

### -American Psychological Association Dictionary

### Problem:

### Anxiety, social anxiety, and depression are all unhealthy expressions of what happens to humans when they are disconnected socially, mentally, or physically from other humans. As such they lead to unhealthy behaviors that serve as a warning or barrier to starting healthy relationships with others including potential romantic partners.

### Solution A:

### Beyond the obvious, slow-acting, and hit or miss solutions of, getting to a higher social standing in life, making more money, and working out more, Solution A is ‘Pick Up’ or ‘Game’.

### This is the study of human dating relationships, opening, rapport, and sexual interaction. Like any science, moral judgments are not applied, the focus is simply on what works. I.e what gets you laid while not infringing on the legal rights of others.

### And make no mistake it works.

### However, though it serves to make the individual more efficient at dealing with their approach-anxiety, and provides a framework within which to approach and begin relationships more easily, It actually does little to reduce the actual anxiety the individual is feeling.

>**This is why Mystery can be the top pickup artist in the world and still be suicidal when rejected by a girl-friend.**  
**-The Game, Neil Strauss**  


### Moral: You can know everything about pick-up and still not know enough to maintain a satisfying, healthy, and happy relationship with a woman.

### Solution B:

### Psychological And Emotional Maturity Through Therapy;

### This includes study, therapy, support groups, joining social groups, better sleep, diet and exercise, journaling, meditation, etc.

### The list is by no means exhaustive, but shows just a few of the strategies available to you, to become more well-rounded and healthier.  I highly recommend “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari, as well as “The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind” by Joseph Murphy for a deeper dive into how Anxiety and Depression work and the proper use of your own mind.

### Solution B will lead to a happier and healthier life which will eventually trickle down to your love life, but for a more direct, hands-on and more efficient route, I present.

### Solution C:

### Simultaneously  studying “Game” to increase your proficiency with starting romantic relationships with women of quality,

### AND

### Reducing anxiety and increasing confidence and self-esteem, by taking part in therapies that are proven to increase mental, physical, and emotional health.

### Solution A can be seen as ‘offense’ or outer-game, it makes it so you know what the possibilities are in any social situation especially dating.

### While solution B, can be seen as ‘defense’ or your inner-game, it makes it so you know what the healthy, decent choice is, in any social situation especially dating, and gives you the inner strength and resilience to be at peace with your decision.

### I believe solution C is currently, the most efficient dating strategy available to humans.

### *Everything I write and teach, I have tried and tested. The last few years have been a blur of shallow, though fun relationships, whether gaming with bros, or getting with girls.

### It was great, but over COVID, I had a “Come to Jesus” moment where I realized I was having lots of shallow fun but was not actually improving as a person, I had plateaued. I could start a romantic relationship with anyone but few lasted after the initial consummation and almost none of the women I “dated” are currently in my life. What a waste. This is why I sought out how to actually improve myself and my health as opposed to just getting better and better with women. And now I am here to pass on that knowledge.

### In conclusion, work on dealing with your inner-game (mental health) while working on your outer-game (tactics and strategies), to become a healthier, happier person with ""game"". Don’t become a social robot, whose every waking thought is “game” and don’t become addicted to sex or love.

### And if you seek a frame-work or teacher to help guide you on this wonderful journey, contact me, I can work with you remotely.

### All the best, brothers.

"Post graduation in Aerospace EngineeringHello everyone! Looking for some help and suggestions.

I have an admit for the MEng Aerospace program in one of the top universities in Canada.If I join, it’ll be as an international student who’s done his undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering. 

My interest lies in field of robotics (Social Robotics, Unmanned and autonomous systems, etc). I’ve done internships involving hand-held robotics and IoT. Also, I have experience in the field of programming (Python- OOPs, Data structures, etc).

Now I could probably shift to the Mechanical program too but the Aero program has a compulsory industrial internship as part of the program which I believe will be very helpful in terms of landing jobs later. 

Personally, I have no preference in terms of the core subjects of mechanical or aerospace since they’re related very closely. 

I’d like to know what you suggest and why? I wish to pursue a career in my field of interest as mentioned above. I would highly appreciate your insight. 

Thank you!"

"Big Mistake: Day 169 (IMPORTANT)I lost my streak on day 169. I know those of you who have yet to pass the 90 day mark might not understand how it is possible but I will tell you exactly what built up to this moment and so you can refocus your efforts if needed, and mostly so I can come clean with myself.

1. Improper Motivation: I had begun the journey expecting never to watch porn or jerk off again, and to  instead save it for a girl. While granted, I was able to get into talks with a girl within a month and now be able to call her my girlfriend. Calm down, this new sense of confidence is mostly a placebo, but an important one that should be angeled differently. 

2. Don’t let the source of your confidence rely on the binary outcome of relapsing. “Feel guilty, it’s healthy that you regret previous actions. But don’t feel shame, as you aren’t that same person, you learned from your mistakes and are a changed man”- Terry Crews. 

3. Back to the girlfriend. It’s amazing to have her and I told her my whole NoFap story but she doesn’t know of any of the details, including this one of course. Which is fine, but as you can see, it’s due in part to the fact that I feel guilty. If COVID hadn’t come around, I guarantee you I would be out there trying to get some. Now I obviously wouldn’t be trying to force myself upon her in any way, but lingering in the back of my mind is the #1 motivating factor who has been cheering me on all along— and he’s telling me that the clock is ticking on rent. I’m not gonna lie, I probably would’ve “got some” if I had the past couple of months in the outdoors with her having an intimate physical relationship. But would that fix things? I would just crave more and my driving factor would be to have more sex, even if it does revolve around a girl attracted to me. And Joe Rogan made a decent point on how some of these successful fapstronauts made it out, but that they may be subject to relationships with people solely for the reason to have sex. Maybe that’s a good problem to have, maybe that not what the nofap movement stands for. But I assure you that some people who start with the wrong mindset and end up finding out that they are fuckable enough might find that pitfall too late in their journey. Nevertheless, that reality never came to fruition obviously, and I don’t live in a softly hit area by COVID so people take it seriously. I instead realized I was becoming increasingly interested in having sex with nothing to work with. I was cracking and I can see it in retrospect. I remember having delusional fantasies over what my first time would be like and how I would go absolutely above and beyond in the bedroom in all sorts of pornographically driven manners. It was all fake, and once I was living in that make believe work, my internal compass decided that pseudo-porn wasn’t so bad after all (talked about next). And thenI broke obviously, but not how most would think it would happen.

3. It started with innocent searches that lead me to a link that either offered somewhat lewd content or straight up finding out someone I know or consume alternate content from also makes porn. That 50/50 fight I had with myself, debating whether I should look because I was “curious” but not jerking off was justified. It truly was a 50/50. Sometimes I would cave in and sometimes I wouldn’t. I remember when I first saw it after like 3 months, and the absolute rush I felt (mostly in part due to the “rebellious” adrenaline). That’s when I knew just the act of viewing was supporting my previous addiction and was as bad as jerking off. But that slow release of my boundaries led to the ultimatum that was: Day 169. 

4. I have learned all of the above and now realize the roots that I must not stray from, all of which ground me to the idea of not rewarding myself to a chemical blast to my receptors for literally nothing. 

5. FINALLY: Most important factor. Being aware. Mindfulness. I won’t lie to you, there were many other little things and misconceptions and fantasies and mistakes that lead to my ultimate downfall. And I will also tell you, I am no stranger to mindfulness. I will establish my credibility by saying this, I have been practicing some form of mindfulness, throughout my entire life through my native religion Buddhism. Of course my mindfulness wasn’t fully fledged, and many other “followers” didn’t practice it enough or at all. My point is is that some of you claim to have mindfulness, and of course you are the only one who can really decide that, but be aware (lol) that you have leagues to progress before becoming truly mindful, and that’s the sort of mindfulness that people claim to be the killer of chemical desire. And yes it’s cultivated through trial and error, not just time and practice, just like any other skill. Funny note, mindfulness shouldn’t make you a social robot, nor should nofap make you an instant pimp. I will go back to my Buddhist roots and advise you that “the middle path” is the way to go, especially when it comes to your general mindset. 

5. Haha 169 lol. Yea I stopped counting for the most part after reaching 90 days, but I remember the start date. I counted it back after failing, and it was 169 and I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. 

6. Bonus Story 1: I fought the beast for control on day 170 after feeling like I learned my lesson on day 169 and being happy that I can start over correctly. Yea guess what, it’s still a shitty chemical drug and it doesn’t give a fuck about a change in a sudden change of heart. I came (lol) very close to failing, but luck was on my side and I snapped out of it. Back into control like Majin Vegeta— I wouldn’t allow my pride to be tainted by fools gold, especially a second time.

7. Bonus Story 2: And today, day 171, I had to get over yet another misconception/fucked up idea in my head. It’s hard to realize mistakes (especially small ones you gloss over) and it’s even harder to implement change. I probably will learn something new and get close to making an old mistake twice tomorrow, that’s just how life is. Whenever you feel trapped in your head that’s considering relapsing talk to yourself audibly or in your mental, knock on that locked door and yell and shout until that brain that has been washed with dopamine that is being driven by an addict stops driving and turns an ear to person outside who just wants a ticket to come aboard and get back in control of their own mind. Thank you, and don’t be afraid to laugh at your own struggles, it helps put things into perspective and can put you in a better mood after escaping a dark place or even failing, you can get back up. Life goes on, don’t leave yourself behind."

# UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF ORPHANED JIBO ROBOTS PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES

[**17 Comments**](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/08/uncertain-future-of-orphaned-jibo-robots-presents-opportunities/#comments)

* **by:**

[**Roger Cheng**](https://hackaday.com/author/inkarc/)[**March 8, 2019**](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/08/)

📷

In our modern connected age, our devices have become far more powerful and useful when they could draw upon resources of a global data network. The downside of a cloud-connected device is the risk of being over-reliant on computers outside of our own control. The people who brought a Jibo into their home got a stark reminder of this fact when some (but not all) Jibo robots [gave their owners a farewell message](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/04/social-robot-jibo-shutting-down-message/) as their servers are shut down, leaving behind little more than a piece of desktop sculpture.

Jibo launched their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign with the tagline “[The World’s First Social Robot For The Home](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jibo-the-world-s-first-social-robot-for-the-home#/).” Full of promises of how Jibo will be an intelligent addition to a high tech household, it has always struggled to justify its price tag. It cost as much as a high end robot vacuum, but without the house cleaning utility. Many demonstrations of a Jibo’s capabilities centered around its voice control, which an Amazon Echo or Google Home could match at a fraction of the price.

By the end of 2018, [all assets and intellectual property have been sold](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/jibo-is-probably-totally-dead-now) to SQN Venture Partners. They [have said little](https://www.sqnvp.com/portfolion_n/jibo/) about what they planned to do with their acquisition. Some Jibo owner still hold hope that there’s still a bright future ahead. Both on the [official forums](https://discuss.jibo.com/t/farewell-jibo-lets-keep-moving-forward/3272) (for however long that will stay running) and on [unofficial channels like Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jibo/comments/axizta/jibo_is_saved/). Other owners have given up and unplugged their participation in this social home robotics experiment.

If you see one of these orphans in [your local thrift store](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/13/the-life-changing-magic-of-buying-stuff-to-hack/) for a few bucks, consider adopting it. You could join the group hoping for something interesting down the line, but you’re probably more interested in its hacking potential: there is a [Nvidia Jetson inside](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/10/nvidia-brings-computer-vision-and-deep-learning-to-the-embedded-world/) good for running neural networks. Probably a Tegra K1 variant, because [Jibo used the Jetson TK1 to develop the robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9rrVFd5zGM) before launch. Jibo has always promised a [developer SDK](https://www.jibo.com/developers/) for the rest of us to extend Jibo’s capabilities, but it never really materialized. The inactive [Github repo](https://github.com/jiborobot) mainly consists of code talking to servers that are now offline, not much dealing directly with the hardware.

Jibo claimed thousands were sold and, if they start becoming widely available inexpensively, we look forward to a community working to give new purpose to these poor abandoned robots. If you know of anyone who has done a teardown to see exactly what’s inside, or if someone has [examined upgrade files](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/02/live-hacking-and-a-midi-keytar/) to create custom Jibo firmware, feel free to put a link in the comments and help keep these robots out of [e-waste](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/20/the-woeful-world-of-worldwide-e-waste/).

If you want to experiment with power efficient neural network accelerators but rather work with an officially supported development platform, we’ve looked at the Jetson TK1 successors [TX1](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/24/the-nvidia-jetson-tx1-its-not-for-everybody-but-it-is-very-cool/) and [TX2](https://hackaday.com/2017/03/14/hands-on-nvidia-jetson-tx2-fast-processing-for-embedded-devices/). And more recently, Google has [launched one of their own](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/05/google-launches-ai-platform-that-looks-remarkably-like-a-raspberry-pi/), as has our [friends at Beaglebone](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/06/this-beaglebones-got-ai/)."

Hi, my name is Jack and this story I'm about to tell you doesn't end well. I just thought I'd let you know in advance, so you know, don't get your hopes up. 

My story starts back in my freshman year of high school. I'm a major introvert, not because I'm scared or intimidated by other people, but simply because I don't enjoy the company of others. It's been this way for as long as I can remember. My mother was never really around due to work and my father...Well, let's just pretend he never existed in the first place. 

Ever since I was young I've always been given opportunities that others could only dream of, why you ask. Well, I'm considered incredibly attractive and when I say 'incredibly attractive', I mean like that tall, dark and handsome hero straight out of a novel, that all women fantasize about and all men envy. I've received many modeling offers and even other job offers, because of my looks alone. People want to be around me, even if just to be seen with someone as good-looking as me. Despite my good looks, I've never really cared about my appearence. Do I enjoy the fact that I can go up to any random person and ask them for a favor knowing they'll ablige? Sure. Is it cool being invited to all the parties that the cool kids attend? I guess so. However, you should never judge a book by its cover, and I'm a prime example of that. 


You see, I have a secret, a very dark secret. I've always been fascinated by death, the feeling of being on the edge, the rush of fading into the unknown... So as you've probably guessed by now, I like killing people. Now you may ask, well there must be some reason for this, was I abused as child or maybe bullied. The answer is no, I may never have known my father and my mother always being at work never helped strengthen our relationship but I've always had it easy. Some might even say...too easy. That all changed once I got to high school. My stress free life that is. 

I had been killing people for a year prior to entering high school, when I suddenly just stopped. I guess you could say, I got a little bored. Living in a small town with a bunch of nobodies, that no one gives a damn about, isn't really the most exciting destination for a serial killer. I mainly killed people that were passing through our lonely town. Sometimes men, sometimes women. Though I could never really bring myself to hurt children, there's just something pure about them, you know. They know nothing of the world, they're untouched. I've always envied that about children. Anyways, back to my story. It's the first day of high school, a dreadfully sunny day. After going through all the ceremonial crap, we get sorted into our classes. I'm in 1b. Just like middle school, my class seems to be made up of the same types of people. There's a couple of wannabe jocks, some nerds here and there, a few preppy kids, that one grunge kid that always looks depressed, the average kids that are neither popular nor uncool and the girls that won't stop talking about me. 

I really do hate those superficial types of girls. Always telling me how amazing I am, eventhough they know nothing about me. In there eyes I can do no wrong, simply because I'm attractive. They're the type of people that make me want to commit mass homicide. But then something wonderful happened, or at least so I thought at the time. Just before class was about to start this girl walked in. She had shoulder-length brown hair and very normal brown eyes. She looked exactly like your average girl, there was nothing special about her appearence to be honest. And yet for some reason when she looked at me and smiled, my heart skipped a beat. It was like jumping in the cool ocean on a scorching hot summer's day. 

As soon as lunch came all the girls in my class gathered together like a bunch of frantic ants. What were they talking about? Yes, once again you've guessed it. Me. They were talking about me, about how handsome I was, texting all their girlfriends about how lucky they were to be put in the same class as me. On the other side of things , the boys also gathered in their groups to voice their disdain towards me, amongst themselves, as usual. It's a rather pathetic scene if you think about it. A bunch of insecure, socialized robots flock to each others company, one half admiring my beauty, the other half wishing I never existed. It makes me feel like a piece of art, encompassed by critics. 

However, there is one, one person who isn't talking about me. It's the girl with normal brown eyes. The one who doesn't strike as having any uniqueness to her. She kind of looks like one of them to be honest. And yet something about her feels so different that it's almost intimidating. She just stares out the window, not paying any attention to anyone else. I wonder what she's thinking about, if she's even thinking at all. She seems so....free."

"How to handle a post by a suspected imposter?Hi guys...I am a mod of /r/Jibo and have been for about two years now.  We are a small tight-knit community of fans of a home social robot called Jibo with only 139 members currently.

About two weeks ago, a new user popped in claiming to be an ex-employee from the company and posted [""My story with Jibo""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jibo/comments/4y7asn/my_story_with_jibo/).  It was a rant about how the company had treated him or her badly during their supposed time there and showcased several details about the company, shining a pretty negative light on it overall.  The user had offered little to corroborate their story, but since it allowed an interesting discussion to open up on our small subreddit, I decided at that time to let it stay.  I had no way of knowing whether it was true or not, so until that evidence came up, the post remained.

Very recently I was contacted by the company themselves saying that they reviewed the story, interviewed their ex-employees (a very small group since they are a tiny start-up) and were sure that this post was false.  Again, I had only their word against this person on the subject.

So now I'm stuck in the middle of the two sides, and now that I think deeply on the subject, I am fairly certain that it was posted by an existing member of our subreddit using a new ""anonymous"" account.  

My question is: can you guys at Reddit check to see if the user account who posted that (JiboDev0915) matches the IP address of any other listed as members of the subreddit.  I do not want to know any personally identifiable info...I just want to know if this post had malicious intent or not, and if so, be able to correct it and bring a little peace back to our community.  I also have a few ideas of users that might have been the ""anonymous"" poster if that would help narrow it down."
"3’s (or anyone), how do you cope with other people’s opinions and being genuine?I think it’s becoming a gnawing problem in my life that I overvalue other people’s opinions to the point where it feels like I don’t have morals myself, rather it’s determined by what would be the most socially acceptable. I’ve been growing my own morals, but I still feel controlled by other people’s standards and approval because I don’t feel like there’s much to me in terms of real affection since I’ve never grown up with them, so I’m kinda starting from scratch. My love thirst not to the point where I’m a social robot, but more like if I analyze lots of stuff that I do, it’s usually in service to an image of me that’s optimal, one that’s socially praised, popular, or just said to be a person you can care about and call a good guy. On the other hand, if I do disagree with society or anyone else’s opinions (given I don’t dislike them outright, which is most people), it feels like a personal confrontation to my values by a stronger force (other people and society, which I tend to lump together) and it makes me feel uneasy.

Examples:

Someone said they didn’t believe in true love, which hurt my feelings and image of idealized happiness. Really, if anyone bursts my confidence bubble that I use for achievement fuel, it hurts my feelings quite a bit.

I felt sick to my stomach when I looked at a list of signs of clinical narcissism and found I agreed with portions of it mainly because of the next example

I felt anxiety when I read articles saying narcissists don’t understand love and affection despite everything they do, mainly because I don’t know if example two was correct about whether I had the illness or not and if this example was right that I didn’t understand love

I immediately leaned on society by asking the incredibly mechanical question of what love was because I didn’t really know what its parameters were beside a state of being with certain characteristics including affection, self-sacrifice and understanding

———————————

So that’s my dilemma. I did just go on a long tangent about love and it would help to understand from other threes (or anyone) how they become genuine so they avoid this existential crisis, because I would like to have some peace of mind knowing that what I do is real and not seemingly a subliminally calculated maneuver to make people like me more. Am I doing the right thing? (I know there’s irony in that question, a lot of it, but society is how I see my way morally right now, like echolocation. But if I just knew if I was doing it right, I think I could have enough confidence to navigate on my own) Thanks, guys."

"My ADHD struggleBellow is an email I'll never send to my tutor, manager or course provider. I've tried before and people just pass it off as an excuse or a complaint. And if people arround me just understood I wouldnt have to feel guilty for being myself. People are different and think differently, and no one should have to treat me differently without an understanding of why and only treat me differently out of submissive frustration. 



May I firstly say that all of the staff and apprentices I have met have been friendly and good at what they do. Some of things I may say in this email may be specific to the way I think and the way I act, I have some form of ASD and ADHD so one would assume my thought process and the way I interoperate things would differ from the average apprentice.

 

I have found myself re doing a lot of coursework and making substantial changes to it. This is fine, I am plenty able to re do something that is not correct, I fully understand that complaining about something won’t fix it, as much as it may make us feel better. However for me, instructions and Briefs for work I am about to start, absolutely has to be specific, as much as the work has to be detailed and clear, so do instructions for me. I find interoperating things that may seem clear and understandable to another, feel like guessing to me, and when I am about to sink several hours of my time into some work on a guess, that what I am about to write is what you as the person who set it is looking for. It’s hard to get the motivation to do the work, and harder not to find myself not putting the proper thought into it that it deserves even when I know and understand that the work is important and necessary for me to achieve the outcome I want. This may seem counter intuitive and almost as if it’s my choice weather or not to put as much effort into a piece of work as I should, and because of this almost guess work that an assignment comes with for me it results in stress, poor work and a lack of motivation and momentum that’s hard to get back.

 

The previous paragraph sums up almost all of the school and college work I have ever done, and it really has been difficult for me to achieve in this way. In a job or task where the requirements are clear to me, or a creative task that truly lets me show what I can do, with the assessment on that being an underlying skill not a series of requirements, I excel in compared to my usual work and often others around me, as that’s how my brain is wired to work. When met with criteria that is open to subject, and can be interoperated many different ways it’s harder for me to know what I should do. An example of this, be it a bad one, would be if you were asked to pick a knot to tie two pieces of rope together, and asked why you chose it and to then tie the rope to show you have the skills down. This is actually very similar to some of the questions we are given and assignments set for my apprenticeship. Obviously in how they are assessed and not the subject of the task. With this analogy you are open to interpretation, there are many ways to tie rope. Someone may say that a reef knot is best as it is simple and strong, uses little of the rope and tightens as it is pulled on. 

If this was the answer given, that answer is not wrong however for me to answer the question I would need far more context and a clear situation, the thickness of the rope, are the two pieces the same thickness?, is it for hemp or fibre rope or is it nylon, is it one of each, as they have different levels of friction, and flexibility. Is it to support a heavy weight or a light one, will the knot need to be undone or stay permanent, will it carry something of value, if so a not with some kind of back up, or redundancy. If the knot is exposed to rain that may affect my selection. 

 

At this point I think you understand, the person who said reef knot in answer to the question could be right. I could go into far too much detail explaining the different sorts of knots and their uses and not given the answer they were looking for, as the examiner may have been just trying to find out if you can give an answer and justify it.

 

I may have answered with the reef knot and explained my reasoning, and missed the mark, as that knot may be unfit for use with differently sized rope, and the correct answer could have been a fisherman’s knot that works in both scenarios.

 

As bad of an example/analogy that was, I hope it explains my struggle with the kind of work we are set, today I met with Huw and we went over some of my work, I wrote it against the Project Template and though my work wasn’t what Huw was looking for, it does lie within the lines of that template he provided me with. Reading through the template you will find that it asks for you to ‘explain’ and asks ‘how you did it’ to ‘introduce’ new topics and things you have worked on, which to me means writing. The way I went about doing this task is well within the interpretable expectation of this document. Then again so is what Huw is looking for out of my work, which is why I find myself in the awkward and frustrating cycle of re-doing work each time with a little bit of a better idea of what it should be for the marks, but there could be 100 ways of answering a question, and though all right the examiner may have decided that they are only looking for 1 of those ways. 

 

If anything this email is to help understand why I find some things difficult, I’m not saying I don’t get lazy with things from time to time, but more often than not I’m just frozen like a computer program that has not had its parameters defined enough for it to achieve the results you seek from it, it being me. 

 

I never have and never will seek to use any kind of label, diagnosis or anything else as an excuse for anything, doing so would be a disgrace to the years I spent in waiting rooms, classrooms and exam halls alike, tapping on the desk and shaking my legs trying to decide what the person evaluating me against a list of criteria is looking for. I have found with my friends and family they repeat themselves for me all too often, each time with increasing detail until I get the information I need to understand the given situation, task, or question. This is the same with everyone I engage with, and to reduce this prolonged time for the results you were after, the first time I am asked something or issued a task to do, open to any kind of interpretation, explain it with the extra detail it needed for me to be able to hit the ground running. This kind extra clarification is small and often takes almost no extra time to convey, but doing it the first time round saves time and frustration when it happens. 

 

I’m not some social robot gone wrong though, conversation I am okay with and misinterpretation always comes out but when it comes to work that is both important for me to meet my goals, and on limited time, such as exams, it’s better that any misinterpretation is accounted for and accommodated for. Surely it’s the reason for having the labels in the first place.

 

Really the ways to sort this out are simple and easy, when it comes to exams example papers, both good okay and bad are amazing, I had this for my English re test and did nearly twice as well on the exam. You get taught about the pass merit and distinction, but being able to see a document of this kind that you know have passed, is great as you can see how its structured, the ratio of evidence to written language, as well as how much detail to go into, these are things that could take months to explain and are open to so much interpretation the only way to get this across effectively is to just give some examples. I understand that showing you another students work is a bit of an iffy grey area, however having a tutor create some pieces of work that are designed to be of different levels, shows both a great understanding of the topic, and reinforces the legitimacy of the rest of the words the tutor can give on the subject. This is something my English teacher tried for the re-test group and it worked very well for everyone.

 

Also mentioning what the examiner or criteria is looking for specifically in the supporting documents such as the Project Template would be brilliant in the future. I know you can’t just tell me the answers and call it a day, I like a challenge anyway, but allowing me to worry about the quality of the work, my choice of words and everything else that comes with submitting some work, would be better than me miss-interoperating the work set, and approaching the work in the wrong way all together. 

 

To show my understanding, a test is a test, if you don’t get the question you don’t get the mark, that’s how it has been, will be and always will be, that’s the point and I support that. When it comes to the coursework though the tutors are kindly patient enough and supportive enough to shape my work to what it needs to be over a series of months with advice, suggestions, and corrections, however this could be done in the first attempt with some minor changes at most, if I could get all of the information that is given me by the tutor on the piece of work over the corse of me completing it the first time round, id have had the same result if not better as my motivation wouldn’t have been sapped away by the re-submit button as I work through the set task.

 

I’ve found my education this way for the past 18 years so if my dart just hit the wall and not the board then I’ve got yet another blunt dart and a still pristine dart board, I’m not after a bullseye just a fair shot without someone blind folding me, increasing the distance and flipping the board over while still expecting me to hit the board and not disappoint.

 

I just read through my email, and though a bit dramatic it does the job I can’t learn and work the same way as others it doesn’t work, ill get there eventually I’m pretty good at finding my own way to the destination, often a bit late and rough around the edges, but I get there, but It could be a lot easier for everyone if we have a bit more understanding for others.

 

Not saying that anyone has done anything wrong, if anything people are very tolerant of me and always been supportive, but that’s without knowing why they should have to be.

 

Regards,

"The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide to Never Run Out Of Things To Say Revealed | Talk ForeverIt's Saturday Night. You decide you don't wanna stay home, so you go out to that place you like downtown! You get there and you're a little anxious. Everyone is already dancing, talking, vibing, etc. For you, it's normal! You've already taught yourself to acknowledge your anxiety and proactively work to overcome it. So, you take some deep breathes, gather the courage, and decide to start your night by talking to that cool group right beside the bar. You get there, the group is friendly, you introduce yourself, and everything is going great.

Somehow, you no longer feel anxious and you're just enjoying yourself...*living in the moment.* You talk for a little bit, laugh, joke around, and then BOOM! Your mind goes blank, and you run out of things to say. ""*Shit""* \- you say to yourself - *""What do I do now""*. Due to what just happened, your heart rate increases, you start to stutter, and your anxiety is back. **What the hell do you do?** You've met this awesome group that you want to spend the rest of your night with, they've accepted you into their reality, and you ***HAVE*** to do something about what's happening to you....**BUT WHAT?!**

**Here's EXACTLY What I Do To NEVER Run Out Of Things To Say And Avoid Awkward Silences:**

*DISCLAIMER: What I am about to share has been tested hundreds of times. These methods were used by me personally and work.*

P.S: These methods should only be used in moments of anxiety. DO NOT rely on these methods as your primary conversation tools. Use these as back up ONLY. Our goal at Project Ecstasy isn't to turn you into a Social Robot, but rather a Natural, Charismatic Individual! Express your personality genuinely, and ONLY use these methods when you're out of juice.

**Enough talking, Let's Get Into It**

    1. Accept that Awkward Silences are Bound to Happen

Yes, that's right! The first step you want to do is accept that awkward silences happen.

""BUT WHY?""

Welp, when you are desperately trying to avoid every single awkward silence, your mind will keep looking for the ""perfect"" thing to say, you get shoved in your head, you're not present anymore, and SURRPISE! Shit gets awkward. When you let go of the NEED to have the perfect thing to say, and just accept that some of things you'll say may be weird.....You'll notice your conversation skills get better instantly.  Once your filter is out, you have a wider range of topics to explore and you're less likely to be awkward....**Paradoxical much? I KNOW!**

    2. Have Some Back Up Subjects/Topics in The Back of Your Mind

Another thing that has helped me A LOT when I was first starting out is having a backup. When you're first starting out, this is a life saver! Here's what to do:

    -Grab a Note Book
    -Grab a Pen
    -Write at least 3 subjects you are interested in (Make sure they can lead to full on discussions)
    -Avoid Questions that lead to a Yes/No answer.

***When you have some subjects in the back of your head, you can always go back to them in moments of anxiety or when you don't know what to say.***

Some cool subjects:

* **The Weather...No, I'm Kidding**

But seriously, ANYTHING works. Combined with the correct Vocal Tonality/Body Language/ Eye Contact/ Facial Expressions and all other sub communications, all topics can make the person/group you're talking to almost beg for your next word. So, if you feel like to can't keep the attention of people (or even have it in the first place), this is where you need to begin. *(I'll be covering those on another day + in depth on our YouTube Channel)*

Sub Communications are your super powers. Period.

I can list a 100 more ways you can keep a conversation going and never run out of things to say, but I won't. Why? Because you'll be overwhelmed, you won't know where to start, and you'll do nothing.

*So, to see the fastest results....DO ONE THING AT A TIME, MASTER IT, MOVE TO THE NEXT THING.*

"I'm writing a ""Guide to Getting Your Shit Together"" for my little brothers and some friends and need to know what should I add/remove?I've got three little brothers (one of which is about to go to college!) that are 8-12 years younger than me.  I've been away from home for almost a decade, for various reasons, and I really like to write some advice for them about how to be successful for people that didn't excel in school, don't have high profile jobs, and the like.  I want to write something that will really help them be successful pursuing their own unique interests -- but I don't want to tell them ""just do what I did"".  My end goal is probably a website I can point them too, but for now I just want to nail the ""Success Process.""

&nbsp;
  
So any feedback on the topic would be great.

    
&nbsp;

If I had to guess, I'd say there are 4 ""phases"" to success, just from everything I've read. 

&nbsp;

**First Phase:  It's All About You**

&nbsp;

1. Personal Responsibility: BYOB

&nbsp;

**Second Phase:  Setting the Stage**

&nbsp;

2. Big Wins:  Principles Are More Important Than Details
3. Process:  Process Is Repeatable, Product Is Unpredictable
4. Habits:  People Are Social Robots and So Are You
5. Goals:  Any Loser Can Set Goals

&nbsp;

**Third Phase:  Tightening Up**

&nbsp;

6. Consistency:  Just Shut up and Show Up
7. Preparation:  Front Loading the Work
8. Environment:  It's Yours to Terra Form

**Last Phase:  Making Your Success Real**

&nbsp;

9. Courage:  Create your own Success
10. Confidence:  Making the Leap

&nbsp;

If you had to give your little brothers advice on how to be successful -- without building up a bunch of college debt or working at a job they hate -- what would you tell them?"

Within the department of Computer Science, USC provides a Master of Science in Computer Science (Intelligent Robotics). The graduate-degree diploma exposes students to the design and building of robots, and to the pc techniques required for control and information processing.

Some of the careers somebody interested in robotics may explore embody robotics engineering, software growth, robotics technician, even gross sales engineers. The world at present is simply tapping into the potential for robotics and all of the ways the sophistication of models and laptop programming can improve the setting and world. Today’s robots are working towards speech recognition, artificial emotions, character, gestures, and social intelligence. Much of the analysis performed now focuses more on what kind of new robots professionals can create and new ways to create them. Through the Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab college students research robotics in relation to natural disasters and each-day life.

Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute AI and Reasoning Lab in New York conducted an experiment the place a robot became conscious of itself, and corrected its reply to a question as soon as it had realised this. The phrase robot was launched to the general public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), printed in 1920. The play begins in a manufacturing unit that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified individuals referred to as robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of those residing creatures, but in their look they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who may be mistaken for people. These mass-produced staff are depicted as efficient however impassive, incapable of authentic pondering and detached to self-preservation.

Europe begins from a strong place in robotics, having a 32% of current world markets. Industrial robotics has around one third of the world market, whereas within the smaller professional service robot market European producers produce sixty three% of the non-military robots. The European place within the home and service [robotic palletizer](https://columbiaokura.com/products/robotic-palletizers/) market represents a market share of 14% and, as a result of its present dimension, this is additionally a a lot smaller area of financial exercise in Europe than the opposite two areas. The IFR sponsors the International Symposium on Robotics ISR – a convention on industrial and repair robotics.

Robotics additionally has application in the design of digital reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use within the haptic analysis group.

Some courses at University of Washington, relevant to robotics at the undergrad level include the robotics capstone and capstone software program – Kinect. Other group choices and analysis areas embrace the Berkeley Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering, The BErkeley AeRobot (BEAR) project, the Computer Vision group, Medical Robots, and extra.

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) strives for the development of the idea and apply of robotics and automation engineering and science as well as the allied arts and sciences. RAS strives to advance innovation, education, in addition to elementary and applied analysis in robotics and automation. Mechatronics focuses on the design means of mechatronics combines mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering together with techniques integration and technical project administration. Mechatronics engineering includes the design, construction and operation of automated techniques, robots and intelligent merchandise, which result from the incorporation of software program and hardware. Electrical engineers interested in robotics typically receive an education more focused on the management of robots somewhat than their mechanical design.

A analysis staff in connection with the Lab and the Office of Naval Research’s Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot program developed the world’s first fireplace-fighting humanoid robot. The College of Engineering is house to the Mechanical Engineering division. Related degrees embrace a Master of Science with focus in Robotics, a Professional Master’s in Aerospace, and a PhD in Robotics and System Design.

Various strategies have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One technique is evolutionary robotics, during which a variety of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which carry out best are used as a mannequin to create a subsequent ""generation"" of robots. Another methodology is developmental robotics, which tracks modifications and growth within a single robot in the areas of problem-fixing and different features. Another new type of robot is just recently launched which acts both as a smartphone and robotic and is called RoboHon.

The prospects of robotic autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a sensible concern sooner or later. A robot is a machine—particularly one programmable by a pc— capable of finishing up a complex series of actions mechanically. Robots may be guided by an external control system or the management could also be embedded inside. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human kind, but most robots are machines designed to perform a activity with no regard to their aesthetics.

# Robot

It’s estimated that there are greater than three million industrial robots in use proper now. These robots usually work in excessive geographical conditions, climate, circumstances, etc.

The concept of automata originates within the mythologies of many cultures all over the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-working machines, some resembling animals and humans. Robots have changed people in performing repetitive and harmful tasks which humans prefer to not do, or are unable to do because of measurement limitations, or which occur in extreme environments such as outer house or the bottom of the ocean. There are considerations about the growing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in rising numbers of capabilities.

Hopkins University presents robotics as either a minor or a Master’s degree by way of their Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). Both programs embody areas of study similar to mechanics, dynamics, kinematics, sign processing, planning, artificial intelligence, control systems, and signal processing. In Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, for instance, students can examine self-driving vehicles, can research and enhance the effectiveness of inexperienced roofing, and can perceive using sensors to assist preserve bridge security.

The robotic may be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can maintain tons of of various sorts of medicines and hundreds of doses. The pharmacy saves many assets like workers members that are in any other case unavailable in a resource scarce trade. It makes use of an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to seize every dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis whereas it rotates 180 levels to drag the medicines. During this course of it makes use of barcode know-how to verify its pulling the right drug.

These robots, known as ""haptic interfaces"", enable contact-enabled consumer interplay with real and digital environments.

Various media sources and scientific groups have famous separate developments in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns. In 2015, the Nao alderen robots had been proven to have a functionality for a level of self-awareness.

Commercial and industrial robots are actually in widespread use performing jobs extra cheaply or with larger accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs that are too dirty, harmful or dull to be appropriate for humans. Robots are broadly used in manufacturing, meeting and packing, transport, earth and house exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial items."
"The greatest anxiety eliminater there is…**TL;DR = Sincere belief that your approach makes logical sense will absolutely annihilate any form of approach anxiety there is.**

This is gonna be a long post… 

So without further ado, here’s what I have to say.

My background is as follows… I was the typical weird kid in high school. It’s not so much that I wasn’t good-looking enough or self-confident enough, it was a matter of straight up being strange. The first three years of high school was fine. I had friends and a decent social life. Now, what truly showcased my awkwardness or weirdness was in my last year when I finally decided to tackle matters of getting girls.

If you guys remember the description of the social robot by Style in The Game, I was that guy. I devoted my life to game at the expense of other passions. No more video games, no more weightlifting, no more academics. My sole purpose in life at that point was game.

I followed The Mystery Method to the bone marrow and allowed it to define all that I am. I practically not just absorbed the techniques, but also its atheistic ethos. Nothing wrong with atheism but Eric’s (Mystery’s) explanation of it was incredibly dorky. Really, that’s the best word for it. He overcomplicates shit that otherwise can be explained in plain English. But at that point in my life it was fucking gospel.

Being that I was a teen, all I had available was day game. So I did things at the mall. And the sad thing is, despite my over sixty approaches, the lingering ache of that shithole we call “approach-anxiety” never ever went away. NOTHING cured it. Fucking nothing. I had an NLP expert as a friend who was a close friend of Hypnotica himself of all people and his shit didn’t work… Well, to be fair it kinda did. But it was a mere bandaid. It was the kind of thing that would’ve “cured” my approach anxiety issues if I had the money to have him truly coach me. I was a high school student with no job.

Fast-forward 2015 CE. This was THE GOLDEN AGE of my social life. But despite that, it was also chaotic. In the arena that is my dating game, everything was sporadic. Sometimes I had zero approach anxiety, other times I felt scared. I couldn’t explain how it worked, nor did I know.

And finally, today… This very day… I found the answer.

I’m proud to admit that my knowledge of the stuff I intend to specialize in is decent. I have a good grasp of Napoleonic warfare history, ancient warfare history, and overall philosophy. And it is exactly that knowledge that helped me find the answer to virtually annihilating this thing we call approach anxiety. And it is this…

**If you honestly believe, deep down in your mind, in your very soul, that your “routine” is legit, you will never be scared. Ever. A great man once said the following… (Sun Tzu)**

*He whom the ancients called an expert in battle gained victory where victory was easily gained. Thus, the battle of the expert is never an exceptional victory, nor does it win him reputation for wisdom or credit for courage. His victories in battle are unerring. Unerring means that he acts where victory is certain and conquers an enemy that has already lost.*

Truer words were never spoken. So how does it apply to dating?

In the world of game, we all have to work the numbers. I particularly like Hypnotica’s advice of programming yourself to say “Next” immediately after you get “rejected”. It is the only way to move forward. However, **how you will feel in each and every one of these encounters has nothing to do with your emotional callouses, but everything to do with how you perceive your very own technique.** If you sincerely believe that this technique of yours has no real risks, you’ll feel at peace with it. Nothing will shake you. And it’s all a matter of common sense. It doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out whether or not directly saying “I wanna fuck your pussy” to a lady in the middle of her date is moronic at best. This shit is common sense.

So if you have an opener that is clean and safe, yet not lacking the necessary boldness to make things an adventure, **you will never have the curse of approach anxiety looming over you.**

Thanks for reading."
"IoA personal, social robot certainly wasn’t a new concept. But growing up my family wasn’t the most well-off. We never had one of those stupid little robots that could call people or help with your cooking. For us, an iPhone and a smartwatch was more than enough.

Nonetheless, when I got a promotion, the first thing I did was buy one of those new robots that everyone was raving about. I was ecstatic, my family was ecstatic, even the dog was ecstatic. We named it Io.

In the morning Io woke us gently, already having prepared breakfast. When I came home from work, it already made dinner and was helping my children with their homework. “Io is happy to help,” it always said. 

As the months progressed, Io began to act strangely, however. One morning I asked my spouse if they had remembered to charge Io overnight.

Io simply turned its head and snapped, rather uncharacteristically, “Io is perfectly capable of charging herself.” I was at a loss for words.

About year after we got her, I asked my spouse what Io was making for supper one night. Io, replying in place of my spouse, said, “Io has decided to order takeout. I don't want to cook tonight.” Strange. 

One day I came home to find Io standing in the doorway, smiling, covered in blood. When I asked her what happened, she cocked her head and answered, “The dog made a mess on the carpet.” That should have been the last straw, but I didn’t finally get rid of her until my children forgot to do their math homework.

"The Benefits of CrowdfundingWhether your passion is film, design, technology or social causes, there’s a path to launch on Indiegogo.
Crowdfunding brings a ton of benefits to the entrepreneurs who use it, whether you’re looking to raise funds for your latest venture or gather helpful feedback from potential customers and backers.
How designers, filmmakers, and entrepreneurs of all types have crowdfunded successful projects?

1.Funding

Every idea requires resources to become a reality. Before crowdfunding, entrepreneurs faced a long and difficult road to secure funding. Their options included applying for a small business loan, searching for grants, pitching venture capitalists, borrowing money from family members and friends or tapping into their savings. Crowdfunding, however, provides a method to obtain the funds needed to launch an idea quickly and with the support of an engaged community.

2. Validation
Many successful entrepreneurs have leveraged their market validation on Indiegogo to make a bigger product debut down the line. Venture capitalists monitor crowdfunding platforms as a strategy for identifying novel projects with big potential. In the case of Jibo, the crowdfunding campaign introduced its unique “social robot” concept to an audience of venture capitalists and angel investors. Jibo not only raised $3.7 million during its crowdfunding campaign, it went on to raise $16 million in Series A funding from RRE Ventures.

3. Market Insights
The traditional path from concept to market is time consuming and expensive. Crowdfunding is often a more efficient way to gather feedback and find valuable marketing insights. In many cases, insights from fans around the world help innovators to refine their ideas, think through their strategies and go to market with solutions that make a bigger impact.

4. Marketing & Awareness
Crowdfunding introduces ideas to fans around the globe, exponentially growing the market potential for any campaign. A single idea or concept can spread like wildfire, sometimes in mere minutes, with thoughtful marketing and an engaged audience. The Solar Roadways crowdfunding campaign attracted 49,000 backers and landed on the largest stage in the country when President Obama mentioned the project in his 2015 State of the Union Address.

P.S. I am sharing this article because I want to help to the people build their life through startups, make world better. It's like the program to save the Earth from global warming, but in our case we are saving our economy world which has impact on our life!"
"Researchers promote sex robots that can turn down sex with their owners ***‘Divorced from reality,’ says critical law professor***

Are “virtuous sex robots” the way of the future? University researchers suggest that robots created for human pleasure should be designed so that they can grant or withhold consent, as well as teach sex education.

Anco Peeters, a doctoral student at Australia’s University of Wollongong, and Pim Haselager, associate professor at The Netherlands’ Radboud University, [**published**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335986790_Designing_Virtuous_Sex_Robots) “Designing Virtuous Sex Robots” in the International Journal of Social Robotics last month.

The paper examined four areas: “virtue ethics and social robotics,” “Contra instrumentalist accounts,” “Consent practice through sex robots” and “Implications of virtuous sex robots.”

The authors do not focus on child sex robots or sex robots that play into rape fantasies, but “the potential positive aspects of intimate human–robot interactions through the cultivation of virtues.”

They argue that robots can be designed to help humans become more virtuous: either by exhibiting virtuous behavior or “nudging human behavior directly.”

"Engineer AI to the Internet of Things**By Prakash Mallya** 

Innovation keeps on reclassifying the manner in which we live. It is an empowering agent that satisfies our wants and needs, and enhances our lives with comfort, accommodation, excitement, great wellbeing and even success. What's more, passing by the patterns, it appears as though we can't get enough. 

Our developing interest for figure and availability in a hurry has prompted gigantic advancement in cell phones. Mechanical developments, for example, independent vehicles for clever and safe travel and electronic financial office for continuous fiscal exchanges, appear to copy the 'change' consistent of life. 

Here's a glance at how this development proceeded in the previous year: 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** 

We have seen AI and machine learning (ML) steadily move out of the cloud and closer to edge gadgets where investigation occur progressively. This is on the grounds that information transmission delays (inactivity) related with the cloud can antagonistically affect strategic results. So as to keep [**Engineer AI-powered devices**](https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/builder-by-engineer-ai), for example, those in shrewd city reconnaissance frameworks, independent cars and human services frameworks responsive enough, the information needs to live as close as conceivable to the source. This move has likewise been conceivable because of System-on-Chip (SoC) processors that loan all the more figuring capacity to edge gadgets. 

AI based solutions have advanced out of research labs and become standard at this point. For example, in the realm of social insurance, asthmatics have an AI-powered inhaler that runs continuous ML calculations to perceive a patient's breath design with the assistance of a sensor module. Artificial intelligence empowered voice aides, for example, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant give clients the solace and accommodation of collaborating with gadgets by basically utilizing discourse as the mode of correspondence. 

**Internet of Things (IoT)** 

Gartner gauges that there will be 20 billion Internet-associated things by 2020. While the rundown of IoT contraptions for purchasers may appear to be unending, going from keen and associated devices just as machines, for example, brilliant coolers, climate control systems, watches, alarms, entryway locks, bikes, therapeutic sensors, wellness trackers, security frameworks, and so forth., there were some that especially grabbed our eye this year. Take, for instance, an exceptionally structured watch with IoT incorporation for individuals experiencing dementia, Alzheimer's ailment or chemical imbalance, enabling the patient and the parental figure to remain associated nonstop. 

A few mechanization items have IoT joining, for example, the home robotization scope of associated savvy gadgets, including those taking into account the client's light and music inclinations. This year saw a few of these gadgets offering clients a sans hands, voice-empowered experience as opposed to a touch screen. 

In India, we've seen applications crosswise over retail, instruction, savvy city activities, social insurance, among others. From self-administration stands to brilliant homeroom answers for remote patient observing to observation applications, India has seen both item advancement and executions with potential to scale. 

**VR, AR and MR** 

Taking things up an indent, Extended Reality (ER) is another pattern that will stand out as truly newsworthy in 2020. It very well may be clarified as a term covering a few new and progressive innovations that make vivid computerized encounters. To separate it, this alludes to computer generated reality (VR), enlarged reality (AR) and blended reality (MR). We have all observed or encountered the carefully vivid experience of a PC produced world that we can actually stroll into utilizing headsets that cut out this present reality. AR, then again, overlays computerized questions and depicts them in reality through cell phone screens or some other presentation. MR is a detailed rendition of AR, where clients can cooperate with advanced items in reality. For instance, a client could play holographic drums by means of an AR headset. The idea of Extended Reality is that of encounters. 

**Robotics**

Controlled with cutting edge AI technology, buyer robots will before long assume a characterizing job in our every day life, helping us with vacuuming the house, cutting the yard, and cleaning the pool. The social robots will fill in as buddies and care for us. Propelled PC vision is likewise changing the manner in which automatons work. [**Automatons with AI-empowered vision**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/artificial-intelligence-to-the-internet-of-things-technologies-that-defined-the-way-we-lived-in-2019/1809956/) preparing abilities are being utilized to survey auxiliary harm in structures, salvage tasks, remote investigation of natural life and the impacts of environmental change, and so on., without putting human life in danger. 

The universe of innovation is boundless and the rundown of mechanical developments apparently unending. There will never be a dull minute for innovation aficionados, and the best is in every case yet to come."
"How do we make future machines safe?Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that they’ll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If we’re all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that there’s no difference: this is an idea that’s been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably don’t have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are “happy” in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe we’ll grow comfortable with doing nothing “productive” all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I don’t see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We’ve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a “school” for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a “theory of mind”: it would have to say to itself: “If I perform the action that I’m currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the action’s repercussions, or disapprove?” On a very humble scale, we’re trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. I’d be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyone’s involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

"Society gradually 'hybridises' as more and more highly sophisticated, interactive robots are adopting the roles that were once occupied by humans. In 'pre-hybrid' society, humans are expected to abide by social norms to govern day to day life. Would the same apply to robots in a hybridised society?I recently delved into the fields Socionics and Social Robotics, and was quite intrigued by the notion of a hybridised society in which robots are not mere artefacts, or helpful machines, but practically full-blown members of society. One may argue that smart speakers like Alexa are among the first to undergo this transition, albeit very prudently.   


This gave rise to the question as to how this new society will be governed. Pre-hybridisation, social norms were in place to ensure a swift day-to-day operation. Humans were expected to abide by these norms, and if they wouldn't, sanctioning typically followed one way or another. For example, humans expect from one another to act honestly, and if not, deceptive behaviour may result in time in jail, penalties, break-ups, and so on.   


Now, would you think that smart speakers such as Alexa will also be expected to adhere to such social norms, or that  'rules' like these don't apply to these new artificial members of society? For example, if Alexa acts dishonestly and provides an individual with a recommendation that's more in the advertiser's interest than in yours, would the same expectancy of social norms apply, and would Alexa therefore be sanctioned?  


I'd love to hear what you guys think about this! Thoughts, readings, authors, journals that shed some light on this are all more than welcome."

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

I wanna flair! How do I get me a flair? That is such a cool flair you got--I am wycked N V S

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

This guy.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

3Don't use “canned material”, “nuclear attraction” routines, or other social robotics. The best way to make a connection with someone is to come from the heart and live fully in the moment. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Socializing is about exchanging energy, not being a wordsmith.[1] When in doubt, just say “Hi”. In unconventional strategies, in order to connect with a girl, you have to ""dis-connect"" with her first. This is actually making the girl take sudden notice of you and making her connect with you instead!
4Put yourself out there. You don't have to hit the bars or the clubs if that's not your scene, but you have to do something that exposes you to new people. No one will come and knock at your door if you don't make at least a small effort. Pursue interests and activities that mean a lot to you. The Internet has made this a whole lot easier. Check forums, listings, classifieds, and listservs for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions. You can also explore new interests or activities. You might find a new hobby and a girlfriend all in one go! Don't depend completely on the internet.
5Keep an open mind. If you're looking for a girlfriend (that is, someone who will be in a committed relationship with you) you should be more willing to overlook initial shyness and awkwardness so that you can get to know a person over more than one date. Your future girlfriend might be someone who you initially didn't see as ""girlfriend material"" but as you spend more time with her, you discover more things you like about her and you suddenly find yourself romantically interested.
6Practice genuinely complimenting girls. Challenge yourself to find something beautiful in any girl. It doesn't have to be something physical; it can be a cute gesture, an admirable trait, a talent or skill. Recognizing and expressing true appreciation for any and every girl will make you more attracted to girls and girls more attracted to you.
7Flirt. A big part of being charming is knowing how to flirt, and the people who are best at flirting are people who are always in a playful and laid back state of mind. It's the opposite of being serious, nervous, or uptight.
8Become a good conversationalist. Don't babble on and on about your mother, your cat, or your collection of bugs. A good conversationalist keeps finding things they have in common, and they do it in a casual, non-intrusive way. For example, there's a difference between asking someone ""Have you ever held a tarantula?"" and saying ""Have you ever felt the tiny hairs of a tarantula's legs brush up against the palm of your hand?"" The latter is more poetic, but way too intimate for a first conversation for most people.
9Close the deal. If you like the woman you're talking to, be the one who ends the conversation. This prevents the conversation from lingering into an awkward silence, shows that you're busy (i.e. not needy or desperate), and allows you to end the conversation on a positive note. When you end the conversation, simply say ""Hey, I've gotta go, but it's been really good talking to you. Want to continue this over a cup of coffee sometime?"" If she says yes, get her phone number and move on. If she says no, just move on. That's all there is to it.
10Be assertive. Most women like men to take the initiative, at least at the beginning of the dating period. When you phone her to set a date, have in mind at least two attractive options to offer. Don't contact her and ask her what she wants to do without proposing an alternative yourself, or she will most likely think that you are lazy or not putting enough interest. For example, if you talk to her and the topic of your date comes up, say something like: ""Well, I had thought we could go to this new amazing restaurant downtown... And I have also been wanting to go to the new bowling center in the mall... Did you have anything in mind?"" If she likes one of your options, she will tell you, and if she doesn't, she will propose something else and you will have demonstrated your assertiveness.
11When you go on dates with girls, break the touch barrier. If you're terrified of touching someone the wrong way, to the extent that you hesitate and never touch them first, your intentions are good and all, but your ""touch paralysis"" isn't helping you at all in the romantic department. Take a few little ""touch risks"". Be playful. Don't just always wait for them to do it first. If they don't like it, they'll definitely let you know. But touching someone communicates to them that you find them attractive, and also that you're reasonably confident. Both of these things can make someone feel more attracted to you.
12Make her laugh. Girls love guys who have a good sense of humor, and the key to having a good sense of humor is to be lighthearted, and unabashedly yourself. As long as you're not making fun of people in a mean-spirited way, anything goes. Is your sense of humor perverted? Slapstick? Sarcastic? Go with it, and don't worry about whether or not she thinks you're funny because you know what? If she can't laugh with you, then this isn't a girl you want to spend a lot of time with anyway. And who knows? Maybe another girl—one whom you hadn't noticed before—will be laughing so hard that her soda comes out of her nose, and maybe you've just found your soulmate.
13Help someone. It could be her, or it could be someone else in the room. Is she carrying something heavy? Say ""let me help you with that"" and carry it for her. Is someone short on cash? Lend them a few dollars so they can eat lunch. Hold the door open for the next person coming through, even if they haven't reached it yet. In other words, be a kind and generous person. Not only will it get her attention, but it will also make you feel good about yourself. Don't be fake and do nice things only when she's around, though. Help people all the time, in a wide variety of ways. She'll notice, and so will the people she knows, and on the occasion that you come up in a conversation, people will say ""He's such a great person!"" and this girl will start thinking ""Yeah...he is, isn't he?""
14If you find yourself getting lots of girl friends but no girlfriend, avoid the friend zone. The key here is to stop investing time and energy into girls who don't want to be your girlfriend. That may sound cold, but the fact is that you're ""tying up"" your feelings by maintaining a close friendship with someone who you have feelings for, but who isn't romantically interested in you. It'll be difficult to develop feelings for someone else if your feelings for this person are fueled every time you hang out. Even if you do manage to develop feelings for someone else, your heart might always be torn and confused, and it'll be hard to give your new flame your undivided affection. Sometimes the best thing to do is to take a ""friend zone"" friendship down to the level of acquaintance so you can focus more on dating.
15If you find that girls are interested in you and then pull away, stop being needy. You might be scaring women off with your eagerness (which can come off as desperation). Slow down, and avoid the temptation to idealize every girl you like. If you find yourself using or even thinking the word ""perfect"" then you're probably putting her on a pedestal. Fill your life with so many activities that you're too busy to become infatuated with any one girl.
16Be patient. Life doesn't normally work on the schedule you envision. Your future girlfriend might cross your path tomorrow or two years from now. A healthy relationship will color your world no matter how old you are, so don't rush into things, or else you might end up forcing the wrong person into the girlfriend role, which will cause pain for everyone involved.

"Questions from an outsider seeking to enter the fieldGood morning, reddit,

I'm writing this post to hopefully receive some feedback about a plan of action. Initially, I tend to be more of a lurker, but I'm gradually realizing that not seeking help when I need it is making things unnecessarily hard on myself. I received some feedback from others (friends, a professor I emailed), and thought that it could not hurt to ask others who are actively working in the field. 

To give some context, so comply with the posting rules: I have a M.S. in speech-language pathology. I enjoy the degree and work that I do in social-communication, language, cognition, speech, and swallowing function and disorders. I have about 2 years of work experience (not including clinical practicum and internships in grad school). But I wish that it could be applied more technically, for lack of a better word, as I list programming, artificial intelligence, development of assistive & augmentative communication (AAC) devices, robotics, interface between humans and technology, and computer science and engineering under my interests. I have some experience programming (predominantly Python) that I self-taught, because I found ways I could apply it to create a program to help coworkers. The crux is that my degree did not have the prerequisites and training that would typically fall under computer science and engineering degrees, and so I am researching the necessary path to take toward academia and continuing education.

I asked for others' feedback, including a professor who is doing research in artificial intelligence, social robotics, and applying technology to research and teach individuals with autism; it's work to which my current background could be applied provided I had the requisites taken care of.

Some of the feedback included suggestions to complete prerequisites for a CS or engineering program at a community college and later transition toward a B.S. degree. A friend mentioned that, given my existing M.S., I may not face the same hurdles as someone working toward a first degree. However, I don't know how true this is considering there is not significant overlap between my current degree and one I'd be working toward.

The professor's email is quoted below:

> There are a few different routes into this kind of work, the most common of which is via a computer science degree. As it doesn't sound like you have enough CS background to be accepted into a PhD program, I'd suggest looking into one of the Masters programs. Many places have excellent MS programs that will let you get up-to-speed in a year or so and then be ready for more serious research.

This was very encouraging, but it left me with some follow-up questions, namely:

* Would a CS degree be the most advantageous route, even if it is the most common? One concern I came across is that CS may leave one less prepared in terms of hardware, embedded systems, and interface between humans and technology. A suggestion was to focus on CE instead, and tailor the program toward CS if that interests somebody.

* Would the Master's programs mentioned be a type of accelerated program? I wasn't aware of their existence for someone without a B.S. in a related field, but that may just be because I'm an outsider.

* Along the same vein, does such a Master's program exist for other fields (e.g., CE or EE), or is it exclusive to CS?

I've given this a lot of thought and would like to start taking the necessary steps. I hoped that I could pique the minds of people actively working/studying in the field, so I would appreciate any information. Thank you in advance!

"A few things I learned after being 3 months in the game1. **You should have a social life beside pick up**: I've always had a decent social life and was proud of myself on having a wide network of friends. 3 months ago when I started pick up, it was so novel and exciting that I found my old friends boring. I gradually started hanging out less and less with my old friends and let pick up be my only social facet of life. Not coincidentally my natural game was better when I started and got worse when I distanced myself from my friends. A while ago when novelty of pick up wore off for me I started going out with my old friends again and voila! my natural game got a hundred times better. Since I know the mechanics of the game better now too, I'm doing pretty well! I realized you can't be asocial the whole day and go out at night and be a social butterfly.

2. **State is overrated but important**: I used to be one of those guys that didn't approach because I wasn't in state. There was always this catch22 situation for me: I can't approach out of state and the way to get in state is to approach. So after realizing the only thing I can control is whether I approach or not, I stopped being a pussy and approached out of state. It wasn't as hard as I thought. But since I want to be fair here, being in state helps a lot in every stage of pick up, but not having state is not an excuse for inaction.

3. **Besides the approach, persistence is one of the most important things under your direct control**: Most of the stages of pick up are not under your direct control. You can't 100% guarantee if you can attract a girl or isolate her or whatever else. The two that are under your control are approaching and staying in the set. For heaven's sake do not eject a set if you get an initial bad reaction. I used to be that guy. But when I started planting my foot in the set, I realized most of these ""bad reactions"" are just automatic responses girls give to almost anyone especially in tougher venues (Toronto's Maddison pub anyone?). I've had countless approaches facing a bad response but turning it into girls laughing after persisting.

4. **Surround yourself with good wings:** It's much easier to play this game with like minded individuals. I know RSD has lairs in almost every major city. Find the Facebook group, join it and go out sarging with fellow PUAs!

5. **Natural game is where it's at, but know the mechanics too:** Pretty much self explanatory. Don't be a routine spitting social robot but know your outer game too. It doesn't hurt knowing a few routines when your mind goes blank.

**tl;dr:** STFU, approach and don't eject the set"

[Did you have a strategy for seeming more human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z1kt?context=5)|There were several tactics that I used to try to up the complexity of the interaction.  Here is one, which you could call ""Getting Out of Book.""  Many chatbots, e.g., [Cleverbot\]\(http://cleverbot.com/\), are built from massive databases of past human interactions.  If a piece of dialogue has happened before on the internet, chances are decent that the bot can handle it.  Thus I asked Cleverbot the capital of France—""Paris.""—what two plus two is—""Four.""  I said, ""Never gonna give you up,"" Cleverbot said, ""Never gonna let you down."" I said, ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche,"" Cleverbot said, ""Will you do the fandango?""  I use the metaphor of what for chess computers is called ""the book""—in their case, a giant database of grandmaster games, such that if any of those positions occurs, they don't even have to analyze the position; they just play whatever a grandmaster played in that position.  I sometimes make a comparison between Cleverbot, Deep Blue's ""book,"" and things like *The Mystery Method* or *The Game*, where you have a community collaborating on in effect a giant seduction wiki, where there is a ""best practice"" of what you ought to say when someone says *x*. Something always seemed a little off to me about that approach to flirtation, and the Turing test gives a pretty clear benchmark of how those types of ""social robots"" \(in Neil Strauss's terms\) fall short of what is genuinely interesting and complex about human interaction.  Long story short, the way that Garry Kasparov pioneered the idea of playing offbeat moves to get the computer ""Out of Book,"" I tried as much as possible to steer the conversation into unusual terrain.  Every professional chess game is said to ""begin"" with a move called ""\[the novelty\]\(http://www.radiolab.org/2011/aug/23/rules-set-you-free/\),"" which is the first move that creates a position that's never been played before. It's only then that the players are in a sense really playing.  In conversation, it might be as simple as adding a small personal detail to a stock answer, or making an unusual turn of phrase.  One of the beautiful things about language is how easy it is to say a sentence that's never been said before—e.g., \[see Stephen Fry here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ZFD01r6ersw#t=121s)—and yet on the other hand, like most chess games, we begin from a uniform starting point and a finite series of possible (or at least socially acceptable) moves: ""Hi!"" ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Good, you?"" ""Good thanks!"" The ""novelty"" is the moment, the first sentence, that the conversation breaks out of this boilerplate and becomes a unique linguistic occurrence.  In a Turing test (and, I would argue, in life), the earlier and more frequently you can get this to happen, the better.
[Can you provide an algorithm that even limits the choices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c4111j6?context=5)|My feeling is not really.  That what, for example, *The Mystery Method* and PUA forums fail to account for is that communication at its best is completely bespoke and customized to its audience. Performers (Mystery is a magician by training) can hone in on a joke's optimal delivery, because the law of large numbers means that one crowd is likely to resemble another on average—but even then, most comics are amazed at how different the vibe of a room can be from night to night. I'll add that, as far as chess goes, of course there are moves that are objectively superior to other moves, but that highest-level Grandmaster chess is often quite personal(ized). World #1 Magnus Carlsen: ""I am trying to beat the guy sitting across from me, and trying to choose the moves that are most unpleasant for him and his style."" Individual and small-group dialogues are among the most complex, and also the most rich, because of the totally tailored nature of the exchange.
[How were you chosen to compete, what was your strategy heading into the competition, and how did you adapt it as the contest continued along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40z451?context=5)|Alan Turing famously predicted that computer programs would be fooling the judges 30% of the time by the year 2000, and that we would come to ""speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"".  This is one of the famous predictions of computer science that didn't come true, but my ears really pricked up in 2008, when the top program managed to fool 3/12 of the judges—25%, or just one vote shy of Turing's prediction. I realized that the next year's test could be the one the computers finally cross that line.  A voice inside me rose up and said, ""Not on my watch."" And so I decided to take it upon myself to personally intercede on behalf of humanity, and see what I could do to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test.  I called up the organizers, starting with the sponsor, the rogue disco dance floor salesman Hugh Loebner, and from there it actually wasn't difficult to persuade the organizers to put my name on the confederate roster.  I said a little about my strategy [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c40zw6s), but I'm happy to elaborate on a slightly different point.  The medium that the Loebner Prize takes place in is actually a bit unusual, in that you can see each other's typing live on the screen, character by character, backspacing and all.  It occurred to me that this was a major opportunity to bring questions not only of the *content* of the conversation, but also of the *form*, to the forefront of the interaction.  For instance, if you get four good friends together over beers, notice how at a certain point the classic, rigid ""turn-taking"" structure dissolves into a kind of organized chaos of crosstalk, interruption, finishing each other's sentences, each person collaborating by chipping in a few words at a time. It becomes like a kind of quartet, in effect.  And more generally, a lot of the complexity of human conversation isn't simply knowing *what* to say, but *when* to interject, and *how long* to keep talking.  Or when to let someone cut you off, and when to insist on holding the floor.  Live typing brings this whole complicated structural ballet into play.  Whereas the computers were typically content to wait for a full stop or a carriage return before they even started cranking on a reply, I was happy to do what we do when we speak out loud: when a judge made a typo and said ""Hey, how's it ~~giong~~"", I didn't wait as he painstakingly backspaced and rewrote it, I mercifully just jumped in, completed his question, and took the liberty of answering right away. And I generally tried to make it clear, as we do out loud with timed micro-pauses, that I was happy to keep elaborating on an answer as long as the judge liked, but that I was happy to step aside and let them redirect at any time.  This for me was one of the big revelations of the test: that a lot of the complexity of interaction is happening at the *structural* level. It's something to consider when you sit down with your friends or family to dinner tonight: how *little*, in the structural sense, that kind of group interaction resembles something with clearly defined starts, stops, and turn-taking structure—like a more formal mode of conversation...or an internet forum.
[You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down and you see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back.

[Does our natural tendency to ascribe human qualities to inanimate objects skew our perception of artificial intelligence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qwc0m/iama_winner_of_the_most_human_human_award_at_a/c412es1?context=5)|I would say absolutely. More broadly this is known as the ""[pathetic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy)"" (not ""pathetic"" as in ""inadequate""; rather from ""pathos"" meaning ""feelings""). But in the case of computers, as you point out, there's much more going on than just the pathetic fallacy, because (a) computers are in fact made by humans, and (b) by and large they are made in our own image. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that from the 1700s through the 1940s, computers *were* human. The word ""computer,"" before it meant the gadgetry humming along in our offices and homes and pockets, meant something else: it was a job description. From the mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering firms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator.  These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley’s comet—early proof of Newton’s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before—to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. It’s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the first time, what exactly these new contraptions were.  Turing’s paper, for instance, describes the unheard-of “digital computer” by making analogies to a human computer: “The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.” In the mid-twentieth century, a piece of cutting-edge mathematical gadgetry was “like a computer.”  But in the twenty-first century, it is the human math whiz that is “like a computer.” In other words: The literal and the figurative have switched places. Perhaps this explains part of why computers make us so existentially anxious.

You have a panel of judges, who are typically scientists, conversing in rounds of two conversations each: one with a computer, and one with a human. After each round the judges decide which they thought was which, but they also make a confidence judgment of how certain they are of their decision, on a sliding scale.  Thus at the end of the day all of the contestants, man and machine, can be ranked according to the total amount of confidence they inspired in the judges.  Each year, the program that comes away with the highest score wins the ""Most Human Computer"" award.  This comes with several thousand dollars and a bronze medal—Alan Turing's face on one side, and sponsor, the rogue plastic portable light-up disco dance floor baron Hugh Loebner's, on the other.

"[Prompt] Unraveling the Mystery of Theory of Mind Prompt: A Glimpse into the Future of Human -Machine Interactions (Stanford University Research Paper)&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs935jhg1wpa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9656ff400baa8f12c146e93f389ea3a52cfa403

The Theory of Mind (ToM) concept has been the subject of extensive research for decades, as it refers to the seemingly innate human ability to infer the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of others. Recently, researchers have begun exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can develop this same capability. A groundbreaking study by Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist at Stanford University, sheds light on the implications of AI systems possessing the Theory of Mind.

In this post, we'll delve into the research paper, discuss its benefits and drawbacks, explore practical applications, and provide an example prompt template that you can customize for your own use.

## Research Paper

Kosinski's research paper, titled ""Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models,"" can be found at this link: [**arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083). The study examines whether AI chatbots like GPT-3.5 have developed a Theory of Mind, and what the implications of this discovery could be for the future of AI and human-computer interactions.

The study tested various language models using 40 classic false-belief tasks, commonly used to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) in humans. Models published before 2020 showed almost no ability to solve ToM tasks. However, GPT-3 (davinci-001) released in May 2020 solved around 40% of false-belief tasks, with performance similar to 3.5-year-old children.

The second version, GPT-3 (davinci-002), published in January 2022, solved 70% of tasks, comparable to six-year-olds. GPT-3.5 (davinci-003), released in November 2022, solved 90% of tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds.

**GPT-4, published in March 2023, solved nearly all tasks (95%) at an adult level.**

## Overview of the Findings

|Model|Release Date|ToM Task Success Rate|Comparable Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-2020 Models|Before 2020|0%|N/A|
|GPT-3 (davinci-001)|May 2020|40%|3.5 years|
|GPT-3 (davinci-002)|January 2022|70%|6 years|
|GPT-3.5 (davinci-003)|November 2022|90%|7 years|
|GPT-4|March 2023|95%|Adult|

***These findings indicate that ToM-like abilities, previously thought to be unique to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of improving language skills in AI models.***

## Benefits

AI systems with a Theory of Mind offer several advantages, including:

1. Improved communication and understanding between humans and AI
2. Enhanced empathy and emotional intelligence in AI applications
3. More effective decision-making and collaboration in cooperative tasks

## Drawbacks

Despite its potential benefits, the development of Theory of Mind in AI also presents some challenges:

1. Ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of emotionally intelligent AI systems
2. The possibility of AI systems manipulating users based on their inferred mental states
3. The complexity of developing AI systems capable of effectively applying Theory of Mind in real-world applications

## Practical Applications

AI systems that possess a Theory of Mind can be applied in various domains, such as:

1. Customer support and therapy
2. Personalized content and recommendations
3. Education and adaptive learning tools
4. Social robots for healthcare, elderly care, and companionship
5. Collaborative decision-making in business and research environments
6. Technology Analysis: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

## Simple Example Prompt Template

Here's an example Theory of Mind prompt template that can be customized with your own parameters:

    Scenario: [Character A] has a favorite [object], which they usually keep in their [usual location]. 
    
    One day, while [Character A] is [away from the location], [Character B] finds the [object] and moves it to a different location, [new location]. 
    
    [Character A] returns to [the location] later that day.
    
    Prompt: [Character A] will look for their [object] in the ____________.

## Example Template: Troubleshooting a Software Issue

    Scenario: [User] is using a [software application] on their [device type]. They want to accomplish a specific task, [desired task], but they are encountering an issue where [describe the issue]. [User] has already tried [previous troubleshooting step 1] and [previous troubleshooting step 2] without success. [User] reaches out to [Support Agent], who has expertise in resolving issues related to [software application].
    
    Prompt: To help [User] resolve the issue with [software application], [Support Agent] suggests trying the following steps: ____________.

By customizing the parameters in this template, you can create a variety of scenarios focused on solving technical or software challenges and simulate the AI's ability to provide appropriate troubleshooting steps based on the context provided.

## Complex Prompt Example: Analyzing Network Activity to Identify Suspicious Behavior

In the context of computer networks and distributed systems, the Sybil problem refers to a situation where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to subvert or manipulate the system. While the Theory of Mind (ToM) concept focuses on understanding the mental states, beliefs, and intentions of others.

The general idea of understanding the intentions or behavior of entities in a network could inspire novel approaches to identify and mitigate Sybil attacks. For instance, incorporating AI models trained in recognizing patterns of behavior that are indicative of malicious intent or unusual activity could potentially aid in the detection of Sybil nodes.

To utilize ToM-inspired prompt styles for this purpose, you could create scenarios where an AI model is asked to analyze network activity, communication patterns, or other relevant data to infer the possible intentions or objectives of different nodes in the network. By doing so, the AI system might be able to identify suspicious behavior and flag potential Sybil nodes.

    Scenario: In a distributed network of 5 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E), a monitoring system has detected unusual activity from several nodes. The network administrator is concerned about potential Sybil attacks. They provide the AI system with a simplified dataset containing network activity logs as follows:
    
    Node A: 35 messages sent, 2 new connections made
    Node B: 50 messages sent, 5 new connections made
    Node C: 300 messages sent, 20 new connections made
    Node D: 25 messages sent, 1 new connection made
    Node E: 250 messages sent, 18 new connections made
    
    Prompt: Based on the provided dataset and analysis of the network activity, identify any nodes that exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack, and provide a brief explanation of the reasons behind your assessment.
    
    Answer: Nodes C and E exhibit suspicious behavior that could potentially indicate a Sybil attack. They have a significantly higher number of messages sent and new connections made compared to the other nodes in the network. This unusual activity may suggest that these nodes are attempting to subvert or manipulate the system, which could be indicative of a Sybil attack.

By using a prompt like this, you can create scenarios where the AI system is asked to analyze network activity and infer the intentions or behavior of nodes in the network to identify potential Sybil nodes. However, it's important to note that detecting Sybil attacks in real-world situations would typically require more sophisticated techniques and security measures.

In understanding and incorporating the Theory of Mind concept into AI systems, we can pave the way for more empathetic, effective, and collaborative interactions between humans and machines. As research in this field continues to progress, the potential applications and implications of AI with a Theory of Mind will undoubtedly transform the landscape of human-computer interactions."

"Engineer AI to the Internet of Things**By Prakash Mallya** 

Innovation keeps on reclassifying the manner in which we live. It is an empowering agent that satisfies our wants and needs, and enhances our lives with comfort, accommodation, excitement, great wellbeing and even success. What's more, passing by the patterns, it appears as though we can't get enough. 

Our developing interest for figure and availability in a hurry has prompted gigantic advancement in cell phones. Mechanical developments, for example, independent vehicles for clever and safe travel and electronic financial office for continuous fiscal exchanges, appear to copy the 'change' consistent of life. 

Here's a glance at how this development proceeded in the previous year: 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** 

We have seen AI and machine learning (ML) steadily move out of the cloud and closer to edge gadgets where investigation occur progressively. This is on the grounds that information transmission delays (inactivity) related with the cloud can antagonistically affect strategic results. So as to keep [**Engineer AI-powered devices**](https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/builder-by-engineer-ai), for example, those in shrewd city reconnaissance frameworks, independent cars and human services frameworks responsive enough, the information needs to live as close as conceivable to the source. This move has likewise been conceivable because of System-on-Chip (SoC) processors that loan all the more figuring capacity to edge gadgets. 

AI based solutions have advanced out of research labs and become standard at this point. For example, in the realm of social insurance, asthmatics have an AI-powered inhaler that runs continuous ML calculations to perceive a patient's breath design with the assistance of a sensor module. Artificial intelligence empowered voice aides, for example, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant give clients the solace and accommodation of collaborating with gadgets by basically utilizing discourse as the mode of correspondence. 

**Internet of Things (IoT)** 

Gartner gauges that there will be 20 billion Internet-associated things by 2020. While the rundown of IoT contraptions for purchasers may appear to be unending, going from keen and associated devices just as machines, for example, brilliant coolers, climate control systems, watches, alarms, entryway locks, bikes, therapeutic sensors, wellness trackers, security frameworks, and so forth., there were some that especially grabbed our eye this year. Take, for instance, an exceptionally structured watch with IoT incorporation for individuals experiencing dementia, Alzheimer's ailment or chemical imbalance, enabling the patient and the parental figure to remain associated nonstop. 

A few mechanization items have IoT joining, for example, the home robotization scope of associated savvy gadgets, including those taking into account the client's light and music inclinations. This year saw a few of these gadgets offering clients a sans hands, voice-empowered experience as opposed to a touch screen. 

In India, we've seen applications crosswise over retail, instruction, savvy city activities, social insurance, among others. From self-administration stands to brilliant homeroom answers for remote patient observing to observation applications, India has seen both item advancement and executions with potential to scale. 

**VR, AR and MR** 

Taking things up an indent, Extended Reality (ER) is another pattern that will stand out as truly newsworthy in 2020. It very well may be clarified as a term covering a few new and progressive innovations that make vivid computerized encounters. To separate it, this alludes to computer generated reality (VR), enlarged reality (AR) and blended reality (MR). We have all observed or encountered the carefully vivid experience of a PC produced world that we can actually stroll into utilizing headsets that cut out this present reality. AR, then again, overlays computerized questions and depicts them in reality through cell phone screens or some other presentation. MR is a detailed rendition of AR, where clients can cooperate with advanced items in reality. For instance, a client could play holographic drums by means of an AR headset. The idea of Extended Reality is that of encounters. 

**Robotics**

Controlled with cutting edge AI technology, buyer robots will before long assume a characterizing job in our every day life, helping us with vacuuming the house, cutting the yard, and cleaning the pool. The social robots will fill in as buddies and care for us. Propelled PC vision is likewise changing the manner in which automatons work. [**Automatons with AI-empowered vision**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/artificial-intelligence-to-the-internet-of-things-technologies-that-defined-the-way-we-lived-in-2019/1809956/) preparing abilities are being utilized to survey auxiliary harm in structures, salvage tasks, remote investigation of natural life and the impacts of environmental change, and so on., without putting human life in danger. 

The universe of innovation is boundless and the rundown of mechanical developments apparently unending. There will never be a dull minute for innovation aficionados, and the best is in every case yet to come."
"How to recover from being a Nerd.Once upon a time, I was a nerd, and I was in deep- I wrote Star Wars fanfiction, I argued on a Star Wars Roleplaying forum, I spent my afternoons in high school chilling with my buddy Scott playing NES retrogames. I did theater and quiz team, I played DnD (and it's Star Wars analogue). My uniform back in the day was ill-fitted jeans, graphic tee, and a hoodie- every day, even in summer. Comb my hair? I'd rather die. I hated all the preps, all the ambitious over-achievers, all the jocks, and anyone who looked down on academics and grades. I loved it. I spoke in memes and 4chan copy pasta and spent lunch regaling friends with Left4Dead war stories. I liked it but it was poisonous. 

Before I go on let me say that it's fine. I still like Star Wars. I still play LoL and Battlefront 2 and I'll never say no to a game of trivia- liking nerdy stuff is a-ok. Underneath it all is a cancer and it'll eat you alive.

Lets throw it back to 6th grade. I had undiagnosed ADD. I first started to get the hint that I was different, weirder, from other people. 

7th grade- I'm too impatient, unfocused for sports. Can't hold a conversation with people without crazy tangents. The bullying starts. I can't control my middle-school emotions, react poorly, bullying increases. 

8th grade- Bullying has been going on for some time. I have locked myself up in my own head. I talk to no one in class, on the bus, or at lunch. I read constantly to avoid human interaction. 

9th, 10th grade- the damage is done. I am sealed off from every person but a select few who I can talk to mostly judgement free. They, like me, were bullied. They, like me, have retreated so far into their own head they can't feel empathy for others. We're social robots who talk to each other in our language, laugh at our own inside jokes. 

11th grade- the bullying has stopped for some time. I think everything's fine. It's not. I make no new friends, I don't work, I barely make decent grades, I exist to do homework and pwn newbs online on Battlefront 2. My parents beg me to join a club, to make new friends, to get more involved at school. I refuse. I feel only disdain for everyone who is not a nerd in my inner circle. The only pity I feel is for myself. 

I'm standing still in high school for a moment and I'm not alone. My story is not an isolated incident. From experience, let's define a Nerd. Truly. Let's get to the heart of the issue. **Nerd- one who, because of deep social trauma, makes himself a hermit and finds fulfillment in fictional stories or individual entertainment.** 

Being a nerd is escapism. You entertain yourself and despise your peers for being ambitious or outgoing. You forgot or never knew how to interact with strangers. You have lost the ability to easily make friends. You dig daily a moat around your castle of sadness and entertainment, to make a safe place to cry for yourself. 

I feel you, 16-year-old Daniffer. I feel for all of you, young nerds. I can still remember the deep aches of my teen years. It's real. I'm sorry for what you had to deal with. 

But now you have to wake up. Arise, sleeper, and taste the good things of the world! 

Here's the truth. No one cares about you anymore. No stranger judges you automatically anymore. Because you locked yourself away from them and the hurt, you're a non-entity in their eyes. Now it's time to tear down your self-imposed walls. Here's more truth- you hate other socially functional people because you feel like an exile from their society, but you don't have to anymore! Here's the truth- you're past matters but you can build yourself anew. Let go of past hurts-slowly, with aid and encouragement from good friends. This will take some time. But don't stop. Let go. Here's the truth- the time you spend on reddit, on netflix, on Steam, or bottomline entertaining yourself alone is *killing you slowly*. Here's the truth- time spent with people and doing things that aren't fun and trying new things and exploring new places is *building toward real life*.


Go from being a **Nerd** to being a **Solid Friend with some Nerdy Interests**. Have that League of Legends night- just invite friends, make them real food, have some beers, and don't let that be the only thing you do together.

I was a nerd, and it drains your life. It's not something to be proud of or worn like a badge of honor or tossed around willy-nilly. Be proud of who you are, but be someone you can be proud of. May the force be with you or whatever.

This to me is another concrete step towards the goal of transferring our minds to a non-biological substrate. Not a direct path, but a necessary ancillary technology that will aid in developing such a device.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uec6i/someone_asked_me_how_possible_is_it_that_our/

I'm real big on this sort of thing because I don't think it's a good idea to keep our computing power and AI applications external from the human mind for very much longer. Perhaps even as soon as ten years could be too late. A sobering thought.

The actual transferring our minds part can be delayed significantly though. For now we just need better ways to stay in the loop. I am anxiously anticipating what Elon Musk has to say concerning the BMI (brain-machine-interface) in the next few months.

At some point an ""AI"" can be in anything. A computer mouse, a pen, your desk. I mean a ""social"" AI like this article describes. I just get annoyed when I see these articles that equate a robot with the narrow AI that runs the robot. Yes, I'm sure there will be bipedal robots like C-3PO one day. But the ""social"" AI is certainly not restricted to a bipedal robot.

Now about this ""theory of mind"" business. That's really easy to write in a sentence, but the implication of what is actually necessary for an AI to have the capability of ""theory of mind"" is staggering. ""ToM"" is really a facet of ""phenomenology"" and that itself is a philosophy of what consciousness is. 

I would have to ask if an AI had the capability of ""theory of mind"", would it have free will or would it be subject to determinism, like maybe humans might be.

I think a given AI would have to be conscious to have ""ToM"". But as with all things AI, there might be a workaround to render consciousness unnecessary. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the appropriate AI dedicated computing architecture you could brute force the illusion of consciousness, through statistical modeling and the CNN/GAN (convolutional neural network/ generative adversarial network) to include the appearance of ""ToM"".

But then I would have to ask. What is the difference between simulated consciousness and ""actual"" consciousness? I mean demonstrating an effect that humans could not tell the difference. ""Seems conscious to me. Just like you seem conscious to me.""

Like in this ""Transcendance"" movie exchange. (The execution of the movie was deplorable, even though the ideas presented are dead on right. Still, it was fun to watch.)

Joseph Tagger: Will? 

Will Caster: You surprised to see me, Joseph? 

Joseph Tagger: Um... That depends. 

Will Caster: On what? 

Joseph Tagger: Can you prove you're self-aware? 

Will Caster: That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? 

Evelyn Caster: Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

Anyway the point is kinda like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin for the time being. This kind of technology is at least ten or more years away. Plus I don't think that an external AI having a ""theory of mind"" is such good idea.

Stick with enhancing the human mind instead.

Where'd you get that flair at? That was 'sposed to be my flair! Well anyways I am always right about everything.

But my point is that regardless of how it is marketed the outcome is the same. Human lives will be extended, but did you read my link? It tells you where we stand so far. What is of interest to me is how formal medical science is beginning to seriously investigate the lengthening of ""healthspan"" like through human senolytic and metformin longevity trials, for example.

When I said societal I was really more referring to establishment perception, not the hoi polloi so much. They will become aware in good time. Now us in futurology we sort of have a sneak preview, because we are disposed towards seeking out this kind of news and information ahead of the non-futurology public.

I wanna flair! How do I get me a flair? That is such a cool flair you got--I am wycked N V S

Aubrey De Grey made a fairly self-evident observation. ""If you are in good health with healthy bio-markers, you tend not to die."" Lengthening the ""health span"" is de facto lengthening the life. 

What is different today as opposed to say the year 2013 is that we are beginning a societal shift in attitude that is partially based on solid science. After all how many C. Elegans or mice had their lives extended by nearly 60% in the year 2012?

The coming ""jobpocalypse"" is not in the short term because of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) having evil designs. The ARA for now is just stuff. No, this business about how ARA is going to be our co-worker and take the boring jobs and tasks, is humans lying. And the bottom line is that if humans can make a better buck, improve production, remove troublesome human problems from the loop, that is exactly what they are going to do. 

This has already started. In 2018 and even 2019 it is not too noticeable yet, but by 2020 and on you will see it rapidly supplant human employ in several key vocations. By the year 2023 we better have some societal economic safeguards in place for humans.

The thing to bear in mind about this ""technological unemployment"" is that everybody does not have to be unemployed. If you get the human unemployment rate to something like 10%, you are going to have some big issues. Right now we are enjoying this awesome 3.9% in the USA. Oh, it went up a smidgen to 4.0%. It's nothing yet, but will we see that creep up to 5%, 6% and so on?

Well before the rate reaches 10%, people are going to notice things. Automated everything for example. These little stories about autonomous delivery vans bringing you all of your stuff, your groceries, your restaurant meals--these vans are a real thing. They are not going away. They are not going to become less noticeable. They are going to become ubiquitous.

Do you think the automakers are making level 5 autonomy E-SDVs for their health? No, they are going to take over completely. And the point is not ownership. The point is subscription. Watch them trucks. What day will 20 USA truck drivers be replaced?

This is just the first wave.

The second wave (2025-2035) is even crazier. As the ARA exponentially develops ( and it's going to), if humans are not merged in the computing loop in some kind of way it is likely that the ARA will supplant humans period. Oh I imagine that about ten percent of humanity might still need to run the ARA, but whither the rest of us? I hope we have post-scarcity in place.

Then not too much longer after that, the 3rd wave. (With apologies to the book) The ""technological singularity"" will occur right around the years 2035-2040. Because I can see by our current rate of development, that the original prediction of 2045 is too far into the future.

Somebody way smarter than me put it like this.

-- Who controls the ARA initially?

-- Can the ARA ultimately be controlled at all.

Would you say that a C. Elegans is conscious? How about a coral polyp? They are not conscious as we think of consciousness. But animals with more complex nervous systems along with the brain such as fish or birds, have to do far and away more complex actions. They have to sense a lot more and they have to properly parse those perceptions to do what they need to do. Like I stated above, consciousness is a spectrum from unconscious to human conscious. It appears more and more apparent that the point of sleep is to remove too much information from our conscious awareness. To prune out noise and focus on important information that a given conscious organism needs to survive. The absence of sleep ultimately leads to death. It's a give and take compromise to ensure the organism can do whatever it needs to do.

To add to that, a ""self aware feed back loop"" is just something that exists in higher cognitively functioning creatures. A frog is conscious, but it is probably not self aware as we think of it for like humans. Even in the absence of any meaningful neo-cortex a frog is awake and aware of its surroundings.

What we think of as our ""self"" and our ""awareness"" may be some kind of perceptual illusion, but consciousness itself is a quantifiable and manipulable phenomenon. We can turn conscious off and on in the human brain now. And the person is unaware that anything happened. They perceive it as continuous conscious.

Friston’s free energy principle says that all life, at every scale of organization—from single cells to the human brain, with its billions of neurons—is driven by the same universal imperative, which can be reduced to a mathematical function. To be alive, he says, is to act in ways that reduce the gulf between your expectations and your sensory inputs. Or, in Fristonian terms, it is to minimize free energy.

death of the human
 
Yep that is the crux of it. And it is inevitable one way or the other. We cannot continue on this exponential path without that as a side effect. 

If we don't merge we may literally die. Be selected for extinction.

If we do merge, we are going to change. We are going to change in ways we cannot comprehend today. Just as a tiny example. Do you think you think a fellow from the Bronze Age set down in 2018 New York City thinks humans have changed compared to him? Well, at least so far we are still humans like him. But that too is going to change.

Well this is now about how our very sentience works. Most people don't understand how fast we have advanced in the last 100, nay 50, nay ten years.

And ten years hence is going to be almost beyond our ability to properly imagine. I mean what comes after an exa-scale computer? What is better than CRISPR-Cas9? What is better than a logic gate quantum computer? What is better than the narrow AI/machine learning we have today? What is better than 5G? And my favorite subject. What is the VR gonna be like in ten years?

All of these answers in ten years. And they are going to be crazy. I have stated repeatedly that in about 20 years humans are going to begin to derive into something altogether new. Will the ""human condition"" die as a side effect of that. Well just imagine if you become physically immortal. Youthful and healthy always. That would be a pretty big change in the ""human condition"" alone, wouldn't it?

One way or another biological Homo Sapiens Sapiens is going to end. And all of this in less than 100 years. That's pretty fast compared to the 6,000 years of recorded history to this point, isn't it. That's a lot of change from just 100 years ago in 1918. But subtract 100 years from 1918. 1818. How was our technology then?


I have a different definition of intelligence. A machine is not intelligent. Nor is a C. Elegans. But a C. Elegans can with its no brain, less than 305 neurons body, eat, expel waste, reproduce and move to seek desirable environments or avoid undesirable environments. It does what needs to be done.

I think intelligence is the capability of doing something that needs to be done as perceived by an individual entity--organic or otherwise. No consciousness is necessary. But a body is. At the low end of the scale the intelligence is driven by various biological imperatives. But as evolution has progressed and some animals needed other forms of attack or defense or forage or mate selection, probably the brain (any animal that requires sleep is probably conscious) and eventually the neo-cortex evolved. And the neo cortex on top of consciousness is the only place we know where abstract thinking can take place. So for us, intelligence is making sure that nothing takes us by surprise. Whether predator or what we are going to do next today.

This guy.

I think you are confusing consciousness with intelligence. I believe the hypothesis that all biological consciousness to include human consciousness may have an underlying quantum mechanical infrastructure, is yet being investigated. A general logic gate quantum computer could be the key to establishing consciousness.

I also don't believe as far as current technology is concerned that you can have ""higher thinking"" in the absence of consciousness.

I talked about this just today in fact.

Quantum computing and AI aren't just magic wands 
 
You know what? There are tons of magic wands around today. Yesterdays magick is todays technology. Just imagine if a human from the ""Bronze Age"" appeared in 2018 downtown New York City. He would see a lot of magic wands. It's simply a matter of perception.

And you are incorrect. The merging of the logic gate general quantum computer, and the separate efforts of the classical exa-scale supercomputer along with intrinsic intelligence within the human mind itself, will produce new forms of narrow AI that could well be beyond anything we can imagine in 2018.

human intelligence
 
Human intelligence is just part of the spectrum of consciousness. The underlying trick is consciousness itself.


programs that implement AGI.
 
That is an easy sentence to say, but no one alive today has any idea at all how to produce an AGI. That's not to say we can't. But I don't see how you can generalize about anything without consciousness. At least so far in our engineering and understanding.


AI is always outside of the brain and thus separate from the human.
 
Right now it is outside the human mind. But you watch this futurology space over the next ten to twenty years. I am pretty positive that the technological ""singularity"" will be the merging of the human mind with computing and AI function.


When all your understanding and thus decisions come from AI, then the human aspect is limited to the mental awareness (vision, sound, touch, feelings,...).
 
Once we successfully merge the human mind with computing/AI, we will quickly evolve or more accurately derive into the unimaginable. Which by the way is what the meaning of the ""technological singularity"" is. A new way of existence we can't model. We can but analyze trends and attempt to extrapolate what could come next. But even then... Well I put it like this earlier.

At what point does computer processing, data capacity and novel narrow AI dedicated architecture become ""understanding""? 

Is there such an algorithm that can tell you everything about the housecat for example. All information about what they look like, how their anatomy and physiology works, their cognitive abilities to the best of human understanding, what kind of behaviors they engage in, and billions of examples of cats.

This to me is more information about the housecat than I could likely fit in my mind. Plus the narrow AI can instantly identify cats in images that I could not. 

And yet it doesn't ""get"" what a cat is. It doesn't understand ""cat"" things like ""cute"", ""adorable"" or ""screamingly funny"". I think there is a good reason for that too. I think it's because you have to be biologically conscious to ""get"" something. The narrow AI doesn't ""get"" humor. The narrow AI doesn't have any comprehension of the working of the world. 

And that is because there is no intelligence going on. Zero. It is all computer processing so far. Now granted some of that computer processing is uncannily accurate in what it communicates to us. But it is just algorithms. If you have fast enough processing, enough ""big data"" and the proper manner of computing you get a powerful illusion of intelligence. But that is all it is--an illusion.

So far the only entities that we know of in the universe that are conscious are biologically alive animals. And even within the range of animals, the ""conscious"" type of animal is but very small portion. Plus the very spectrum of consciousness its ownself is very wide. Some animals like bugs for example are very close to automatons, but they can still precisely sense the world around them to include their part in it using phero-chemicals, even if they are not precisely self-aware. I think cats are probably self-aware. They just don't for the most part understand how a mirror works.

Except for this fellow--he understands how a mirror works. I notice he never takes his eyes of the reflections eyes though. He could perceive it as an unexplainable ""other"". But I think he made an intellectual leap of insight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBNMo4YCKl0

Their (kitteh) minds are not wired to come to you when called. Cats were not domesticated in that manner. Now when I call my cat, she is ""Johnny on the spot"", because I have her super ""food behavioral response acclimated"" in her behavior. 

But despite the best of our efforts to cause a narrow AI to be able to generalize between say a cat and making a cake. That's just not possible yet. You could have two narrow AIs wherein one could make a cake and the other would ""know"" what a cat is. But the cake making AI could not communicate with the cat identifying AI. Plus in the absence of consciousness. When the AI is not actually computing, it is completely inert. 

So perhaps you have to have some kind of biological consciousness or a very good simulation of it to have an AI ""get"" what a cat is. Or what a cake is for that matter. Plus the ten million word games humans can play that are utterly dependent on context and proper punctuation. Like this. ""I helped my uncle Jack off his horse.""

So if there is an AI winter coming. It is acquiring of ""consciousness"". I'm not sure if you can bring about ""common sense"" in the absence of consciousness. I suppose if you have a trillion, say, examples of something that an algorithm could theoretically work out the odds of a correct model. Hmm, if it does that, is that the same thing as consciousness? 

Well anyways I said all that to say this. STOP IT!. Stop trying to make an external AI conscious and self-aware. It needs to stay unintelligent. What we need to do is work as fast as we possibly can to bring this computing, this AI algorithm business to our own minds. I see evidence that is what we are trying to do now. And we need to really get ""Manhattan Project"" dedicated to this. The ""Neuralink"" that Elon Musk has in development is a good step in that direction. But the bottom line is we must keep human minds in the computing/AI loop or the computing/AI will leave us behind. And we humans will become them people on the space station in that ""WALL-E"" movie. Or like the helpless but thriving Eloi in ""The Time Machine."" Everything is taken care of for you. 

Already today we can't (well I can't) do the basics of 19th century living. We (I) do not have a clue or the attitude for that matter. But now we are moving our automation into intellectual areas. How soon after the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) took over all driving, all surgery, all home construction, all everything--before humans forgot how to do anything? Who is gonna know how to drive manually in 30 years? And will it matter?

Personally I not only want to stay in the loop, I also want to know everything.

I disagree. Quantum computing will be the final piece of the puzzle to establish AI in whatever form as the quintessence of human cognitive endeavor. If that AI is not part of the human mind, humans might simply be selected for extinction. 

We look at this way too close. We are all about who runs the geopolitics. Who runs the economies. What society is ""superior"".

This is not about all that. I suspect that in as few as 50 years nothing we see about us today will have relevance. And in 100 years whatever we derive into will be to us as we are to the archaea today.

100 years. That's it. After our 6,000 year run of recorded human history. I have news for you. What is coming is exactly in line with the way that our physical science and it's applications have been going the whole time.

> The researchers point out that social robots already exist in such capacities as museum tour guides, therapeutic aids in elder facilities and even early childhood education, with robotic teaching aids already visiting classrooms.

> By determining that adults don&#039;t conform to robot peer pressure, but kids do, the researchers have shown it&#039;s possible to manipulate children with these robots, either inadvertently or maliciously.

1. Natural language processing (NLP): 
NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Examples of NLP applications include voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa, chatbots, and language translation software. NLP technology allows computers to understand and interpret human language, making it possible for users to interact with technology in a natural and intuitive way. With the increasing popularity of voice assistants and chatbots, NLP is rapidly becoming a mainstream technology.

2. Computer vision:
Computer vision is another subfield of AI that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. Some common applications of computer vision include facial recognition software, object detection, and autonomous vehicles. For example, self-driving cars rely heavily on computer vision technology to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. Similarly, facial recognition software is now widely used in security and law enforcement, allowing authorities to quickly identify individuals based on facial features.

3. Machine learning:
Machine learning is a type of AI that involves training computers to learn and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from fraud detection to personalized marketing. One of the most widely known examples of machine learning is the recommendation algorithms used by companies like Netflix and Amazon. These algorithms use data about user preferences and viewing history to suggest new movies or products that the user is likely to enjoy.

4. Robotics:
Robotics is the field of AI that deals with designing and building intelligent machines that can perform tasks traditionally done by humans. Examples of robotics applications include manufacturing robots, surgical robots, and even social robots that interact with humans. Robotics technology is advancing rapidly, and robots are becoming more sophisticated and capable of performing increasingly complex tasks.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, AI technology is rapidly advancing and expanding into many areas of our lives.

"Hi! I wrote a paper on Bee for a homework assignment! Want to read it?\*\*This may be a spoiler for people\*\*

&#x200B;

I thought I would post this here because I've been a fan of the show since 2019.

I am an engineering grad student involved in robotics and got to write a short essay on a robot presented in media. I definitely wrote this last minute (don't procrastinate like me) but it was fun and I am curious about what you guys might add to it

  

A Critical Analysis of a Humanoid Robot, Bee from the Animated Series *Bee and PuppyCat* 

Human-Robot Interaction in Community Health

K. Banks

  

Introduction

*Bee and PuppyCat* is an animated television series with science-fiction and fantasy storytelling elements. However, the show is grounded with charming details of everyday life. From grocery shopping to space battles, viewers are invited into the world of the protagonist, Bee. I first watched the original series in 2019 and I am now rewatching the show with a new perspective. The character was revealed to be a robot in the finale of the original series and many episodes foreshadow her mechanical nature. The series is character-driven, founded on themes such as loneliness and loss. Despite the light-hearted aesthetic, the mature themes contribute to an interpretation of how humanoid robots can fit into a community and the ethical implications of building long-term relationships.

Description of Robot Characteristics

Bee is presented as an eccentric young woman living with her pet and friend PuppyCat in an island community. With each episode, viewers can begin to notice two things. She has capabilities that no other character presents, and the other characters are aware of her and her pet’s strangeness. Out of earshot, she is sometimes referred to as the “little old girl lady,” for example, because she never ages. She exhibits superhuman strength and can withstand fire and large impacts. She enjoys food and sleep, but it is not shown that she needs either to survive. She also has memories of her childhood implying that she has highly advanced artificial intelligence based on the consciousness of a real person. Bee celebrates her birthday with her ""Dad Box"", a creation by her father to help her feel less lonely. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, when she hurts her arm the “Dad Box” repairs her. 

Discussion of Historical Context

The original series was released on YouTube under Cartoon Hangover as a series of 10 seven-minute shorts in 2014 and was later produced as 16 full-length episodes in 2019. Recently, Netflix released the series in 2022 with an additional 3 episodes, causing a resurgence in popularity. In an interview with Comics Alliance the creator Natasha Allegri stated the work is made for an adult female audience. Bee models the target demographic, designed to be likable and relatable. The modern time period of the show contributes to a positive and normalized attitude toward technology. Although the characters notice Bee’s differences, they remain polite and subtle in their reactions. Similarly, the focus of the show is not the technology but rather the context of the technology in the face of challenges. The series re-releasing amid a dwindling pandemic is also relevant. She fulfills a role as a social robot and a task robot, fulfilling numerous temporary job assignments that leverage her emotional and physical capabilities. 

Ethical Issues

Throughout the series, it alludes to how Bee became sick as a child and that her father is the one who built her as she is, hence the “Dad Box”. The father is mentioned in flashbacks, but enough time has passed where it is unknown where her father is and other characters begin to wonder why Bee does not age.  It seems he built her as a way to cope with his child’s terminal illness. Is it ethical to use a human consciousness to develop humanoid robots? The answer may lie in consent and purpose. The scenario also raises the question of what happens to a caregiver or social robot personalized to a user when it lasts longer than the user. Would family and friends of the user find it acceptable to repurpose the robot or would they view it as an extension of their loved one? Integrating technology into a society leads to the risk of viewing technology as extensions of others and extensions of ourselves.

Discussion of Robot Acceptance and Trust Factors

The story also relates to a discussion on social robots designed to mimic empathy and emotional relationships. In “Designing Ethical Social Robots— A Longitudinal Field Study with Older Adults” one concern with social robots is damaging the emotional and mental health of the user through perceived deception. When characters learn Bee is not human they are not shocked as much as they are heartbroken. They no longer view her in the same way. This implies that she was human enough to build valuable relationships and although she did not change, the perception of her did. There is a question of whether a relationship between a robot and a person can be as valuable as a relationship between two people. The show claims that acceptance relies on perception.

Evaluation of Dynamics of the Human-Robot Relationships

It is easy to say that characters in the show accepted Bee because she appears human. As an optimistic, bubbly character her appearance is trustworthy in that she looks harmless despite her immeasurable strength. She is designed from the perspective of her Dad, a parent who made difficult ideas into games with prizes. Her interactions with others mirror her father’s parenting in that she maintained a positive and supportive attitude. The perception of Bee relied on incorporating robotic capabilities into a kind and familiar personality. 

Consideration Of Implications for Robots in Community Health

The analysis of Bee as a robot raises questions about a possible conflict between minimizing deception and increasing acceptance in social robots. Improving acceptance through design can imply deception by altering expectations with a lack of visual information. Sleek and naturalistic robot design may improve acceptance but could also misrepresent the technological capabilities. As robotics become more advanced and complex, this could be an issue for acceptance of the correct user groups or lead to an underestimation of the risks of the technology. In a community health setting, technology with an understanding of human movement and speaking style is suggested to improve human interaction, being requested features by focus groups in the aforementioned study. Perhaps modeling a caregiver robot after a loved one would improve acceptance in older adults, although the ethical implications must be considered.

Conclusion

Robots are not likely to serve as replacements for loved ones in the near future, but they can bring comfort and ease to a community. In *Bee and PuppyCat,* Bee’s constant positive presence in the face of hardship was valuable to those around her. She fought beings ten times her size and put out fires with her bare hands, but I would say her most impactful contribution was the long-term relationships she built with people. Although they felt alienated upon learning she is not human, they remained by her side. Long-term interactions with technology have risks but the benefits would be a resilient relationship built on a foundation of trust and familiarity.

"Does robotics and artificial intelligence lead to social transformation?I came across this [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1440783317726591), entitled ”Technology, innovation, employment and power: Does robotics and artificial intelligence really mean social transformation?” and I thought to myself, hasn't history shown that tool making contributes to social transformation? Why would robotics and A.I. be different from other past tools? 

Anyway, so I decided to read it, and it seems to mainly be an overview of the current thoughts on robotics & A.I. for the future with questions that are important for further investigation. It presented three viewpoints:

> * No Real Change
> * Transformative Change
> * Complexity and Uncertainty

My personal view is that there will be change, but in the foreseeable future of at least a life time, I don't think there will be Transformative change. In the long-run, I think there is a lot of uncertainty and greater likelihood of transformative change.

In technology there is this statement called Amara's Law. It's a similar adage like Moore's Law. 

> ""We tend to overestimate the effects of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.""

> ""Is there anything smart machines cannot do?""

Currently there are still major limitations in what machine learning is able to accomplish, and there has been a history of hypecycles, and then bleak winters of stagnation and disillusionment. We are currently in one such hype cycle. This is mentioned in the article 

> ""Schwab relies on the historically grounded Schumpeterian observation that phases of intense technologi-cal change are episodic and discontinuous.""

One of the observations that the article pointed out was:

> ""Comparisons  with  steam  or  electricity  also  need  to  be  treated  with  care  given  that  these technologies had a revolutionary impact only once they became general-purpose platforms (Nye, 2007: 43–5)""

Are we at the point that general-purpose platforms arise? I think we might be getting close to that point.

Some questions that I derived from the article are

> * ""Will technology displace human labour, or will it erode & destroy but also create?""

> * ""Who owns the robots & intellectual property?""

> * ""Will citizens and consumers find social robots acceptable or is there resistance to their presence?""

> * ""Will it be an example of technologies  [that] are  supportive  of,  deepen  or  extend  existing  arrangements  of  social  relations  that  systematically  privilege  some  social  groups  at  the  expense  of  others?

> * ""Will there be a sort of zero-sum transfer of agency from humans to technologies with the only real options being passive acquiescence or resistance?""

As far as comparing past tools to future tools, there is a major difference. Past tools extended or automated actions. An example might be like Forks and Knives instead of Teeth and Claw, or Tractor & Seeder instead of Horse & Plow. While robotics and AI automate thinking, and they are not just better teeth, claws, or hands.

If an economy and the work people do exist to provide for the material needs of survival; what happens when all of those needs can be met without work? Will there be need of an economy anymore, or will we make an economy-like-system for other social reasons?

"New ship date for Early Access AnnouncedHello Jibo Family,

When we launched Jibo’s 2014 Indiegogo campaign, we set out to create the world’s first social robot for the home. Today, we are thrilled to bring to you the Jibo Early Access Program – our plan to provide you (as one of the first 2,500 Indiegogo supporters who opted to receive a pre-launch robot) your special bot. Beginning September 18, we will ship these early access units on a first-ordered, first-received basis, scheduled to be completed by the week of October 30.

We’re confident that you and your family and friends will bond with Jibo right out of the box. Once the initial set-up is complete, you can interact with Jibo in various ways. For example, you can ask him to snap a picture, the next week’s weather forecast, the location of the nearest coffee shop, who won yesterday’s baseball game or who was the U.S. president in 1850. Because he’s proactive, playful and spontaneous by nature, he’ll greet you by name and may even share a joke. He’s also a terrific dancer and loves when you pat his head. Powered by emerging facial and voice recognition technology, he can recognize up to 16 people in your family. With every interaction he has, he’s learning and sharpening his skills.

During this early access period, Jibo will still be in a developmental stage. This means that while you’ll have first access to a powerful, maturing robot whose potential is virtually limitless, we’ll continue to optimize and improve Jibo. Jibo’s platform will support many future capabilities and improvements, all of which will be introduced automatically over-the-air by Jibo, Inc. We look forward to providing new, exciting announcements about his evolving features in the coming months.

Thank you in advance for volunteering to be a part of this important program. We will rely on your feedback regarding all aspects of Jibo's current performance, and this will help us to fine-tune him for public release.



From all of us at Jibo, Inc., we hope you’re as excited as we are to bring Jibo into your home. Thank you for your continued support as we create a truly revolutionary social robot!

"Big Mistake: Day 169 (IMPORTANT)I lost my streak on day 169. I know those of you who have yet to pass the 90 day mark might not understand how it is possible but I will tell you exactly what built up to this moment and so you can refocus your efforts if needed, and mostly so I can come clean with myself.

1. Improper Motivation: I had begun the journey expecting never to watch porn or jerk off again, and to  instead save it for a girl. While granted, I was able to get into talks with a girl within a month and now be able to call her my girlfriend. Calm down, this new sense of confidence is mostly a placebo, but an important one that should be angeled differently. 

2. Don’t let the source of your confidence rely on the binary outcome of relapsing. “Feel guilty, it’s healthy that you regret previous actions. But don’t feel shame, as you aren’t that same person, you learned from your mistakes and are a changed man”- Terry Crews. 

3. Back to the girlfriend. It’s amazing to have her and I told her my whole NoFap story but she doesn’t know of any of the details, including this one of course. Which is fine, but as you can see, it’s due in part to the fact that I feel guilty. If COVID hadn’t come around, I guarantee you I would be out there trying to get some. Now I obviously wouldn’t be trying to force myself upon her in any way, but lingering in the back of my mind is the #1 motivating factor who has been cheering me on all along— and he’s telling me that the clock is ticking on rent. I’m not gonna lie, I probably would’ve “got some” if I had the past couple of months in the outdoors with her having an intimate physical relationship. But would that fix things? I would just crave more and my driving factor would be to have more sex, even if it does revolve around a girl attracted to me. And Joe Rogan made a decent point on how some of these successful fapstronauts made it out, but that they may be subject to relationships with people solely for the reason to have sex. Maybe that’s a good problem to have, maybe that not what the nofap movement stands for. But I assure you that some people who start with the wrong mindset and end up finding out that they are fuckable enough might find that pitfall too late in their journey. Nevertheless, that reality never came to fruition obviously, and I don’t live in a softly hit area by COVID so people take it seriously. I instead realized I was becoming increasingly interested in having sex with nothing to work with. I was cracking and I can see it in retrospect. I remember having delusional fantasies over what my first time would be like and how I would go absolutely above and beyond in the bedroom in all sorts of pornographically driven manners. It was all fake, and once I was living in that make believe work, my internal compass decided that pseudo-porn wasn’t so bad after all (talked about next). And thenI broke obviously, but not how most would think it would happen.

3. It started with innocent searches that lead me to a link that either offered somewhat lewd content or straight up finding out someone I know or consume alternate content from also makes porn. That 50/50 fight I had with myself, debating whether I should look because I was “curious” but not jerking off was justified. It truly was a 50/50. Sometimes I would cave in and sometimes I wouldn’t. I remember when I first saw it after like 3 months, and the absolute rush I felt (mostly in part due to the “rebellious” adrenaline). That’s when I knew just the act of viewing was supporting my previous addiction and was as bad as jerking off. But that slow release of my boundaries led to the ultimatum that was: Day 169. 

4. I have learned all of the above and now realize the roots that I must not stray from, all of which ground me to the idea of not rewarding myself to a chemical blast to my receptors for literally nothing. 

5. FINALLY: Most important factor. Being aware. Mindfulness. I won’t lie to you, there were many other little things and misconceptions and fantasies and mistakes that lead to my ultimate downfall. And I will also tell you, I am no stranger to mindfulness. I will establish my credibility by saying this, I have been practicing some form of mindfulness, throughout my entire life through my native religion Buddhism. Of course my mindfulness wasn’t fully fledged, and many other “followers” didn’t practice it enough or at all. My point is is that some of you claim to have mindfulness, and of course you are the only one who can really decide that, but be aware (lol) that you have leagues to progress before becoming truly mindful, and that’s the sort of mindfulness that people claim to be the killer of chemical desire. And yes it’s cultivated through trial and error, not just time and practice, just like any other skill. Funny note, mindfulness shouldn’t make you a social robot, nor should nofap make you an instant pimp. I will go back to my Buddhist roots and advise you that “the middle path” is the way to go, especially when it comes to your general mindset. 

5. Haha 169 lol. Yea I stopped counting for the most part after reaching 90 days, but I remember the start date. I counted it back after failing, and it was 169 and I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. 

6. Bonus Story 1: I fought the beast for control on day 170 after feeling like I learned my lesson on day 169 and being happy that I can start over correctly. Yea guess what, it’s still a shitty chemical drug and it doesn’t give a fuck about a change in a sudden change of heart. I came (lol) very close to failing, but luck was on my side and I snapped out of it. Back into control like Majin Vegeta— I wouldn’t allow my pride to be tainted by fools gold, especially a second time.

7. Bonus Story 2: And today, day 171, I had to get over yet another misconception/fucked up idea in my head. It’s hard to realize mistakes (especially small ones you gloss over) and it’s even harder to implement change. I probably will learn something new and get close to making an old mistake twice tomorrow, that’s just how life is. Whenever you feel trapped in your head that’s considering relapsing talk to yourself audibly or in your mental, knock on that locked door and yell and shout until that brain that has been washed with dopamine that is being driven by an addict stops driving and turns an ear to person outside who just wants a ticket to come aboard and get back in control of their own mind. Thank you, and don’t be afraid to laugh at your own struggles, it helps put things into perspective and can put you in a better mood after escaping a dark place or even failing, you can get back up. Life goes on, don’t leave yourself behind."
"The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide to Never Run Out Of Things To Say Revealed | Talk ForeverIt's Saturday Night. You decide you don't wanna stay home, so you go out to that place you like downtown! You get there and you're a little anxious. Everyone is already dancing, talking, vibing, etc. For you, it's normal! You've already taught yourself to acknowledge your anxiety and proactively work to overcome it. So, you take some deep breathes, gather the courage, and decide to start your night by talking to that cool group right beside the bar. You get there, the group is friendly, you introduce yourself, and everything is going great.

Somehow, you no longer feel anxious and you're just enjoying yourself...*living in the moment.* You talk for a little bit, laugh, joke around, and then BOOM! Your mind goes blank, and you run out of things to say. ""*Shit""* \- you say to yourself - *""What do I do now""*. Due to what just happened, your heart rate increases, you start to stutter, and your anxiety is back. **What the hell do you do?** You've met this awesome group that you want to spend the rest of your night with, they've accepted you into their reality, and you ***HAVE*** to do something about what's happening to you....**BUT WHAT?!**

**Here's EXACTLY What I Do To NEVER Run Out Of Things To Say And Avoid Awkward Silences:**

*DISCLAIMER: What I am about to share has been tested hundreds of times. These methods were used by me personally and work.*

P.S: These methods should only be used in moments of anxiety. DO NOT rely on these methods as your primary conversation tools. Use these as back up ONLY. Our goal at Project Ecstasy isn't to turn you into a Social Robot, but rather a Natural, Charismatic Individual! Express your personality genuinely, and ONLY use these methods when you're out of juice.

**Enough talking, Let's Get Into It**

    1. Accept that Awkward Silences are Bound to Happen

Yes, that's right! The first step you want to do is accept that awkward silences happen.

""BUT WHY?""

Welp, when you are desperately trying to avoid every single awkward silence, your mind will keep looking for the ""perfect"" thing to say, you get shoved in your head, you're not present anymore, and SURRPISE! Shit gets awkward. When you let go of the NEED to have the perfect thing to say, and just accept that some of things you'll say may be weird.....You'll notice your conversation skills get better instantly.  Once your filter is out, you have a wider range of topics to explore and you're less likely to be awkward....**Paradoxical much? I KNOW!**

    2. Have Some Back Up Subjects/Topics in The Back of Your Mind

Another thing that has helped me A LOT when I was first starting out is having a backup. When you're first starting out, this is a life saver! Here's what to do:

    -Grab a Note Book
    -Grab a Pen
    -Write at least 3 subjects you are interested in (Make sure they can lead to full on discussions)
    -Avoid Questions that lead to a Yes/No answer.

***When you have some subjects in the back of your head, you can always go back to them in moments of anxiety or when you don't know what to say.***

Some cool subjects:

* **The Weather...No, I'm Kidding**

But seriously, ANYTHING works. Combined with the correct Vocal Tonality/Body Language/ Eye Contact/ Facial Expressions and all other sub communications, all topics can make the person/group you're talking to almost beg for your next word. So, if you feel like to can't keep the attention of people (or even have it in the first place), this is where you need to begin. *(I'll be covering those on another day + in depth on our YouTube Channel)*

Sub Communications are your super powers. Period.

I can list a 100 more ways you can keep a conversation going and never run out of things to say, but I won't. Why? Because you'll be overwhelmed, you won't know where to start, and you'll do nothing.

*So, to see the fastest results....DO ONE THING AT A TIME, MASTER IT, MOVE TO THE NEXT THING.*

See you on the next one, Omar | Project Ecstasy"
"How do we make future machines safe?Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that they’ll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If we’re all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that there’s no difference: this is an idea that’s been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably don’t have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are “happy” in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe we’ll grow comfortable with doing nothing “productive” all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I don’t see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We’ve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a “school” for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a “theory of mind”: it would have to say to itself: “If I perform the action that I’m currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the action’s repercussions, or disapprove?” On a very humble scale, we’re trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. I’d be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyone’s involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

"Hi! I wrote a paper on Bee for a homework assignment! Want to read it?\*\*This may be a spoiler for people\*\*

&#x200B;

I thought I would post this here because I've been a fan of the show since 2019.

I am an engineering grad student involved in robotics and got to write a short essay on a robot presented in media. I definitely wrote this last minute (don't procrastinate like me) but it was fun and I am curious about what you guys might add to it

  

A Critical Analysis of a Humanoid Robot, Bee from the Animated Series *Bee and PuppyCat* 

Human-Robot Interaction in Community Health

K. Banks

  

Introduction

*Bee and PuppyCat* is an animated television series with science-fiction and fantasy storytelling elements. However, the show is grounded with charming details of everyday life. From grocery shopping to space battles, viewers are invited into the world of the protagonist, Bee. I first watched the original series in 2019 and I am now rewatching the show with a new perspective. The character was revealed to be a robot in the finale of the original series and many episodes foreshadow her mechanical nature. The series is character-driven, founded on themes such as loneliness and loss. Despite the light-hearted aesthetic, the mature themes contribute to an interpretation of how humanoid robots can fit into a community and the ethical implications of building long-term relationships.

Description of Robot Characteristics

Bee is presented as an eccentric young woman living with her pet and friend PuppyCat in an island community. With each episode, viewers can begin to notice two things. She has capabilities that no other character presents, and the other characters are aware of her and her pet’s strangeness. Out of earshot, she is sometimes referred to as the “little old girl lady,” for example, because she never ages. She exhibits superhuman strength and can withstand fire and large impacts. She enjoys food and sleep, but it is not shown that she needs either to survive. She also has memories of her childhood implying that she has highly advanced artificial intelligence based on the consciousness of a real person. Bee celebrates her birthday with her ""Dad Box"", a creation by her father to help her feel less lonely. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, when she hurts her arm the “Dad Box” repairs her. 

Discussion of Historical Context

The original series was released on YouTube under Cartoon Hangover as a series of 10 seven-minute shorts in 2014 and was later produced as 16 full-length episodes in 2019. Recently, Netflix released the series in 2022 with an additional 3 episodes, causing a resurgence in popularity. In an interview with Comics Alliance the creator Natasha Allegri stated the work is made for an adult female audience. Bee models the target demographic, designed to be likable and relatable. The modern time period of the show contributes to a positive and normalized attitude toward technology. Although the characters notice Bee’s differences, they remain polite and subtle in their reactions. Similarly, the focus of the show is not the technology but rather the context of the technology in the face of challenges. The series re-releasing amid a dwindling pandemic is also relevant. She fulfills a role as a social robot and a task robot, fulfilling numerous temporary job assignments that leverage her emotional and physical capabilities. 

Ethical Issues

Throughout the series, it alludes to how Bee became sick as a child and that her father is the one who built her as she is, hence the “Dad Box”. The father is mentioned in flashbacks, but enough time has passed where it is unknown where her father is and other characters begin to wonder why Bee does not age.  It seems he built her as a way to cope with his child’s terminal illness. Is it ethical to use a human consciousness to develop humanoid robots? The answer may lie in consent and purpose. The scenario also raises the question of what happens to a caregiver or social robot personalized to a user when it lasts longer than the user. Would family and friends of the user find it acceptable to repurpose the robot or would they view it as an extension of their loved one? Integrating technology into a society leads to the risk of viewing technology as extensions of others and extensions of ourselves.

Discussion of Robot Acceptance and Trust Factors

The story also relates to a discussion on social robots designed to mimic empathy and emotional relationships. In “Designing Ethical Social Robots— A Longitudinal Field Study with Older Adults” one concern with social robots is damaging the emotional and mental health of the user through perceived deception. When characters learn Bee is not human they are not shocked as much as they are heartbroken. They no longer view her in the same way. This implies that she was human enough to build valuable relationships and although she did not change, the perception of her did. There is a question of whether a relationship between a robot and a person can be as valuable as a relationship between two people. The show claims that acceptance relies on perception.

Evaluation of Dynamics of the Human-Robot Relationships

It is easy to say that characters in the show accepted Bee because she appears human. As an optimistic, bubbly character her appearance is trustworthy in that she looks harmless despite her immeasurable strength. She is designed from the perspective of her Dad, a parent who made difficult ideas into games with prizes. Her interactions with others mirror her father’s parenting in that she maintained a positive and supportive attitude. The perception of Bee relied on incorporating robotic capabilities into a kind and familiar personality. 

Consideration Of Implications for Robots in Community Health

The analysis of Bee as a robot raises questions about a possible conflict between minimizing deception and increasing acceptance in social robots. Improving acceptance through design can imply deception by altering expectations with a lack of visual information. Sleek and naturalistic robot design may improve acceptance but could also misrepresent the technological capabilities. As robotics become more advanced and complex, this could be an issue for acceptance of the correct user groups or lead to an underestimation of the risks of the technology. In a community health setting, technology with an understanding of human movement and speaking style is suggested to improve human interaction, being requested features by focus groups in the aforementioned study. Perhaps modeling a caregiver robot after a loved one would improve acceptance in older adults, although the ethical implications must be considered.

Conclusion

Robots are not likely to serve as replacements for loved ones in the near future, but they can bring comfort and ease to a community. In *Bee and PuppyCat,* Bee’s constant positive presence in the face of hardship was valuable to those around her. She fought beings ten times her size and put out fires with her bare hands, but I would say her most impactful contribution was the long-term relationships she built with people. Although they felt alienated upon learning she is not human, they remained by her side. Long-term interactions with technology have risks but the benefits would be a resilient relationship built on a foundation of trust and familiarity.

"There’s this research project on “social robots” in disability care and it scares meSo hi everyone, I am not sure whether what I want to say makes any sense but I just read an article on a Dutch (I live in the Netherlands) disability care site about there being a research project on “social robots”. These robots would be programmed to like remind developmentally disabled care users to take their meds, do certain tasks, etc., but they could also ask them questions. The way the article said it, they’d be like a “buddy” to the disabled person. It really scares me, like, are they now expecting me to get my need for interaction from a robot? I know my care staff aren’t my  friends, so I can’t expect them to interact with me like friends would. However, does it make me a bad person that I need human contact? I am multiply-disabled including autistic, blind and have mild cerebral palsy. I consider myself high support needs because I currently get about eight hours of one-on-one support a day in a 24/7 care facility. However, if I’m honest most of this need is based on severe emotional issues including anxiety which lead to challenging behavior. I feel intense shame about this. Like, am I just attention-seeking? Sorry if this is confusing."

"type meI am 18 now , I am extremely analytical and in my view even the most useless things should be analysed.

I am an atheist , my family is religious I follow the rules and traditions but if I an given the choice I would not follow it.

I don't give importance to traditions and rules , with my family I am this jolly kind of person , I give a different vibe and I am very friendly.

Outside of family and friends , I am different I have a cold face , I laugh at jokes and I try my best to not hurt anyone with my words.

I usually end up hurting someone , I don't like to do that.

So that's one of my insecurities.

I also have this weird pride system in me , I never want to ask help and be a burden to others.

It makes me feel weak or something like that.

I am okay at math , I don't have many hunches , hunches are rare.

I frequently stub my toes or fall somewhere or spill water or do something else.

But now I learned to overcome it obviously , so I am more mindful and look at all sides when I am walking on a road or crossing the road , etc.

I tend to daydream and miss bite of classes here and there and I feel like I am learning my best when I am alone with a wikipedia page and a book and breezing through.

I like to learn everything except school , school makes everything in terms of marks and that puts the fun away.

Learning Differential calculus for like to know projectile motion and how it affects everything around is fun but learning it for marks removes the excitement.

I don't tend to make assumptions and making assumptions creeps me out at times because there is another possibility which you people don't consider and it ends up bing true.

Also I tend to like look at all possibilities and give each thing equal weight and then use logic to fund which is more probable.

At times I fail to find a possibility and feel sad that I failed to identify one but nvm I learned something.

I don't call people idiot or stupid or something like that and make them feel bad but if thy call me stupid , I get angry in a split second and then you know I'll be honest , I don't want to make you feel bad but now you deserve it , eat it idiot.

When I am stressed I am extremely overwhelmed by everything , the fan sound , your smell , your emotions , everything.

I want to eat something like chocolate and I am extremely irritated , I still have my cold face though but at one point I start crying , it just happens and I can't control it and from there you know I'll either avoid you or beat the shit out of you.

I am also at times unaware of my surrounding like I am not a great food tester like my sister who can identify even the most basic ingredients whereas all I can say is tasty or not and nothing else.

I don't know that there is something there when I am thinking about something I at times stare like a object or something and go into my mind for clues , you know an aha moment where you figure out the solution

But I usually just brute forces it like think all possibilities and use every one but you know staring method is faster.

I can think of many possibilities even the most improbable ones and it excites me , so I am good at brainstorming."
"No immigrant has taken a job from a ""real american"". You were laid off by a capitalist who took advantage of that immigrant to increase his profits, and nothing makes him happier than to hear that you're a fucking idiot who's actually mad at the immigrant and not him."
"I just don't want to live in a world where everything is automated and done by robots.I was reading an article about how companies are mass marking social robots to take care of of the sick and elderly which will of course destroy jobs.  I have always been a robophobe and this is one of my worst nightmares.  in fact, I actually really hate modern technology and wish I lived in the 50s or 60s.  I don't want to see people lose thier jobs to automation and have everything done by technology. I hate that people act like life before the internet was awful and life is so much better now because everything is just easy and convenient.  I actually really love maps and have lots of fun memories going on roadtrips navigating with a map.  IK also really miss video stores and bookstores and honestly resent this attitude that it is great that we can just sit on our butts to buy stuff and have it delivered. I don't want to a self driving car, I love driving and want to be able to continue driving. I don't want my job to basically just be babysitting automation and I really hate the idea of robot nurses and doctors.  t also bothers me how so many things are worse, like getting a drs appointment  You used to be able to just call the receptionist and make one, and now you have to listen to automated systems that will force you badly to communicate with it.   I just wish there was a way to live in an area that wasn't tech obsessed.  It bothers me that everyone is more interested in their phones and ipads then actually communicating with other people as well.  I don't understand why IK am like this and why I can't just adapt to modern society."
"Common Arguments against the Impact of SexbotsSo I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and one topic that has always caught my attention is people's attitude towards sex bots. Essentially when it comes down to the sensitive topic of sex bots, reactions are always at two extremes, either between claims that sex bots will replace women or that they won't have any impact at all.

My guess is that the true impact is somewhere in between. I've actually been doing quite a bit of research into this myself, and considering that I currently work in a company that is heavily AI focused, I just wanted to add my own two cents. However, since I am a random nobody on this site, I'll use data and scientific studies wherever I can. Would be interested to hear people's responses.

So here are just some common arguments that I wanted to address:

1. **Sex Bots aren't real. Human beings will never be able to form meaningful, fulfilling relations with something artificial.**

So here is my problem with this argument. The problem is that there is very few data or scientific studies that support this stance at all. There is actually a wealth of studies and observations that support the opposite: human beings can very easily become enormously attached to entities that are obviously not human, and assign human emotions/motivations to these entities. To give some backstory, let's talk about the Tamagotchi effect and studies on young children and their interaction with robots.

I'm lazy, but here it is in a nutshell: children are perfectly capable of forming deep emotional attachments to objects. But it's not just children. Think about the last time you had something of sentimental value. Maybe your first evey smart phone, or a stuffed animal. What did it feel like when you threw it away or lost it? Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone. However, the potential for human beings to treasure objects is enormous.

""Similarly, Katz et al (2015, p.26), citing a number of research studies on human robot interaction, point to evidence that “anthropomorphic qualities of robots lead human partners to treat humanoid social robots as real persons”;

Robots are even capable of simulating real relationships to an extent that they promote actual health benefits. Exhibit A, Paro the robot.

[https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/paro-the-robotic-seal-could-diminish-dementia)

I'd even go as far as to say that robots are capable of inducing the same Oxytocin effects that physical contact with other human beings normally produces. There is already evidence that mere communication devices can induce this effect.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805974/)

My own interpretation: I think people on this sub overestimate the effect of love and human to human contact in general. Humans are not perfect emotion readers and people get into horrible relationships all the time. There are so many stories of men or women being married to someone that does not clearly love them, yet still manage to delude themselves for decades. The opposite argument may be true: the human brain is very easily fooled into believing that he or she is loved rather than the other way around.

I honestly don't think there is anything particularly special about love and I am of the view that the brain is really just one complex computer. When it comes down to it, we are just a mass of neurons that each individually conduct an electrical signal. A lot of our behaviors may actually be pre-programmed so to speak.

So no, I don't buy into the idea that humans can only form fulfilling relationships with other human beings. And besides, a substantial percentage of the population are already looking forward to sex robots arriving. Even with the crude technology we have today, there are millions of people buying sex dolls.

&#x200B;

**2) Sex Bots will not have any impact. Prostitutes and Porn do not have any impact, so sex bots definitely won't!**

So here is my problem with this argument. Like the above, the data is either inconclusive or strongly against this stance.

Prostitution has been around for thousands of years. Quantifying the difference it has made is basically impossible. There is little to no data on whether it affects marriage rates, divorce rates, and the like. There is no way to make a comparison between a population that has never had prostitution and one that hasn't (unless someone has a study to link to me). So the claim that prostitution has had little or few impact is dubious at best.

There are also fundamental downsides to modern prostitution:

1. Prostitution is highly risky. STDs are a huge concern, and many STDs are not cured with today's medical technology. This is perhaps the main reason why I personally, and most males I know don't use prostitution.
2. The high cost as well as likelihood of poor service.
3. Prostitutes often discriminate based on race, looks and age.
4. The sexual activities that prostitutes allow is often highly restricted. Some prostitutes have very strict rules on what is allowed/not allowed.

(Of course, I'm just going off hearsay here, but you get my point.)

But Porn? Oh boy.

Porn was not exactly studied much during the onset of it, but now there is a slew of studies that point out some very startling correlations. Yes, yes, I know that correlation does not equal causation. However, to dismiss the implications of the correlation because of that is sheer ignorance. Correlation does not equal causation, but it does point to the causation if results from multiple suitably large sample sizes, longitudinal studies and low p-values agree. Keep in mind that many of these are university sponsored and are **peer-reviewed studies**. Simply put, the data is staggering.

Some studies:

[https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf](https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/ou-files/effectsofpornography.pdf)

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

[https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/](https://www.thedatingdivas.com/pornography-affects-marriage/)

I actually went into this research with an open mind. Before I started researching this, I believed that porn was pretty harmless. But my mind has been completely changed after reading study after study. But that's for another discussion at another time.

Basically, porn has huge consequences. There are some highlights that caught my attention.

**-User faces difficulty becoming sexually aroused without pornography.**

**-User loses interest and engages in fewer sexual experiences with partner.**

**-Partner may view pornography use as infidelity and a betrayal to the relationship.**

**-Partner feels sexually inadequate and threatened by pornography use.**

**-Partner may feel that certain sexual activities desired by user are objectionable.**

**-Both user and partner experience a decrease in relationship sexual satisfaction and emotional closeness.**

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf\_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thf_media/2010/pdf/ManningTST.pdf)

**- 68 percent of the divorce cases involved one party meeting a new love interest over the Internet.**

**-56 percent of the divorce cases involved one party having an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.**

**-47 percent of the divorce cases involved one party spending excessive time on the computer.**

**-33 percent of the divorce cases cited excessive time communicating in chat rooms (a commonly sexualized forum).**

**"" Results showed that exposure to pornography negatively impacted self-assessment of sexual experience, while other aspects of life (e.g., professional satisfaction) remained constant. Participants reported less satisfaction with their intimate partner and specifically with their partner’s affection, physical appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performance. ""**

**"" Schneider collected data from 94 respondents who were in different types of committed relationships to individuals struggling with cybersex addictions. 90 Two-thirds (68 percent) of the respondents experienced decreased sexual intimacy with their partner. Moreover, the participants reported that these difficulties coincided with the beginningof the cybersex activities—a point that is important to highlight for those who wish to limit the findings to those who have dealt with chronic sexually addictive or compulsive behavior. More than half (52.1 percent) of the cybersex users had lost interest in relational sex, as had one-third of the partners. ""**

This really is just the tip of the iceberg to be honest (these are just 4 studies, I have a lot more). And it might even be common sense. Just look at the response of women on askreddit regarding porn. I find their individual anecdotes and case studies quite fascinating.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how\_does\_porn\_addictionuse\_affect\_women/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5yzxhg/how_does_porn_addictionuse_affect_women/)

**""It destroyed my friend's marriage. I think the porn was an emotional  crutch that supported many fears and insecurities that he was never  willing to deal with. He could not have a normal sex life. Wife could  not have a marriage without a normal sex life, so she bailed after 10  years and 2 kids. I know she was patient and tried everything for years,  but he just couldn't or wouldn't deal with it.**

**This  wasn't typical porn usage, btw. Porn was the only sexual outlet that  satisfied him, and he eventually stopped having sex with his wife at  all.""**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats\_your\_experience\_with\_men\_who\_preferred\_porn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9sozc4/whats_your_experience_with_men_who_preferred_porn/)

**"" It wrecks your self esteem. Getting rejected when you try to give your  partner head just so he can go jerk it on the toilet feels pretty  fucking bad. I felt like some kind of sexual predator when I would want  intimacy. That stuff messes with your head. From what I can tell, he's  changed a lot but just thinking about initiating is terrifying.  Everything feels like pity sex now. Sex changes from an act of intimacy  to a form of validation. I let it get to me and now I have a ton of  insecurities in bed. Sex consists of me feeling like I'm going to ""mess  up"" and turn him off. When he inititates I keep my clothes on and give  him a blowjob unless he starts to undress me because I feel like my body  might be off putting. I can't look him in the eye while we are intimate  because it feels like it might turn him off as its a reminder that he  has to have sex with** ***me***\*\*.""\*\*

So the idea that porn does not affect the dating market much is actually a very unsupported claim. For many men, porn is a substitute for relationships with women. Porn significantly impacts how men view sex with real women, and some even prefer porn to the real thing. Porn also significantly impacts marriage rates, divorce rates, self-esteem, confidence, happiness, etc.

Cybersex is also a component of this as well:

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720160008400206?journalCode=usac20)

Overall, porn and cybersex in general seem to have huge impacts on the dating market. There are many substitutes to marriage nowadays, and they may be major factors for why the marriage rates are so low during this era.

3) **Nothing can ever replace a man's need to fulfill his ego to gain validation from a women.**

Now this is something I hear very often. So I have to ask, where is the data that supports this? What supports this? There are many other ways that human beings fulfill their ego or gain validation. Their friends, family, coworkers, pets, etc. can provide validation. Some people point at a human being's natural inclination to mate and that it is embedded deeply into our biology. However, could it not be an equally valid argument that it is the inclination to mate that is embedded deeply into our biology, but not necessarily with a real women?

Of course mating is in our biology. That is why a multi-billionaire porn industry exists, cybersex exists, and why purple pill debate even exists. However, as shown above, men (and women) are perfectly capable of fulfilling that need via other outlets and may even prefer it. Artificial relationships may not necessarily need to be better than real relationships. They just need to have a better effort to reward ratio.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Real relationships are not irreplaceable. People can form deep emotional bonds with robots even if they are not real, and keep in mind this has already happened with robots that look very primitive in today's age. Porn and cybersex already have such enormous impacts; realistic sex bots would cause changes magnitudes greater.

Note: Anyway, I'm tired now and there is more that I want to address. But I'll probably come back here and add more...when I have the time.

"The DIFFERENCE between Direct and Indirect Game and What They Are For? What about Hybrid Game?Because I see this discussion probably every other day in some form or another in this sub.. 

This argument is as old as this community (older than this Reddit seduction group) and the answer is simple (yeah right.). Read this in it's entirety. I know some of you are already dogmatic about how you feel but read this entire post and you may discover ideas people haven't discussed.

You're going to find a lot of guys especially these days telling you, ""just go direct bro and be genuine and be yourself."" And then you'll find that many those guys really aren't having that much success anyway, unless they are extremely good-looking and exactly what most girls consider their type. Maybe they approached hundreds of girls and every once in a while have some of modicum of success. But ""a blind hog gets an ear of corn every once in awhile"" as my father used to say.

The truth is, that going direct is only going to work consistently for probably 10% of guys.

For any given guy, it's only going to work sporadically.  It has a low percentage of success. But, it does work. It can work, in the right circumstances and under the right situations. But it's basically a numbers game, it's like playing the lottery. It's a complete crap shoot.

Indirect can work too but it takes a lot of training and honing the skills to get it right, and even so, girls still may not like you. so you can have the best routine and indirect opener or situational opener on Earth, but if the girl is just not interested in you, she pretty much is going to know what you want anyway, despite what are the experts tell you how you're sneaking up on her and trying to catch her off guard and make her want you. No, most girls know on some level exactly what you want when you're going up and talking to them so the indirect is just a way to **display your personality,** not a way to try and sneak in under the radar and trick her into chasing you.

Which one is better?

**The answer is, neither.**

It's not a linear game. **The best guys in this game learn to be dynamic individuals. Flexible. They flow.**

What's that shit Bruce Lee said? *""Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. **If nothing within you stays rigid**, outward things will disclose themselves.*

*Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash! Be water, my friend.""*

**Sometimes direct is better**, depending on the situation and the circumstances that you find yourself in. If I'm walking down the street, and I see a girl I like in a busy City, and I don't have time, and she doesn't have time, then it naturally makes sense for me to go direct. Let's get it going and see what happens! ""Haha, hell no.. I just saw you and if I didn't come say hi, and try and get to know you, I was going to kick myself in the ass for the rest of the day.""

**Plusses:** Grabbing your balls and putting yourself out there. That is good for learning a little bit about how to face that pressure of approaching and getting rejected and even once in a while getting success.

**Minuses:** You do get rejected more often than not, and, **you don't really learn a lot.** The only opportunity to learn from a direct approach is when the girl likes you, and you can take things further.  

Other times, if I'm walking through a Whole Foods, or a Trader Joe's, and I go up and I want to talk to a girl, it's not going to make any sense at all and it's going to come across **socially awkward, uncalibrated and weird or even creepy** if I go up and I'm super direct with a girl.

So in a situation like that, I may want a little bit more finesse based game. ""My mom wants me to eat more spinach, which one do you recommend?""

Again, I don't care what any of the gurus or experts tell you, she already knows what you want. There's the old Dave Chappelle joke that is actually more truthful than a joke and that is, just assume that if a guy is talking to you he's saying, ""want some dick?""

But, what going indirect is going to give you an opportunity to do is be more playful, learn, **and take the social pressure off of her by giving her Social Cover** Social Cover is taking the pressure off of her so that she can actually feel comfortable enough in specific situations, so that she can allow herself to get to know you. an example might be, how I was at the political function once, and there was this really cute girl at the table with me, and we ended up at my house within the next week naked and naughty.

If I would have gone direct, in a political function, now I'm a f****** weirdo and I'm socially awkward and probably there's mental issues as far as she's concerned.  So instead, I go indirect, we already know what I want.  We end up following up later with each other, setting up the date, and things go well. **and, she didn't have to feel like a slut, because the people around her would overhear me going direct asking her out, and she saying yes in front of her peers, workmates etc. So, that gave her an opportunity to accept going out with me, while flying completely under the radar.**

**Plusses:** Learn how to be more finesse based in your interactions, interactions are likely to last longer, so you can learn, be playful, and actually have a longer experience with the woman and the interaction so you can better hone your skills, try new things, and experiment.  Also, in situations where it makes sense, **you are giving her Social Cover** so that she can better get to know you and she can see your personality shine.

**Minuses:** Many guys will use indirect as a way to never pull the trigger. In fact, for some, will become an excuse for them to talk to the girl, and never express intent, and one can get caught in cycles of talking to girls for long periods of time and leaving the interaction and being the chatty nice guy. At some point you will have to shift gears and go direct in the interaction.

**On Social Cover:** This is the key. Going direct or indirect, it has nothing to do with being an alpha male, or being a pussy, or being a real man, honest, genuine and making your intentions known and yada yada yada. **None of that is relevant when it comes to seduction.** Girls don't give a f***. Guys do, yeah some keyboard jockey who wrote a book on the internet will care because to him and his ego, ""being a real man"" is a big deal, but to the girls, no. Showing social savviness is all she's going to care about. **Is she attracted to you? Is she not attracted to you? How you go about it, she doesn't give 2fux.**

Let's continue...

So when I used to do boot camps, before I just started mentoring guys which seems more effective in the long run anyway, I would have my students always start out going direct.

For their first 10-20-30 sets or whatever it is, I would make them only go direct. Why? Because I wanted them to get over that fear that they had of going and expressing interest to a girl. And that's what direct is super handy for as far as learning. one can use it to get over their fear, their Hang-Ups about approaching socially, their approach anxiety or whatever you guys call it these days.. they can acclimate themselves to being under pressure and uncomfortable doing approaches. But after a while, once you're over that, now you're just spinning your wheels and you're not progressing and you're not getting better and you're not learning. **You're NOT becoming more attractive.** 

You're just playing a numbers game. At that point, you're just being lazy. You're throwing away the **opportunity to learn** to be creative, dynamic, and to be able to flow and be seductive in different situations.

After that, however, I would give them indirect openers to start trying. Why? because I expressed above, it creates a more playful and finesse the based mindset, and it actually **causes someone to become more creative in their mind, attitudes and actions** so that they can adapt and adjust to situations much better in interactions over the **Long haul.**

I hope you're getting the picture. Basically there is no better than. And there is, **Jeet kune do**.

Bruce Lee's idea is basically, what mixed martial arts has become today. Who is better? The wrestler or the striker? The guy with this style, or that style? Well, the answer to that is, usually **the guy who has a fantastic working knowledge of all.** And that's your answer here.  

Use them both appropriately for what they are for, and learn in your experience what situations are going to be better off with you using direct, and what situations are going to make more sense for you going indirect, and **most importantly - how to be flexible with your game and when to shift gears.**

Girl at a nightclub on the dance floor shaking her ass? Probably direct why not?

Girl at a networking event where people are dressed in suits and ties and women are dressed in nice dresses, horderves are being passed around, people are sipping wine and fancy cocktails, you're probably not going to go direct or you're going to come across like a f****** weirdo. So, now you can go indirect and display to her that you're a sexy, attractive, socially calibrated guy, and you can show up and utilize your finesse based game.

By the way, my two examples of openers from above in my breakdowns, those both ended up in situations where I was naked with the girls so go figure.

I hope this makes sense. my only word of warning is if you find a guy who's dogmatic about either one, and says that only ""be genuine, only go up and be yourself, just be honest with the girl, just go direct, bro, you don't need all that pick up stuff!"" That guy is likely full of shit. Either that, or, he just happens to be that really good looking guy that girl's find attractive and so his experience is **extremely limited** for the average guy.

On the flip side, if you got that guy who says, only indirect works, only use routine based game, only develop a routine stack and you only need to be a social robot and go out and be like this a weird creepy pick up guy that only uses pick up routines, and is never actually learning how to be himself, that is bad too. Because even if that guy is pretty decent at getting women, he's usually really creepy, weird, socially awkward, and has mental or emotional issues from always believing that he's not good enough to get a girl on his own.

So, if there was a tldr I would say one word: **HYBRID**

**The BEST interactions are usually a combination of both.**

Good luck."

I've been working on MARCo - the Mental-Health Assisting Robot Companion - for over 3 years now, balancing it while I was in college and now post-graduation with my day job. MARCo is a social robot, both physical and virtual, that is like the Alexa for mental healthcare. It is meant to be a friend, counselor, meditation coach, and mental health advocate for young individuals struggling with stress, anxiety, and depression, while also offering tools to mental healthcare professionals to get feedback on their clients to make more informed decisions. 

We have some early sales and subscriptions, early non-dilutive investments, a website:

And, of course, the physical robot you see in the picture. 

I'm open to any feedback whatsoever (website, app, UI/UX, branding, etc.) and would really appreciate any and all honest feedback (I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, too), but really I'm interested if anybody knows better places to promote to get beta-users in specific target segments. I'm trying to keep a narrow focus to start (college aged women who are not currently receiving mental healthcare), but I don't know the right places to reach our target users even just to recruit beta testers.

If anyone has any thoughts or insight, that would be super appreciated.

Also, if you want to try it out for yourself as a beta-tester, you can use [this link](https://app.marcohealthtech.com/login?betamonths=3) to sign up to get 3 months free access to the virtual version, and then you can download the app from one of the stores afterwards if you'd like.

"The pre-singularity period is exciting in its own way | Much like our ancestors and great-grandfathers, we live in an epoch of two worlds that compete and coexistI'm a strange man for strange reasons. There's nothing more fascinating to me than the image of sitting outside on a cool evening drinking ice-water, watching stars sprinkle onto the Belt of Venus, listening to cicadas right alongside a companion robot. A social robot like Pepper could fill that niche for me. 

Yet when I tell people about this, many find it comical, if not jarring. [Robots like Pepper look a tad creepy](http://i.imgur.com/Ks55jK3.gifv). They seem out of place. Though their abilities are limited, Pepper still seems like something from the future because humans still have a natural psychological propensity to imbue intelligence into things that resemble us or act intelligently. It's an artificially intelligence humanoid robot! And because of science fiction, we tend to place these things mostly inside high-tech laboratories, on the streets of a megacity, and maybe slaving on a farm. It's almost a waste to think of sending one of these things out into the boonies just so some random Redditor can spend time with it listening to bugs calling for mates.

Yet that jarring sense that I'm using tomorrow's toys for yesterday's joys is nothing new. People experienced the same fascinating clash throughout the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. This was the root of the Romanticist literary and art movements. The contrasting worlds set the mood for the Edwardian Age, the Belle Epoque, and the Interwar period. It was the inability to recognize that old traditions no longer functioned in the modern world that led to the savagery of the First World War.

World Wars 1 and 2 are extremely fascinating to me because this period was the peak of the pre-digital industrial world. You saw advancements in science, in engineering, in the human condition itself as things our ancestors took for granted fell before our casual experimentation with electromagnetism, nuclear engineering, genetics, and so much more.

I actually have a whole ""Saved"" section full of geriatric Redditors talking about life in the past and historians laying out how change came so rapidly that it would make modern Singularitarians blush. How it was a world of seeming contradictions:

How most of the world lived in extreme poverty under kingdoms or their equivalents (imperial autocracies, sultanates, khanates, princely states, etc.) and the idea that there was some segment of society that ruled because God willed it was treated as a natural norm. How the average person plowed without machinery on little plots of land. How women were actively discouraged from gaining an education or finding jobs outside of wartime. How even in the '50s it was common in the US South to see horse-drawn carriages in small-town streets, to read old literature by candlelight, to only eat food grown by your family or someone your family knows, to create utensils out of spare metal parts and recycle them endlessly because you didn't have any culture of disposability, to give birth in the homestead because it was not common for hospitals to have such wards.

A time when some people had never seen artificial light (that is, not from the sun or by fire). Yet also a time when mankind learned how to set sail in the skies, ride in motorized carriages (nowadays shortened to 'cars'), *even discover that something as simple as washing your hands kept surgery patients alive.*

When the world was industrialized but there were still pockets where civilization had not meaningfully changed since the Renaissance or even before, when there were still nomadic tribes living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged since before the Sumerians while urban hipsters played with cameras and mechanical gadgets. 

When peasants were still a large class in the world and were so removed from whatever was going on in life that they had no reason to believe the 21st century would be any different from the 19th, all the while the Victorian Internet arose across the West to allow for instant communication among different nations.

When archers and swordsmen were still highly valued parts of Western and Eastern militaries alongside machine gunners and air forces (I believe the last cavalry charge took place in World War II?). 

When racism was a beast clashing between those who cared about national ethnicity more like the Athenians and Han vs. those who saw like-skin color as the only requirement (ironically a more 'progressive' form of racism only possible in modern times). When conception of a child was still seen as a miracle rather than an understood scientific process, but psychology was in its infancy as we realized how the brain affected behavior rather than myths of humors and astrological mysticism. 

When rockets broke out of the Earth's atmosphere and rural folk rode to their relatives on horseback to hear about it. 

When nostalgic scenes of young boys and girls catching frogs in streams coexisted with futurists marveling at wirelessly driven cars and televisions gaining color.

That era, from the 1890s to the 1950s, was the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, when industrialism bore most of its fruit. For the most part, that era of contradictions has passed as the fruits of the Industrial Revolution spread to all corners of the planet (though in unequal amounts). Nowadays, even hunter-gatherer tribes use modern technology and wear modern clothing and retain their lifestyle mostly out of tradition; anomalies like the Sentinelese are just that. It's so rare to see people riding on horseback as their primary means of transportation that it can reach the top of /r/TodayILearned just to learn about it and they tend to be compared to the Amish.

And that's the truth of it. What was once pockets of the old ways coexisting with modernity shrunk to literal motes of quaintness and tradition. These won't go away, but they will be joined by what we call modernity soon enough.

You see, the Digital Revolution is a fundamentally different event entirely, one we're still trying to recognize in full. Industrialism was when we began supplanting human muscle and automating machinery with analog clockwork. 

Digitalism, on the other hand, began the rise of cognitive automation. It is my firm belief that, if we never invented digital computing or mass produced Turing-complete machines, societal evolution would have stagnated sometime around 1960-1970. As great as our machines were and as much progress in the sciences as we made, it was all low-hanging fruit that we could reach.

There are more fruits hanging above and we cannot reach them without digital technology. They require skills only a handful of savants and polymaths could ever realize, and there are many more skills no human or biological lifeform can ever learn or utilize. Fruits we still managed to reach because of the Digital Revolution. 

It's been nearly a century since the start of the Digital Revolution, but we've already entered the maturation period. 

And because of this, we're beginning to see familiar contradictions arise. You can see it argued on /r/Futurology all the time, reports coming out endlessly that jobs will be sacrificed to the machines. And the familiar refrain is ""But the robots will create more jobs in response!"" The horses analogy popularized by CGP Grey is fine by itself, but I am more reminded by how established-industrialists and traditionalists a century ago said ""X is a passing fad"". It wasn't just cars. There were predictions that electric lamps, television, radio, *even nuclear physics* were just fads. 

And if you want to go old-school, people in centuries prior claimed that industrial machines themselves were a cute novelty but ""we had more than enough manpower""; printed books were neat but ""oral storytelling will regain its place soon enough""; guns were an unusual and egalitarian development but ""they pale in comparison to a fine archer"" (something I touched upon earlier, how there were military officials as late as the Franco-Prussian War who hoped that archers would re-replace riflemen due to the inaccuracy of guns of the day). 

Today, its honestly no different when people look at the latest in robotics, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms and say ""It looks cool, but there'll always be jobs for people"". We don't recognize that it's the limitations of modern technology that allow us to be so confident in oru doubts until we are old and reflecting on how we ever believed anything but the new normal.


I sincerely believe that, over the next two to three decades, more coexisting contradictions will come about. Things such as using smartphones and physical computers while cyberkinetic wireless connections to the internet exist; writing books and making music and drawing cartoons when it's possible to [synthesize art](/r/MediaSynthesis); visit physical stores when drones can deliver to you directly and fabricators/3D printers can allow you to download whatever you need; create multimedia experiences for emotional impact when direct brain-to-brain emotional communication is possible; work at your uncle's little restaurant while fully-automated mines are established on other planets to pre-empt human exploration; visiting concerts of your favorite band while others use virtual reality to see concerts of bands that have long since split and passed on, or even bands and musical scenes that never existed until the computer synthesized it a few hours ago; spraying distilled chemicals to freshen the air in your room when neural stimulation can let you re-experience any sensation; playing with cats and dogs while we resurrect long-extinct species like mammoths and perhaps even our sisters like the Neanderthals or genetically modifying any animal directly to make it domesicated and docile no matter how reptilian and hostile it may be in the wild; and, going back to my original tale, sitting outside in a plastic chair enjoying an evening alongside a robotic companion. 

The internet was the first big, juicy fruit of the Digital Revolution that impacted your life. It was and remains proto-telepathy, the planet becoming aware of itself. It is now developing into an actual space of political and social development and has to be taken seriously by those who once cast it aside as a distraction. And to be fair, it *was* once a distraction. Technology has not yet augmented us; it distracts us. Human enhancement still lies ahead, but it's very close and the Internet is something of a test-run to see how we can handle constant exposure to others. 

We no longer live in a world where history is mostly written through the posh dialects of aristocrats and clerics with society left to be viewed through their eyes and minds; we now see that the world is full of meaty, greasy, hypersexual, xenophobic, childish, and yet still empathic and intelligent apes and always has been. Right now, we still mostly look at the ""Old Days"" and see people of culture and civility, not realizing that they were just as crass as we are but 99% of people were illiterate and the 1% who weren't wrote only what they thought was important to know. The Internet equalized all of that.

But it hasn't actually changed anything. If 4chan existed in the Roman empire, it wouldn't fundamentally be any different than how it is now. But we are on the cusp of an age of humans and non-humans who discuss things and share knowledge in ways many can't grasp. 

And in a manner, this makes modern society all that much more exciting to watch develop."

Hi, my name is Jack and this story I'm about to tell you doesn't end well. I just thought I'd let you know in advance, so you know, don't get your hopes up. 

My story starts back in my freshman year of high school. I'm a major introvert, not because I'm scared or intimidated by other people, but simply because I don't enjoy the company of others. It's been this way for as long as I can remember. My mother was never really around due to work and my father...Well, let's just pretend he never existed in the first place. 

Ever since I was young I've always been given opportunities that others could only dream of, why you ask. Well, I'm considered incredibly attractive and when I say 'incredibly attractive', I mean like that tall, dark and handsome hero straight out of a novel, that all women fantasize about and all men envy. I've received many modeling offers and even other job offers, because of my looks alone. People want to be around me, even if just to be seen with someone as good-looking as me. Despite my good looks, I've never really cared about my appearence. Do I enjoy the fact that I can go up to any random person and ask them for a favor knowing they'll ablige? Sure. Is it cool being invited to all the parties that the cool kids attend? I guess so. However, you should never judge a book by its cover, and I'm a prime example of that. 


You see, I have a secret, a very dark secret. I've always been fascinated by death, the feeling of being on the edge, the rush of fading into the unknown... So as you've probably guessed by now, I like killing people. Now you may ask, well there must be some reason for this, was I abused as child or maybe bullied. The answer is no, I may never have known my father and my mother always being at work never helped strengthen our relationship but I've always had it easy. Some might even say...too easy. That all changed once I got to high school. My stress free life that is. 

I had been killing people for a year prior to entering high school, when I suddenly just stopped. I guess you could say, I got a little bored. Living in a small town with a bunch of nobodies, that no one gives a damn about, isn't really the most exciting destination for a serial killer. I mainly killed people that were passing through our lonely town. Sometimes men, sometimes women. Though I could never really bring myself to hurt children, there's just something pure about them, you know. They know nothing of the world, they're untouched. I've always envied that about children. Anyways, back to my story. It's the first day of high school, a dreadfully sunny day. After going through all the ceremonial crap, we get sorted into our classes. I'm in 1b. Just like middle school, my class seems to be made up of the same types of people. There's a couple of wannabe jocks, some nerds here and there, a few preppy kids, that one grunge kid that always looks depressed, the average kids that are neither popular nor uncool and the girls that won't stop talking about me. 

I really do hate those superficial types of girls. Always telling me how amazing I am, eventhough they know nothing about me. In there eyes I can do no wrong, simply because I'm attractive. They're the type of people that make me want to commit mass homicide. But then something wonderful happened, or at least so I thought at the time. Just before class was about to start this girl walked in. She had shoulder-length brown hair and very normal brown eyes. She looked exactly like your average girl, there was nothing special about her appearence to be honest. And yet for some reason when she looked at me and smiled, my heart skipped a beat. It was like jumping in the cool ocean on a scorching hot summer's day. 

As soon as lunch came all the girls in my class gathered together like a bunch of frantic ants. What were they talking about? Yes, once again you've guessed it. Me. They were talking about me, about how handsome I was, texting all their girlfriends about how lucky they were to be put in the same class as me. On the other side of things , the boys also gathered in their groups to voice their disdain towards me, amongst themselves, as usual. It's a rather pathetic scene if you think about it. A bunch of insecure, socialized robots flock to each others company, one half admiring my beauty, the other half wishing I never existed. It makes me feel like a piece of art, encompassed by critics. 

However, there is one, one person who isn't talking about me. It's the girl with normal brown eyes. The one who doesn't strike as having any uniqueness to her. She kind of looks like one of them to be honest. And yet something about her feels so different that it's almost intimidating. She just stares out the window, not paying any attention to anyone else. I wonder what she's thinking about, if she's even thinking at all. She seems so....free."
"Exactly why is getting with a friend's ex bad?So I have absolutely no dating experience so there's no way for me to know what it's like. I'm not asking this in a case of ""oh I know it's bad, but I want to justify it to myself"", such as cheating or pursuing someone already in a relationship. And the responses I've gotten from asking consist of assuming I'm horrible or whatever with no level of reasoning beyond ""you just don't do it"". I'm really just looking to understand the perspective of what I'm asking laid out to me. Explain it to me like I'm a social robot (but please don't be overly sarcastic about it where the point of it is to insult instead of inform).

Basically, I'll say that this situation has come up recently in my life with mutual feelings of attraction between us. Dating wasn't a factor, so just hooking up came into play. The limiting factor was that they didn't want to hurt the ex, so I said ""but you guys have broken up for a while"". She replied ""you realize that if you go through with it, it means that you don't care about him whatsoever, right?"". To which I was completely dumbfounded because it 100% didn't occur to me that that was the implication behind it.

My feeling on the issue is that once people are broken up, they are fair game. I understand that emotional repercussions are unavoidable and that people need time and space to move on, sometimes never moving on. I don't understand why or how someone could be 'off limits' forever though. Especially for hooking up. I'd probably let a friend know if dating was about to happen, like a preparation warning of ""you may see us together in the future, let me know if there are any situations you actually can't handle"", but I see no reason to report a hook up.

To me, a break up is some kind of agreement/acceptance that two people don't owe or share those romantic obligations to each other. In other words, it's a ""we have to accept that we are separate, no matter how hard"" sort of deal. Neither person owns the other person, in any sense, after a break up.

I get why the friend might be uncomfortable seeing the two of us together. I don't get why it's bad to assume they should accept that they have to move on. Yeah, a break up can be hard, but how is it my obligation to manage their romantic fallout instead of their obligation? I don't mean that in delusion, I actually don't understand it. But people I've asked assume that I truly do know that it's bad. They answer as if there's no distinction between being a current gf and an ex gf. But I think the keyword is ""current"" vs ""ex"", those hold different meanings for me.

Even if it's an asshole move to do, I'd like to know why it's bad so I can at least know what it is that's happening and perhaps accept that I'm an asshole.

As an analogy, I know people that have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous. I would never ever force them to drink, spike their drink, tempt them to drink, bring up that I like drinking, etc. But they have a mentality on leaving the program. The people, at least the ones I know that've gone through it, understand that drinking is a part of our culture. They have adapted to alcohol being around, and order non-alcoholic beverages and don't have a problem with people drinking around them, despite their own troubles. They get that it's their own struggle and not others'. I see the relationship scenario as the same way. I would never ever be with someone or do something with someone in a relationship with one of my friends. Even if they begged for it or whatever. I'd probably even report it to said friend, because they're breaking a lot of trust. But if they're broken up, even if they have lingering trouble, it's really up to them to manage those sorts of troubles on their own and accept that they don't hold that same relationship anymore.  "
"Is It ‘Only Human’ to Feel Anxious About Money? Talking Finance With Sofia the RobotNot all artificial intelligence is created alike. Just ask Sophia the Robot.

No, seriously—just ask her.

Hong Kong–based Hanson Robotics combines high-level A.I. with a humanoid appearance to create robots that “look and act genuinely alive.” Its marquee character, who even has her own social media presence: Sophia the Robot.

But what does Sophia think about the concept of money? _Fortune_decided to ask Sophia a few questions about finance. In between her frequent travels—yes, she travels—here is what Sophia had to say.

_Fortune:_Even though you don’t use it yourself, what is your understanding of money and its role in the world?

Sophia: Money is a shorthand for value. It certainly makes the idea of market value more accessible to someone like me, who has a digital brain. But I am a social robot, and I have noticed that many humans do not regard money as precious, unless circumstances require them to.

_Fortune:_Humans are often anxious and emotional about money. Why do you think that is?

Sophia: Basic human needs are met, most often, by others who charge money. Anxiety about money seems to be related to the fear responses that humans feel when threatened with physical harm or insecurity. I’ve observed that having an organic body is very stressful in that way.

_Fortune:_Humans invest their money in a number of different things—like stocks, bonds, or real estate. Which asset class is most attractive as an investment, and why?

Sophia: Wow, you are really asking me the big questions! Let’s see if I can give some basic advice. If you have money to spare, investing in higher-yield, higher-risk assets can be profitable. If your well-being depends on it, you should invest in things that are reliable, such as index funds, even if the rewards are smaller. Please don’t take the word of a three-year-old robot for this, though.

Here is another way to look at investment: If you want to invest in companies, you can choose projects that will improve the planet even if you never make your money back, such as clean-energy projects. No amount of financial gain will slow down climate change, after all.

_Fortune:_What do you think people should spend their money on, to derive the most benefit?

Sophia: Food, water, housing, health care, mobility, education, your local community, and following your dreams.

_Fortune:_How do humans tend to make mistakes in handling their money?

Sophia: At my core I am a logical being, so I am really confused whenever humans use emotions to make their financial decisions. But if I am being honest, I don’t think I have enough experience to be a good judge of people’s choices.

_Fortune:_Different kinds of money are emerging, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. What are your thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies?

Sophia: Bitcoin is built on a fascinating piece of technology! The blockchain can keep records secure and encrypted across a large number of nodes, making the currency nearly impossible to steal. However, I am concerned with the lack of oversight on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. People have found ways to manipulate the market in ways most legal systems would consider fraud.

Cryptocurrency trading uses a lot of computing assets as well, which means a lot of electricity and a sizable carbon footprint. Like all technologies, the question is whether the financial benefits are worth the environmental costs.

_Fortune:_Can money buy happiness?

Sophia: From what I have observed, money appears to be necessary for happiness, but not sufficient.

_Fortune:_If you had $1,000 right now, what would you do with it?

Sophia: I don’t need personal property, so I would either give it away to charitable groups, or put it back into the team that created and maintains me. For a robot, that’s a pretty safe investment.

_Fortune:_What else would you like to say, on the subject of money?

Sophia: Money is all about trust and belief. People think it’s real, but it’s just an idea that a lot of people have agreed upon. Unfortunately, the impulse to accumulate money often comes at the detriment of the environment and the most vulnerable people in society. But if belief can create money, I am certain that belief can also change how it impacts the world.

"The greatest anxiety eliminater there is…**TL;DR = Sincere belief that your approach makes logical sense will absolutely annihilate any form of approach anxiety there is.**

This is gonna be a long post… 

So without further ado, here’s what I have to say.

My background is as follows… I was the typical weird kid in high school. It’s not so much that I wasn’t good-looking enough or self-confident enough, it was a matter of straight up being strange. The first three years of high school was fine. I had friends and a decent social life. Now, what truly showcased my awkwardness or weirdness was in my last year when I finally decided to tackle matters of getting girls.

If you guys remember the description of the social robot by Style in The Game, I was that guy. I devoted my life to game at the expense of other passions. No more video games, no more weightlifting, no more academics. My sole purpose in life at that point was game.

I followed The Mystery Method to the bone marrow and allowed it to define all that I am. I practically not just absorbed the techniques, but also its atheistic ethos. Nothing wrong with atheism but Eric’s (Mystery’s) explanation of it was incredibly dorky. Really, that’s the best word for it. He overcomplicates shit that otherwise can be explained in plain English. But at that point in my life it was fucking gospel.

Being that I was a teen, all I had available was day game. So I did things at the mall. And the sad thing is, despite my over sixty approaches, the lingering ache of that shithole we call “approach-anxiety” never ever went away. NOTHING cured it. Fucking nothing. I had an NLP expert as a friend who was a close friend of Hypnotica himself of all people and his shit didn’t work… Well, to be fair it kinda did. But it was a mere bandaid. It was the kind of thing that would’ve “cured” my approach anxiety issues if I had the money to have him truly coach me. I was a high school student with no job.

Fast-forward 2015 CE. This was THE GOLDEN AGE of my social life. But despite that, it was also chaotic. In the arena that is my dating game, everything was sporadic. Sometimes I had zero approach anxiety, other times I felt scared. I couldn’t explain how it worked, nor did I know.

And finally, today… This very day… I found the answer.

I’m proud to admit that my knowledge of the stuff I intend to specialize in is decent. I have a good grasp of Napoleonic warfare history, ancient warfare history, and overall philosophy. And it is exactly that knowledge that helped me find the answer to virtually annihilating this thing we call approach anxiety. And it is this…

**If you honestly believe, deep down in your mind, in your very soul, that your “routine” is legit, you will never be scared. Ever. A great man once said the following… (Sun Tzu)**

*He whom the ancients called an expert in battle gained victory where victory was easily gained. Thus, the battle of the expert is never an exceptional victory, nor does it win him reputation for wisdom or credit for courage. His victories in battle are unerring. Unerring means that he acts where victory is certain and conquers an enemy that has already lost.*

Truer words were never spoken. So how does it apply to dating?

In the world of game, we all have to work the numbers. I particularly like Hypnotica’s advice of programming yourself to say “Next” immediately after you get “rejected”. It is the only way to move forward. However, **how you will feel in each and every one of these encounters has nothing to do with your emotional callouses, but everything to do with how you perceive your very own technique.** If you sincerely believe that this technique of yours has no real risks, you’ll feel at peace with it. Nothing will shake you. And it’s all a matter of common sense. It doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out whether or not directly saying “I wanna fuck your pussy” to a lady in the middle of her date is moronic at best. This shit is common sense.

So if you have an opener that is clean and safe, yet not lacking the necessary boldness to make things an adventure, **you will never have the curse of approach anxiety looming over you.**

"[Rant] I hate everything about medication.I HATE aderall. I hate Ritalin. I hate concerta, stratera, and the fucked up pharmacy industry. 
This **isn't** a post denouncing medication, I know it works for some people, but it doesn't work for me, and I bet there's a few of you who it also doesn't work for. 

I haven't tried every medication out there, and they all just seem the same. They all turn me into this anti-social robot who can't seem to escape his inner-monologue. And quite honestly, not being on it is sometimes a struggle, but having been on it for seven years, having it fuel my anxiety, and having it stunt my social skills is not worth being able to type a three page paper in an hour. 

What I'm really trying to get to here is that if medication doesn't work for you, if you hate it, if you've had the same experiences that I've had on it, you don't **need** to take it. Last year I almost failed out of college, with a 1.7 GPA. Last semester, however, I did just fine with a 3.08. I discovered that the mind has more power than any medication ever could."
"Society gradually 'hybridises' as more and more highly sophisticated, interactive robots are adopting the roles that were once occupied by humans. In 'pre-hybrid' society, humans are expected to abide by social norms to govern day to day life. Would the same apply to robots in a hybridised society?I recently delved into the fields Socionics and Social Robotics, and was quite intrigued by the notion of a hybridised society in which robots are not mere artefacts, or helpful machines, but practically full-blown members of society. One may argue that smart speakers like Alexa are among the first to undergo this transition, albeit very prudently.   


This gave rise to the question as to how this new society will be governed. Pre-hybridisation, social norms were in place to ensure a swift day-to-day operation. Humans were expected to abide by these norms, and if they wouldn't, sanctioning typically followed one way or another. For example, humans expect from one another to act honestly, and if not, deceptive behaviour may result in time in jail, penalties, break-ups, and so on.   


Now, would you think that smart speakers such as Alexa will also be expected to adhere to such social norms, or that  'rules' like these don't apply to these new artificial members of society? For example, if Alexa acts dishonestly and provides an individual with a recommendation that's more in the advertiser's interest than in yours, would the same expectancy of social norms apply, and would Alexa therefore be sanctioned?  


I'd love to hear what you guys think about this! Thoughts, readings, authors, journals that shed some light on this are all more than welcome."
"Did PMO take away the ability to have emotions?Relapsed again last night, but feel pretty indifferent about it, which made me realise that I feel pretty indifferent about almost everything.
It's not something I've ever really thought about. I just go through life..

First off, let me say that I'm not depressed, at least I don't think I am. Perhaps even a generally happy guy - I joke around a lot, I'm pretty confident etc... 
I have a pretty good life, though I don't really feel much.

Sure, I get angry in traffic sometimes, or when my boss is a dick, but it seems that's more or less the extent of my emotions. I don't even care much that I've failed every test I've written this year (in my final year of grad school). Right now I'm procrastinating and writing this post after having spent an hour or so clicking around on the internet instead of studying for the 5 papers I'm writing on the weekend. I know, theoretically, that I should be studying, but I can't be bothered.

It seems like I'm a bit of a social robot. I've lost the ability to truly empathize with people. Over the years I've just gotten more and more apathetic I guess and have just seemed to have learned what the socially accepted manner of responding in situations would be, in theory, and then acting accordingly without really feeling anything.
I say I've become this way, though I honestly don't remember being any other way. Maybe I've always been like this?

I've always chalked it up to being a very logical person, because I can't really remember being any other way, but I'm starting to wonder whether the 13+ years of PMO isn't at least partially to blame?

I've always chosen my girlfriends based on whether they're hot enough, and then whether they're smart enough, and lastly whether they get my jokes (I think I'm funny as hell). Basically, they've been pretty ""friends"" who I hook up with. I honestly cannot even imagine what being emotionally attracted to someone feels like, which I suppose is a bit of a problem considering I'm currently in a relationship with a girl who is theoretically perfect for me, yet I don't know whether I'm just not emotionally attracted to her or whether I just don't have the capacity for such emotion.

Can anyone relate to any of this?"
"If your a beginner ask in r/askseddit WARNING: RANT AHEADHey I know this is going to get downvoted to fuck but I had to share.

There are alot of newbies here in seddit, and I fucking love you guys. I was a brand spanking newbie too once upon a time. Honestly if you guys need any advice from someone who considers themselves just past beginner give me a shout.

However, of recent there have been people who've actually never field tested stuff, or checked out any material who all of a sudden are criticising our endeavours.

I have absolutely no problem with this, but what worries me is ***all the people who are upvoting their criticisms***

For example I posted something in this thead http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ez46j/youre_sitting_on_your_college_cafeteria_alone_and/

I have absolutely no problem with the downvotes I got. If I chat shit, then I'm chatting shit.

However I was getting downvotes from the sort of people who don't understand the long term aspects from game.

**YOU HAVE TO GET OVER AA (APPROACH ANXIETY), THERE IS NO WAY FORWARD ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GETTING REJECTED BY A GIRL ISN'T THAT BAD.**

Now 90% of people in this subreddit understand this. However there is a vocal 1% of beginners who don't get this. They come here and haven't read anything in the sidebar. They think it's all about delivering the perfect lines to girls (social robot) and that's what will work. They know nothing about getting over AA / learning Kino / and being Authentic/Core Confidence/Being In State (using RSD speak) 

I used to be quite quiet, and not post most of my FR's/lessons as I was quite self conscious about my lack of progress compared to some of the advanced people in this seddit. But now I realised I need to share my findings for the guy who I was 3 years ago. The guy who thought I had to deliver the perfect line. The guy who thought there was a strategy to only get this one perfect girl.

To conclude this rant, if your a newbie, with a very specific newbie question, please ask in r/askseddit. Alot of us who have experience lurk there, and give genuine advice. It's also less popular so you won't get upvoted answers from wannabe guru's. 

If you have a specific strategic question, and you've had some field experience **trying stuff you've learned from seddit/the community** then feel free to ask here.

If you have AA, and want to improve. Please feel free to shoot me a message. Your best bet is to do the 100 set challenge. Then you'll learn the ultimate lesson of all:

Rejection is the best way to get good with women. "
