"Industrial robotics is a robot that is used in manufacturing Industrial robotics is a robot that is used in manufacturing. Often, they are colloquially called robotic arms. Industrial robots are programmed and automated to do very specific tasks. Usually, they are capable of movement of three or more axes. The most common functions that the industrial robots perform are assembly and handling, cutting and welding, packaging and palletizing, painting, and dispensing. Rising automation trends and industry 4.0 standards are resulting in the requirement of such robotic arms.
