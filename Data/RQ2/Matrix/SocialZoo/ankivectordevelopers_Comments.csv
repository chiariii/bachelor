"[""The latest .NET version is 7.0.  I'm not sure why so many Linux users install 3.0 -- 7.0 is fully supported on Linux.  The vector SDK will work on any version.\n\nNeither Python or .NET have a GUI by default.  For .NET, you can use something like https://avaloniaui.net/ to create a GUI application.  You could also use ASP.NET to spin up a web application to be your GUI.\n\nThe Vector SDK doesn't handle any of the UI at all.  It's merely a programming interface to Vector.  For example, it sends the camera feed as a series of images -- presenting that to the user is your responsibility.\n\nThe SDK connections work in parallel with Vector's server connection.  It won't hurt anything and vector returns to normal when you disconnect."", 'Got it, thanks. I\'ll jump on the forum and start playing step by step.\n\nI think the reason 3.0 is widely installed is this line on the .net sdk github:\n\n```\nTo get started on Mac and Linux, you can download .NET Core 3.0.\n```\n\nAnyways, I\'m now up and running with python after a few tweaks. \n\nUnfortunately I can\'t connect vector yet due to a certificate error. \n\nI used him for a while with the official app, then factory reset him to do the 1.8 downgrade required for wire-pod. His BLE ID ""name"" changed, and now he won\'t connect in the app to generate a new certificate.\n\nI\'ve emailed DDL.\n\nI have asked for help with that on the [main vector sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnkiVector/comments/ztry8w/certificate_name_wrong_after_reset/)']"
"[""I have no idea, I'd imagine anything more than 2GBs would be good enough tbh, most modern pc's should be fine, more ram is better assuming you want to run python scripts on it, [BUT IF YOU DO PLAN ON DOING PYTHON SDK SCRIPTS, please authenticate your vector on the official companion app on Android or iOS first with your DDL account](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnkiVector/comments/1108hen/for_those_who_are_less_techsavvy_who_want_to_run/), this is important because if you install the wire-pod firmware onto your Vector, you won't be able to go back to DDL's without a complete user data wipe, meaning all your vector's saved data that you've accumulated would be gone, some people might not mind this, but I did ;w;"", 'Dude you’re helping me so much! Thank you. I couldn’t find anything other than like black hat hacking back then which yeah lol', ""I see, I delved into this rabbit-hole about a week ago so.. xD  \nFigured I could help those in need, since the discord has been closed off to the public. There's loads of info on r/AnkiVector for this stuff too, not just this sub, I also delved on google and github a lot. I live in a third world country and have health issues so a subscription service isn't really an option for me sadly""]"
"[""Oh okay so the sdk is just it's set coding right? I'm assuming the difference is the official the regular coding and the one you use allows different features within the coding, so with that being said. Does the apk u use have any unique features u recommend or would I have to use that as a tool to create unique coding?""]"
"['Yes. Eventually you’re gonna have to pay a membership. This will allow you’re vector to have voice commands and receive future updates. I believe rn your stuck on version 1.6 right? Theres a monthly membership and yearly. I suggest the yearly because eventually the monthly will cost you more than the yearly in the long run. I think you’ll have to start paying for a membership by October? Not really sure. Hope this helped.', ""Yes, as Cozmo is a complete different robot and doesn't have the cloud element. But he really relies on the app as he uses the phones computing power.\nVector however has a better CPU and is autonomous. Hope this helps""]"
"[""Shit same, forgot the days of sideloading iPhone apps. Yeah that makes sense, he's fairly bare bones in comparison. Vector runs some custom embedded linux as base for it's firmware I believe. This SDK actually looks great, ima put it off for a little bit (mainly cause it's 1am) but I'll definitely check this out. Looks like you've put a lot of effort into this repo. I much prefer c# over python anyday and would love to use it on vector. I'll whip out VS Code within a few days and check this out further!""]"
"['I found a way though Alexa, but am prospecting other methods and have been in touch with the new owner of the company over at DDL (Digital Dream Labs). I\'ve also setup 2 servers for Speech & Visual recognition in case I\'ll need to direct the data to my own servers for image manipulation (plus I\'m in control of these). I also found a method to reveal Vector\'s underlying code, but you have to throw errors to make the debugger spit out his ""proprietary code,"" and then it\'s only the sections where you throw an exception that become visible. Been looking at the linux kernel for Vector also to see if I can inject a \'helper\' to dispatch messages & signals to Vector\'s sensors. One way or another I\'ll get it! Will post more details as I go.']"
