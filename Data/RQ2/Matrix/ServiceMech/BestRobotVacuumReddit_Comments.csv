"["" I suggest Coredy  Robot Vacuum Cleaner, Fully Upgraded, Boundary Strip Supported, 360°  Smart Sensor Protection, 1400pa Max Suction, Super Quiet, Self-Charge  Robotic Vacuum, Cleans Pet Fur, Hard Floor to Carpet I  bought this item as I like to constantly keep my floor clean since I  have pets around the house. It's actually a really good product. It  works! I have it to turn on everyday at 5am so when I start my day the  floor is already clean. I have not had any issues with it. I check the  vacuum container everyday and see how much dust and pet hair it collects  every day. It's amazing. I am very happy with this purchase and have  already recommended it to friends who have purchased and are very  pleased with it as well.  \nThe dry mop device also works good. It might  leave some water strikes on the floor but it keeps it clean. I usually  use it once a week or whenever needed. It's a good device to have unless  you don't mind mopping. Either way, both devices (the dry mop and the  vacuum) definitely saves you time and work and best of all it helps me  keep my house clean.  \nOther notes...  although you will hear it  working you can say that it's relatively quiet, but I don't mind any low  noise since I usually have it set to work while I'm asleep and don't  hear a thing."", 'Best Samsung Electronics R7040 Robot Vacuum Wi-Fi Connectivity, Ideal for Carpets, Hard Floors, and Pet Hair with 3510Pa Strong Performance, Works with Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant, Neutral Gray\n\n The power Bot worked well for about two weeks, but then something happened and it died.

You can schedule time and it runs at the schedule time. If it got stuck somewhere you will get a notification in your app. Sensor needs improvement, it will bump into many hurdles.

It was able to pick up our dog and cat fur along with dirt and debris with ease.  \nThe L900 works with my Alexa and from my phone through their app. It's a step up from older iVacuums.  \nIt is also fairly quiet while it's cleaning.

But the demand for smarter navigation, as opposed to random navigation patterns, has spawned a new category of robots: Laser Navigated robot vacuums. These robots map the space around them, detecting walls and obstacles and marking them on the map. Moreover, they know where they are relative to the map, and thus navigation is done easily and efficiently. That contributes in following a specific and quite precise path while vacuuming. A mapping able robot is a big deal, considering the complex and advanced algorithms required for mapping patterns. If you think that scanning and mapping the surroundings is an easy tasks and that the robot vacuums don’t do a good job, check out some literature for SLAM which might make you reconsider regarding the technical challenges of such an implementation.', '\n\n\nFor allergy and dust mites I recommend Rowenta RR6971WH Smart Force Essential Aqua robot vacuum cleaner.

In most homes, they keep the floors tidy with barely any effort—pet hair and crumbs disappear before you even notice a mess. After testing dozens of bots, including pricey machines that can also mop, empty themselves, or try (in vain) to steer around pet waste, we think most people should look first at the simple, tried-and-true iRobot Roomba 600 series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur pick\n\niRobot Roomba 614\n\niRobot Roomba 614\n\nReliable, repairable, and good on rugs\n\nThis tried-and-true robot vacuum is much more durable and repairable than similar bots from other brands and is better at cleaning rugs too. It’s a nimble navigator that rarely gets stuck, though it works best when it only has to clean three or four rooms at a time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$225 $200 from Amazon\n\nYou save $25 (11%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$200 from Walmart\n\n$200 from Best Buy\n\niRobot Roomba 675\n\nReliable, repairable, and connected\n\nThis is essentially the same bot as the Roomba 614—plus Wi-Fi connectivity that enables remote control from a smartphone app, scheduling, and integration with some popular smart-home voice assistants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$250 $180 from Amazon\n\nin stock December 12\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$250 $180 from Target\n\nYou save $70 (28%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$180 from Best Buy\n\n$240 from Walmart\n\nLike any great robot vacuum, Roomba 600 series bots are intrepid navigators that find debris you’d never catch on your own, without getting stuck on typical household clutter too often. They’re better at cleaning rugs than most other affordable bots, and they’re actually sturdy, repairable appliances that you’ll own for years—not just some gimmicky gadget. The semi-random navigation system is the norm among low-cost robots but works perfectly well in areas that are smaller than 1,000 square feet. The bumbling randomness gets on some people’s nerves, though, and it’s not consistently effective in larger spaces (our upgrade picks are better if you want predictable performance, especially in bigger homes). The 600 series robots are also a little bit louder and rougher on furniture than some comparably affordable bots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a handful of 600 series variants, but the only important difference is whether they can connect to Wi-Fi (for remote control and setting schedules via smartphone app). Paying $250 or less for any of them is a fair deal; $200 or less is an excellent price. You could also consider the Roomba e5, which adds tangle-free brushes and extra suction to the same sturdy 600 series base. (It’s also sold as the e6 at some retailers.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBudget pick\n\nEufy RoboVac 11S\n\nQuiet, nimble, and affordable\n\nThis affordable robot vacuum is quieter and fits under more furniture than any other model we’ve tested. While it works best in small spaces, it rarely gets stuck and does a good job on bare floors and short-pile rugs. It’s not as durable as a Roomba.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$220 $150 from Amazon\n\nYou save $70 (32%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo other robot vacuum blends into the background like the Eufy RoboVac 11S (or other models built on the same body). This basic, affordable bot sounds more like a desk fan than a vacuum—even if you’re home while it works, you’ll barely notice it running. It’s thinner than most bots, which lets it glide under more furniture, picking up plenty of hidden debris. The big downside is that the 11S (and others like it) don’t seem to be built to last for more than a couple of years on average, and we’ve heard about plenty of unrepairable breakdowns that happen even sooner. And while the 11S will get your floors much cleaner than if you didn’t vacuum at all, this bot just isn’t built to dig up much debris from rugs, especially softer, thicker types. Like the Roomba 600 series (and most other affordable bots), the 11S is a semi-random navigator and works best in small spaces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEufy sells at least a dozen variants of this bot, each of which has a slightly different set of additional features such as Wi-Fi, extra suction, or do-not-cross strips. There are loads of functionally identical knockoffs, too, from brands like Goovi, Coredy, and others. Seriously, we bought a couple, and they’re essentially the same robots, all the way down to the beeps and boops they make (though we’re not sure whether the other brands’ customer service will be as responsive as Eufy’s). We’d buy these bots only when they cost less than $200—we regularly see them for $150, and sometimes even cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpgrade pick\n\nRoborock S4 Max\n\nSupersmart bot, great price\n\nThis robot vacuum can quickly and gracefully navigate large spaces, and it offers a robust and flexible system for cleaning specific rooms or zones (while ignoring others) via smartphone app.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$430\\* from Amazon\n\n\\*At the time of publishing, the price was $0.', "" BISSELL SpinWave Wet and Dry Robot Vacuum, WiFi Connected with Structured Navigation, 28599 o far I've only used it to vacuum (no mopping yet) and I love it. I'm in a small, fairly cluttered apartment and it gets into every corner that it can physically fit in. I have all hardwood floors and a small part where it drops down into tile. The robot has no issues with the slight bump. Even with the cat chasing it around the apt and bumping it, it is still able to find it's home. From the video reviews I found, they all had perfect little rooms or hallways, so I was glad it actually can handle complex layouts, even though it doesn't have mapping abilities. It's also quiet. If the neighbors downstairs can hear it, I would be surprised. Can't wait to try the mopping setting! My only complaint (and not worth dropping it a star) is that its home placemat doesn't stay on the floor very well. Easy to fix (maybe better rubber feet?) so I'm surprised it's an issue.

I had a lot of doubts because I have rugs and I didn't know if I was really going to be able to leave the robot cleaning on its own afterwards. In the end I decided on this one because it seemed to me that it was the one with the best price for the functionalities it has. I'm very happy. The pot goes alone around the house, I leave it when I go to the office and I return when it has already returned to its base and everything is quite clean. Sometimes it does not reach under the fat legs of my table, although the truth is that I struggle myself with the broom. The app is fine, although I had a hard time finding it in the App Store. In the end, for what I was looking for, which was to sweep, vacuum and scrub, it goes perfect. The only but is that perhaps I would put longer brushes so that it reaches more hidden places. For now, delighted."", 'The Roborock S4 Max is a brilliant navigator that can thoroughly clean most homes, large or small, giving you maximum control over where, when, and how it operates. It learns your home’s layout in one cleaning session, after which you can send it to clean specific rooms (and ignore others), while also avoiding any no-go zones you’ve set up (perhaps near bowls of pet food or delicate furniture). It’s all done through an interactive map in a smartphone app, without actually touching the bot, placing physical barriers, or hoping the random cleaning algorithm does what you want it to do. The laser-based navigation system is also great at evading obstacles, which helps the S4 Max cover a lot of floor space quickly and thoroughly, following a predictable path (without random bonking or skipping big patches). The big downside is that Roborock bots aren’t nearly as sturdy as Roombas, and they may have more trouble on certain rugs than competing models. If you think all of these controls sound too complicated, or don’t intend to connect your robot vacuum to Wi-Fi, this isn’t the robot for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe S4 Max is brand new and will usually sell for $430, which is a fair price. But we have it on good authority that it’ll occasionally drop to $320. We wouldn’t pay much extra for bots from the higher-end Roborock S5 or S6 lines (like the S6 Pure) if you can avoid it—their extra features are mediocre at best. Plus, as of late 2020, plenty of robots have nearly the same features as the S4 Max yet sometimes cost significantly less.

The dustbin is located under the middle section and there is not latch that will wear out like my old Neato. After charging the vac, I set it down and watched it go. Unlike my old Neato that followed a semi-smart path, this one goes by random movement. The bumper is pretty sensitive so it doesn't ram into something super hard before turning. The vacuum noise level is also a lot lower than my old Neato. While that makes me think it doesn't have as high suction power as my old Neato, it still picked up a decent amount when it was done.

I had bought this vacuum for hardwood floors as that's what I had at the house I lived at previously. The house I'm in now has hardwood and carpet and the vacuum (which we named succbot) has earned her place in this home as well.

I compared a bunch of different brands and models and kept coming back to this one. it arrived today so I set it up, let it fully charge and then let it loose\\~! I have all hardwood floors in my living room and kitchen (which are connected by large double door openings). I dust mopped and wet mopped last Saturday and have not swept since because I wanted to see how it would handle a weeks worth of normal daily living. It did AMAZING\\~!!! I can't believe HOW much dust it found after only 1 week of wet mopping\\~!! I am SOO excited to have this gadget\\~!! It is going to make a HUGE difference in our air quality and it is going to help me keep the house tidy\\~! I'll post updates if any issues arise, but for now I'm SO glad I picked this one...I didn't crash into anything with any kind of force, It was CRAZY QUIET.... and found it's home without any trouble....

They diagnosed that something was stuck on the roller and sure enough a clear elastic band had been vacuumed up and was causing the problem. I removed it and voila...back to normal\\~!!

"['Best robot vacuum for long hair reddit 2021.\n\n* iRobot Roomba E5 \n* ILIFE V3s Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner\n* eufy by Anker BoostIQ RoboVac 30\n* Roborock S4 Robot Vacuum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur Recommendation is ***Roborock S4 Robot Vacuum***.Multi Floor support was theain reason for buying the S5 max. This allows me to create and save Maps for upto 4 floors. Additionally, the Robot allows you to keep the dock anywhere on the floor once theap is created. It automatically figures out where it is, completes the cleaning and returns to the dock. It also allows for different levels of water and suction power for every room. It can figure out when it finds a carpet and increases suction power for more efficient cleaning. It allows for No go zones where the Robot will not go at all, Invisible lines which will temporarily block an area, No mop zones which if setup will be vacuumed but no mopped (like carpet) and zones which could be setup for cleaning. Very intuitive app as well. The buying experience from Digicartz was also excellent. I got instant responses and help and was informed as soon as the product was available. I would highly recommend the product and Digicartz.']"

I got it thinking it would be useful as a daily sweeper for our new home\'s downstairs, which is laminate flooring, including a combined kitchen/great room, long hallway, and 1/2 bathroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter about a month of use, I honestly wish I\'d gotten a robot vac for light everyday cleaning years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis vacuum does an utterly phenomenal job at edge cleaning, which is where 90% of our daily dust/mess comes from (wife makes a mess cooking and little crumbs wind up against the edges of the kitchen floor) and the performance has been good, with low noise and generally good edge detection. Just make sure there are no small loose wires or anything, because it will get stuck. It does do a great job at getting dust in the nooks and crannies along edges of walls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe vacuum has not been super spectacular at returning home, however. about 1 in 5 days I\'ll come back to find it dead in the middle of the floor. Not a big deal, just toss it back on the charger, but maybe our docking spot just isn\'t the best for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt can also get confused sometimes, getting stuck between the legs of our bird cage and just spinning in circles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts ""random"" pattern cleaning works for single rooms, but if you have an L shaped room, a room with furniture in the middle, etc. it just won\'t clean effectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it really struggles on our medium pile carpet upstairs. I tried it more as a joke, but it has to run on turbo and even then, just doesn\'t seem to have the horsepower to drive around very well on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly though, I got it for about $90 on a flash sale and as a taster for robot vacuums in general, it has sold me on the concept. These things are the best way for a lazy cleaner to keep a tidy home, just tap a button before you go to bed and your little robot butler sweeps your home. But if I had to make a recommendation, it wouldn\'t be for this - or any vacuum that doesn\'t have room mapping. We will absolutely be spending a little more money in a few months on a couple more powerful room mapping vacs - there are many on amazon in the $150 range with good reviews, so that\'s where I\'d point anyone interested in a robot vac']"
