"I just made a bet with a friend that in 2 years I would arrive for our annual dinner party in a robotaxi. We live 30 miles form New York City. Will I have to pay up, or will we have It by then?"
"General discussion on the robo taxi network.I'm currently a fan of Tesla and plan on buying a vehicle at some point in the future. I think it will be a good investment since I plan on joining the robo taxi network. When I start to go into the details of how all of this will work, my brain starts to melt.  So I'm hoping more people start to join this subreddit so we can share our thoughts.

Some questions I have to maybe get us started:

1) What happens if a rider makes a mess in your vehicle?  Leaves trash, spills a drink, or pukes? I'm guessing the rear facing camera would help identify problems like this, but will Tesla charge the rider for cleaning or damage?

2) What happens if the robo taxi gets involved in an accident? Maybe driving through a grocery store parking lot after a drop off and a car backs into it? Will the car know to wait for a police officer and report before leaving? Will the police officer have a way to let the car know it's free to go?

3) Will passengers be able to sit in the driver seat and operate anything? Disengage the autopilot, honk the horn, turn off the lights? I'm hoping it will go into taxi mode and just allow music or games to be played.

4) Will the driver be able to adjust where the vehicle parks?  I might start with the Cybertruck and think it would be great for people needing a truck to pick large items up from stores (building material, furniture...). I can see scenarios where you need to move to a certain spot to be loaded. 

I would love to hear some of your thoughts and questions."
