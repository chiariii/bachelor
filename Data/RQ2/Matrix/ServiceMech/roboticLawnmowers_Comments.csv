For sure the edges will have to be prepared to accommodate the robot, just like the other robots I mentioned, which is why a robot with a perimeter wire often turns out to be the easiest to install. And, if the edges are properly prepared, not having a camera lens to clean and the ability to mow at night are significant pluses.\n\nI suspect many of these new entrants to fade away over time.

You will definitely want to avoid a brand that uses a proximity type of signal, i.e. that is only transmitted near the wire. Those systems, the robot has no way of detecting inside from outside.

"["">Does all this sound correct?\n\nMore or less. But I was testing, trying to determine mower state from the power draw and seeing what happens if I toggled off the plug.  It starts charging around 1:30PM, then goes mowing around 3 before the battery was full, returns  around 6 (my DIY battery has 5+ hours capacity but it will only mow for 2:30 due to software). From 9 to 12 the plug was turned off, which causes my robot to drive off the pad and turn off.

Clearly yours turns off the boundary signal while its charging, so you are saving 5-6W pretty much constantly except when its mowing. Thats \\~44 KWH per year. but I also dont really believe the 2W idle figure, that would be a really low consumption for the mower to be on and keeping its battery topped off, especially if it has wifi or some other connectivity.

"['Im going to elaborate a little using Ambrogio\'s line of small mowers, as those are the ones I have experience with. The L15 deluxe is advertised as up to 600m2 the L20 deluxe for 700m2. The difference between both? The L15 is green while the L20 is white. And the L20 doesnt come in a box with perimeter wire. There is no other difference, I kid you not.\n\nThen there is the L20 Elite, rated for 1000m2. It adds a cellular data connection (which is just for convenience, its not gonna change a thing about its capacity) and a GPS, which can make a difference if you have a complex garden with multiple areas. The GPS will allow it to mow more efficiently then, but if your lawn is one large patch, its gonna mow exactly as much as the others. Then there is elite s+ which is rated for 1300m2, and it has twice the battery capacity. Which can help, especially if you dont mow at night, but its the same charger, so it will charge pretty much twice as long. Net gain is limited.\n\nNow, I have the L15, but an older model with 15cm blade instead 18cm for the new one. And yet it was also rated for 600m2.  My backyard is 2-300m2. It could not cope this spring when my grass was growing like crazy. I had to run it from dawn till dusk and I would still see patches of unmowed grass. If it rained a few days, it would take 3-4 days of dawn till dusk mowing to mostly catch up and more often than not, I would just take my old mower.\n\nI have upgraded my battery myself, with one twice the original capacity, same as the ""elite s+. . ""  I also made my own 18cm disc with replaceable knives. With those upgrades, it managed my backyard relatively easily, although I did those upgrades after the fast growing season. Still I dont think it will have much trouble with the back yard alone next year.\n\nMore recently I added my front and side yard. Another \\~200m2 combined, but there is not much grass to mow there,  its more moss and weeds.  But lets just say it struggles, or will struggle once the growing season begins again, without GPS it will often spend half its battery being ""stuck"" in the small side lawn, gong over the same areas over and over while the back yard is only half mowed. A GPS for sure would help, but even then Im not sure it will actually manage when I redo my front lawn. So I also doubt the elite s+, rated for 1300m2 could, even if my lawn is only \\~1/3 of that.', 'I think the more appropriate question is: would a robot that is advertised for 700m2 work on 500m2 lawn? And the answer is: it will depend, but dont bet on it.\n\nThose numbers are fairly meaningless as  there are so many variables; how many hours per day (or night) can you afford to run it? How picky are you about the entire lawn being mowed perfectly? How complex is your lawn? Do you often have rain for many days after which the robot will have to ""catch up""?  how much do you mind if that takes several days. How fast does your grass grow?\n\nAs a rule of thumb I would take manufacturers estimates as a best case scenario. I wish they would provide more useful and comparable numbers like how many m2 per hour does it mow and how many hours per day can it mow. Multiplying those wouldnt translate to your lawn size, not with random navigation robots who will spend most of their time mowing already mowed grass, but at least you could compare models more accurately. \n\nAs for what the difference are; some are artificial, some robot mowers will software limit the number of hours per day it will work. Other differences are obviously battery run time (and charge time), disc size, speed and how efficiently it can navigate, especially in complex yards.\n\nTL;DR: probably not, unless maybe if you have a simple lawn geometry, grass that doesnt grow fast, you are not too picky and can run the robot as often as needed.', '>the 2 cm size increase is not that significant.\n\nMath says its a 12.5% increase.

So theoretical best case, fully charging a battery will take 4 hours (2Ah 20V battery). ouch. Then it will run for an hour, an hour and a half tops? I would not buy that if I was you. For reference, my L15 originally had a 2500mAH  27V battery (so >50% more capacity), which was enough for 1.5-2 hours mowing, and it charges in an hour. So it could mow what, 4x as much per day? And that wasnt enough for my much smaller garden.']"
"['That looks close to 100% slope (45 degree).

But its kinda big and well.. **very** expensive.

"['Recently my Ambrogio L15 battery died. The mowing time was reduced significantly and lately it just started dying in the middle of the lawn. It lasted around 500 cycles over 2.5 years. Which is longer than it took for the motors to wear out, but thats a different story. Instead of buying a new one for 150 euro, I decided to just replace the cells and reuse the battery management PCB. I used similar capacity 2500 mAH cells, 4.6 euro per cell. x7 would be \\~32 euro.\n\nBut hey, if you are soldering and considering how cheap cells are, why not double that? There is enough room. So I made a 7S2P pack. 5000mAH. 130Wh. By putting the extra 7 batteries in parallel, you dont change voltages or anything that the BMS needs to know, it can still charge and balance the pack, the only real change is that you double the capacity. Should be good for 4-5 hours of mowing. I assumed charge time would also double or close to it, so the number of hours per day it can mow wouldnt have changed a lot, but you would have more mowing hours if you dont mow at night or when it rains, and it would be more efficient as you lose less time going to/from the dock.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, there appears to be a software timer limit on the L15. After exactly 2.5 hours, it goes back to the dock, despite still having a 50% charge. Thats a bummer.  Not much gain. The original pack lasted around 2 hours when it was new. But at least it should be able to mow that long now, no matter the conditions (long/wet grass) and there isnt a chance it will run out of juice trying to return to the dock.\n\nI dont recommend anyone try this if you dont know what you are doing. Lipos are no joke. Dont mess with it. You also need the right equipment; you really want to have a spotwelder for the cells. I use this one, costs 50 euro and works a treat: [https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08DD86X91/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o01\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08DD86X91/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\nYou also need a reflow heat gun or a high power, high capacity soldering iron and lots of flux to solder the nickel strips to the PCB. That was a really tricky soldering job. That said, if you have the skills but not the equipment, you can buy the cells, a spot welder and a heat gun for less than the price of a replacement battery.\n\nFor the cells; buying 18650s online is a minefield. Beware. So many fakes even on places like amazon. If you have a trusted source of LG or samsung cells, I would go for some LG 3500mAh batteries.That will be a nice upgrade over most standard cells even if you keep the cell count indentical. If you can double the cell count,  it would yield nearly 3x the capacity of the original, which is probably overkill, especially if your mower has a software limit like mine, but I like overkill :)\n\nI dont have a source for LG or samsung that I trust, so I decided on hobbyking turnigy and they only go up to 2500mAH. Ive been using turnigy lipo batteries for my RC hobbies for decades, and find them excellent, and incredible value. I also find they generally meet or even exceed their capacity claims. Now these are not the best or highest rated cells on the planet, I wouldnt put them in a 100W vape pen or a racing drone, but you dont need extreme cells for something that will discharge slowly over 4 hours (4 hours mean 1/4C while the cells are rated for 8C).\n\nWill they do 500 cycles, or rather, 1000 ""half cycles"" ?  I have no idea, most of my experience with turnigy\'s is in RC with high/extreme loads and you do not expect 500 cycles when you pull 100s of amps and drain batteries in 3 minutes while praying it wont explode. But having twice the capacity of the original means my pack will do less than half the (full) cycles of a normal pack for the same run time. Per cell the load is also halved, so its likely to outlast the original pack by a significant margin. Even if not, considering the price, Im not too worried.']"

"[""Hello, most robot mowers have issues with invisible dog fences, however, take a look at Ambrogio robot mowers. Although it is not guaranteed to work with your fence, based on tests with customers, it has an excellent chance.

Ambrogio uses a digital signal and has the possibility of changing the channel to one of eight channels. In a different case, there was some interference and only the channel had to be changed to resolve the issue.\n\nTo help you understand, in the case of Ambrogio robot mower, if there is an issue, the robot will work fine, but the signal will deplete the signal of the dog fence. That is, the dog can run away. This is probably typical for all brands.\n\nAnother benefit of Ambrogio robot mowers is the signal is not transmitted when the robot is docked. Many dogs use the yard on a schedule, so it would be easy to time the dog's use of the yard to be when the robot is in the dock.\n\nLastly, Ambrogio is the only brand that offers an accessory for your pet's collar that will cause the blade to turn off and the robot to turn away.

They basically confirmed what I already thought: I could realistically expect their top-of-the-line model to take care of about 50% of my lawn. \n\nOf course your lawn may not be as difficult as mine. Like I said, my lawn is pretty big (between 1-1.5 acres), has patches with trees, shrubs, hills, etc. Plus there are really (in robo-lawnmower terms) 4 ""zones"" on my yard (2 in the back divided by trees and shrubs, two in the front divided by my driveway).\n\nThese things would be ideal if you lived in the suburbs and have a square in front of your house, a square behind your house, and a rectangle on the side of your house totally maybe .5 to .75 acres but that\'s just not my situation... With a riding mower I can do about 75% of my lawn in 45 minutes, but then I have to use a push mower for an hour to do the tricky/steep bits... A robo-mower could do the parts I do with the riding mower (in 3-4 hours) but I\'d still have to do the parts that I hate the most :)...']"
