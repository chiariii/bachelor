"[""So first of all, you should NOT have any severely dirty boxes...that is how your cats can get a UTI or even a blockage.

You can't yank his litter box away until you know he's using the LR.  With my new cat, I started out with her litter box in the normal place, then each day I pulled it closer and closer to the LR.  I left the LR off.  Eventually I had it next to the LR.  I started putting some of the poop from the old pan into the LR, and let the pan get dirty.  Eventually she used it and started to prefer using it to the dirty pan.  You will probably have to scoop the poop from it and your other cats will probably use it too for awhile.  I had 3 other cats at the time too, and while I was introducing the 4th to the LR, they used her old pan but still used the LR.  When I finally got rid of the pan, they all went back to using the LR quickly with no issues.  I'd also suggest putting a webcam on your box so you can see when he's finally using it.\n\nYou might have to put some treats or catnip on the steps to entice him.

"['I have owned every iteration of LR and have two cats. I have also left the house for several days. The original and the LR II never got stuck, but they were messy. The flat front often got pooped on the edge and when the unit would cycle, the poop would go all over the buttons. The LR 3 solved that by angling the globe backwards. The LR 3 Connect was identical, except it added WiFi. The 3 was a solid and reliable unit, but after it aged a few years, there were metal contacts — vital to its operation — that would get corroded, causing all sorts of problems. It never got stuck while I was away, but that was only because it hadn’t aged to that point yet. Enter the LR 4. I was fully paid and on the waiting list for 10 - 12 weeks. It finally arrived and I set it up. It worked for about a week then started throwing errors. I was disappointed to say the least. Whisker sent me a replacement base. Worked a week and same thing. Now I’m getting disgusted. I learned that Whisker could send firmware updates. I got what they had as they were released, and one by one, the issues were disappearing. Every update fixed a little more. It finally got to the point where it was running pretty darn good, except . . . The unit would throw a cycle interrupted error every few cycles. I quickly learned that this error would resolve itself and after 10 seconds, the box would resume and complete the cycle. That went on for a couple of months. Then last week, there was another update which fixed that. At last, my LR 4 began running absolutely PERFECTLY! In the end, the LR 4 is a beast! It is an engineering marvel! It’s as close to being silent when running as possible. To sum up, all the problems people have been grumbling and upset about on here have been rectified by firmware updates. The exception is the occasional unit that arrives DOA or has a major gross problem that you just know isn’t right. But that’s what Whisker’s OUTSTANDING support is for. They will promptly replace defective units. Sadly, there are an ample amount of folks out there that don’t read the instructions. Then when things aren’t working, they don’t know that there are updates, so jump on here and proclaim the unit to be junk, when with a little patience and reading, they could be enjoying a machine that works beautifully. If the LR 4 could change its own waste bags, refill its own litter, and occasionally blow off its own sensors, I would absolutely trust it to do its job, unattended, for months at a time.', ""I have 2 cats and an LR4, and I am happy to report I don't have to scoop every day any more. Instead, I just pull out the drawer and bag it every 4-5 days. (Two cats, mind you) That's where the fairytale ends.\n\nI travel a few times a year, so i have to be away from them for up to a week or two at a time. So, I hire people to come and feed them, play with them and make sure the litter box is all set. It is not easy to come up with a set of instructions that a person that's never seen LR4 before can understand and use  especially if it involves troubleshooting. \n\nI know what to do when a solid red won't go away, but it is unfair to expect it from a random cat sitter.\n\nIf you leave for any number of days, just leave a regular litterbox - every cat sitter knows how to scoop. LR4 does not fail often, but when it does, you don't want to leave it up to chance.""]"

"[""You need to eliminate the smell entirely or the cat will keep peeing there. Cats have a much better sense of smell than we do and the scent of urine tells them it's okay to keep peeing there. Did you use an enzyme cleaner specifically intended for cat urine? It so, you probably have to treat it again. \n\nIf it was on carpet the urine soaks down into the carpet pad and hard floor underneath and spreads out so you have to saturate the area around the spot too. Cover the area with plastic to keep it wet for a day or so while the enzymes eat away the urine crystals. Trash bags work well. Once it's dry put an object over the spot for a few days.""]"

It's a good company and I hate to see someone shitting on it, despite the shit-show the LR4 was at launch, and despite the recent shipping/packaging/integrity issues. My only complaint is that they be a bit more transparent regarding the future, whether it be firmware, software, hardware, or something else.

"['This is a problem you will likely have with pretty much any wifi-enabled device that isn\'t a phone or PC or otherwise has some way of you opening a browser and interacting with a portal directly from the device itself.  This is a limitation of the design of the WiFi network and the complaint needs to be taken to the network administrator (which is likely a third-party and the owner of the building would know very little about any of this).  This is honestly a terrible way to setup residential internet in an age where internet-connected devices are so ubiquitous; no way you\'re the only person running into this limitation.\n\nI\'m assuming you don\'t pay an internet bill and it\'s just a ""perk"" included in your rent?  If you are having to pay a surcharge for it, consider fighting that and getting your own dedicated connection direct from an ISP instead (you\'ll get more bandwidth that way anyways and have full control over your own network).  Otherwise, you\'ll have to fight with the provider of this WiFi network to make some sort of exception that they will likely be resistant towards (assuming you can get past the tier1 helpdesk that likely won\'t go off script).  Potential solutions with cooperation from the provider:\n\n* Just give you an Ethernet port in your unit and let you set up your own WiFi network with your own equipment, without any sort of captive portal for internet access.  Aside from the actual running of the cable, the config for this should be simple on their end to still keep you segmented from other units.  They just might not like you having another SSID showing up to others and potentially competing for airspace (really not a big issue imo; other apartments everyone sets up their own wifi and their are tons of SSIDs cohabiting; not ideal but modern hardware handles it ok enough).\n* Have them setup a dedicated SSID for you without captive portal, so you just connect and go.  This would allow them to at least make the SSID ""private"" so it doesn\'t show up in the list others see when searching for a network normally.  It also still leaves them in full control of everything.  You would just have to remember the SSID and enter it into things manually (which maybe not all devices would support, but many more than can support a captive portal).\n\nThey\'re not likely to agree to either of those easily because if they do it for everyone then they may as well just completely redesign their entire approach to providing this service (which I think they should anyways since this has to be a pretty common issue with all the smart devices people are using nowadays).  So, the last thing you can try, which will need to be done for every new device you want to add (including every time you potentially RMA a device), is to ask them to make some sort of MAC address exception where the network recognizes the device and just lets it bypass the portal.  This is the only solution that doesn\'t require them to really change much about their network, but the more they do it, the messier it becomes for everyone, so I really don\'t like it.  Then again, I just really don\'t like this whole design for residential access.  Captive portals are meant for guests, like free wifi at a cafe or visitors at an office, or even guests in your home, situations where nobody should need to connect a device that isn\'t able to open a web browser and interact with a portal, and where you specifically want them to agree to terms every time.  It\'s not a hoop anyone should have to jump through in their own home.']"

But you may want to go back to the main page of the sub and search “20 pound” in the top bar. I saw several posts of others with large cats. One person even had a 26-pounder who they said loved their LR. Best of luck to you.', 'My also chunky (21 lbs) cat was terrified of ours when we first got it.

He retaliated by peeing anywhere he wasn’t supposed to. I brought the old box back out, and continued to scoop his box twice a week but left less and less litter inside it until it was literally empty. Leaving the box in its place so as not to disturb his normal surroundings, but making it an ineffective place to use the bathroom seemed to do the trick.

I would also try keeping the cat afraid of it inside a small room with only the litter bot as an option to use. Maybe have some of his old litter inside it too. You might not want to do this, because you may feel bad, but I've had success in the past with feral cats getting use to litter robots inside a smaller room for a few days. Like I kept them in a small room for a couple of days feeding them there. I try not to place any cats inside the bot, because I feel like it will only make them hate it, but that's just my opinion.

Sometimes he would poop in it, sometimes right outside.

After the pinch detect switch is reinstalled, use a petroleum jelly on the contact points. Encase it completely with the petroleum jelly, (see pic below). This will eliminate the errant pinch detect errors and allow normal functionality of the switch. The glob of petroleum jelly over time will collect a lot of litter and debris on it's exterior, but the contact points inside will remain pristine and connected!!! I've done this to all 3 of my LR3's over a year ago, so far not a single errant pinch detect issue since!!!\n\nHope this helps?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wu17ldfea5b1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2961e8ca6087cbf3b9267c05ac56612212e2e012""]"
"[""That clicking sound is a detent or stop for an internal shield that was part of the globe but omitted years ago. Instead of changing the design that moved the shield internally they left it there. So if your black key in the back is out of sequence it will overrun the detent make the globe lurch upward trying to overcome the torque needed to get past the detent and causes this issue.\n\nThe fix is simple! \n\nWith your globe in the home position, (liner at the bottom filled with litter), lift the back of the globe and rotate the black key clockwise till the key ends up at the 1 o'clock position, it will stop at the detent and stay there, now simply move it counter clockwise and let it freely dangle at the 6 o'clock position, (it should swing freely like a pendulum), (if its binding remove the Philips screw from the back key to the plug inside the globe disassemble the 3 pieces and clean the hole the two pieces go through on the globe so its free, NO lube required).\n\nIf its free and at the 6 o clock position set the globe and key in their respective slots on the base, clean the bonnet and the bases electrical connections, install the bonnet and test cycle the LR, there should be no more clicks and lurches! \n\nHope this helps?.""]"

"[""Not sure if you've tried any of this, but LR has a tips and tricks page that might help:\n\n[https://www.litter-robot.com/acclimating-your-cat.html](https://www.litter-robot.com/acclimating-your-cat.html)"", ""We have two cats. Our boy cat was super scared of it when we got it, we were dummies and it ran before it was even ready to be used so they were both really scared. We left our other box out for a week or so, it got worse and worse in there and within a few days the girl cat was using the robot without issue, but the boy cat still wouldn't.\n\nSo then we did the following for about a week: \n\n1. We unplugged it so it couldn't run and whenever  it filled up from the girl using it we would lock the cats in another room and run it so it would get clean.\n\n2. We kept the old box out for a few more days and would partially clean it as needed to keep things less gross.\n\n3. Many times throughout the day. Whenever we would see the scared boy cat go over to the robot to check it out, we would sit with him while he did it and give him treats. We started putting treats on the step for him to grab, and we'd try physically putting him in the box- he'd always jump right back out but we'd give him a treat as a reward and be talking encouragingly to him the whole time.\n\n4. After probably 1.5-2 weeks of this, of constantly acclimating him, manually running the box so they couldn't see. Giving him treats whenever he was being brave, etc. He finally used it. It was so exciting.\n\n5. After he used it the first time we kept the old box around just in case, and with him having used it a few days in a row we tested out letting the cats watch it run. It freaked them out at first, but we sat with them while it ran and gave them treats. We were worried but he kept using it after that too, so now both our cats were using it consistently.\n\nIt's been like 3 months now and we've had no issues. Our boy cat still doesn't trust it, he's a little scaredy cat.\n\nEvery time he hears it running he has to sprint over and watch it, and often he'll climb inside ir onto the front step while it's running and it will have to pause the cycle. He'll do that 3-4 times during one cycle and I'll get like 4 notifications about it while I'm at work. It doesn't cause any issues though and it's actually kind of cute!\n\nHang in there, your cat will get it, it takes patience and encouragement, gradually weening them off their box, being there with them and rewarding them for being curious about the robot. You'll get there, and I'll tell you it was worth the effort. I was skeptical during the break-in period and didn't think it would work, but now I'm glad we made the effort."", 'My guy was freaked by the cycle too. Now he seems to view it as something to be dominated. I’m new to LR and experienced folks provided good guidance like- leave it off, you hang out next to it when you turn it on & it immediately cycles and give cat love love to allay their fears, you play with a toy while it cycles. Anything to associate it with the positive. I went away for 8 days, had cat sitters and the LR performed very well. Sherman used it consistently. Hope that helps!!', 'Have you tried adding some of their old litter to it? I did this as well as kept my cats regular litter box out for a bit to acclimate my really skittish kitty.

I fed him right next to the box, used the cat attract.. he went right in front of the steps. ???? Lol Is this progress? He actually used it once before the cat attract got here and I was SO excited. Then I sprinkled some cat attract to keep up the good behavior and now this happens. I put it all inside the litter box instead of throwing it out maybe that will help. I appreciate you guys!', 'This may be unpopular but I put a little bit of old litter in our LR, put it in the same place as the old, and eliminated the old completely. My one cat is a super anxious cat, but she used it from the start. Started with it unplugged. \n\nIt took them a few days to really quit interrupting it constantly, but they took to it really fast. I do find it helpful to put it in sleep mode at night. I woke up to faults in the beginning from not doing this. I think with it being so quiet at night, they wouldn’t leave it alone at night lol \n\nI was feeling regrets that first week, but quickly realized I couldn’t live without it. Lol I won’t go back. It just takes a little time for the novelty to wear off, or apprehension with some cats.']"
"[""tldr: basically an outrageously priced box to collect poop, and the smell seeps into the plastic and stinks.  Return or spend a whole bunch of more money accommodating the LR. Regular box is way less maintenance, even with scooping. Not actually ideal for cats, mostly an optimistoc idea for humans\n\nIt didn't work for me. The reality of the litter robot is basically a box of poop marinating in your house. I really wasn't okay with knowing the cat poop just sits there for like a whole week. But, no youtube reviews/influencers had anything  bad to say about the litter robot, obviously because they got sent the litter robots for free \U0001fae0duh, or they didn't have it long enough, and this sub is an echo chamber. So i drank the Kool-Aid and decided to give it a try. My initial thought was right though, its a box of poop marinating in your house. \n\nThe waste never really dries out before it plops into the drawer. It smelled bad, and I could smell it when it turned and when the drawer got close to full.  Yet i had this aversion to changing the bag just because it smelled so bad. So naturally, it was not something i wanted to do until i had to. \n\nI've only had it in use for 2 weeks and that SMELL SEEPED INTO THE PLASTIC of the drawer, the base and into the globe, in the space behind the carbon filter, which faces the drawer when the globe is not in motion. Because the liner part of the globe has to drop when it turns, there has to be some sort of opening to let air in and out. That opening is behind the carbon filter directly on the other side from the magnet weight. The smell got all in there. it's gross. You can never get it out. \n\nSo it basically smelled all the time, and in the month of having it, i had already had to deep clean it twice (3 times including the cleaning before i sent it back). Not only that, but it took 2 weekends away from me and about 5 hours each weekend trying to scrub the f*cking smell out of it. \n\nIt gave me constant anxiety about smell and cleanliness. Like a box of poop in your house just isn't sanitary. I was constantly f*cking worried about it. Plus, i spent a ton of money outside of that $800 on extra things to get the smell out, deodorizers, experimenting with litters, and ended up using way more litter because I had to add some to the bag in the drawer all the time.  \n\nAll the freaking mods and contraptions people build around the LR to make it work for them, just to not scoop, is not only ridoculous but astronomically more expensive than just having a regular box.\n\nI never actually had a problem with the regular litter box. It never smelled. Yeah, i didn't like scooping, but i did twice a day to keep it clean, and it was way less maintenance. I can see how people who tuck this into an extra room or the basement and never have to see it can deal with it. It's just gross whether your house is big enough or not, but ours also isn't.\n\nAll of those reasons are about me, but most importantly than anything, the litter robot is just not ideal for cats. It's too small, too closed up, and there is not 3-4in of litter in there for an enriched litter box experience for the cat. Plus, the cats get in and basically bump their head into the back of it where dirty litter and poop slide. That is gross. Imagine having to use a small porta potty all the time and basically face where your poop was just smeared.\n\nI put a regular box back out, and my cats immediately started using it instead, and I couldn't be happier getting the LR4 out of my house. Id much rather just scoop. \n\nI have no idea how people say it doesn't smell, bcuz it stinks. I have no idea how people say its easy to clean or how someone posted a pic of 6 LRs and said it takes them less time than cleaning the same # of regular boxes. I have no idea how people suggest Dr. Elsy's because it sucks.""]"

Start talking money and hours and compensation, keep a running total and mention it often. I don\'t talk on the phone for free either, so start the clock, I don\'t mind holding. I know it will be awhile and I\'m patient, you\'re dealing with 50 people as pissed off as I am on 1 phone line that accepts calls from 9:03 to 9:18 daily and you have to have time to wiggle out of your warranty. I support the process. It must take at least 3 seconds to send the same daily video to the same 50 people for a week while subtly suggesting we\'re idiots and don\'t understand how businesses work in this trying time after 3 years of COVID and of course "" Nobody wants to work anymore and we\'re short handed"". A reminder that they don\'t seem to have labor problems while SELLING and manufacturing their shit proved to be helpful. Of course I had to update my labor charges because I had to listen to every excuse in the world. Finally told Daniel he deserved better than this and whatever he\'s paid isn\'t worth it. Got a tracking notification from Whisker 20 minutes later and my base was on my doorstep the next day. I knew it wasn\'t going to take 6weeks to ship from Wisconsin to Chicago. Why Whisker? Did you attend a business seminar given by My Pillow? Is your CEO so bad only Mike Lindell makes him look good? FUN FACT, nowhere in the warranty is it mentioned they will only provide parts. Make the Rep read it to you verbatim, it was the first time it had been read by the poor guy that had to clean up Whiskers shit sandwich. My hope is poor Daniel has riden off into the sunset in search of greener and more honorable pastures. So fucked up that a company that mechanized a circle and charges close to a 1000 dollars won\'t honor the warranty. Clearly they have no faith in their product. To those of you paying for furniture that is basically the cheapest, shittiest, thinnest,  particle board known to man, coated in crappy thin plastic, of varying colors that don\'t match, applied by a stoned, blind, dyslexic 80 year old giraffe, Go buy 10 3 inch screws, 2 1x6x8\'s and a mitre saw. Drop some acid, get blind drunk and start building. It\'ll look 10 times better and last for years. Fuck, go get 4 broken pallets and some bungee cords. Even without the acid it\'ll be more usable and more attractive than anything Whisker sells. They allowed me to keep the base. I have access to a 3d printer and a kid in college studying to be an engineer. Stay tuned. I\'m hoping to have a better product available soon. Do you really need to know your cat\'s weight before and after a shit? Is it really all that handy to monitor the waste drawer remotely? It\'s not like you can change it from work. My neighbor has the Litter Robot 2. 4 cats and 10 years later it\'s still kicking ass. A motorized gear, a belt, a rubber diaphragm, and a screen. She actually walks 14 feet a couple of days a week and glances at the litter volume and if she\'s really feeling like a good cat mom, she\'ll bend over and open the drawer like a caveman.

It doesn’t always arrive a damaged mess and when it is I’ve never been expected to take it to FedEx and handle returning it. I can easily spend $100+ on a task rabbit to return what? Trash? This thing isn’t even useable. Whisker can “easily” just say trash it or give it away. Personally I’d rather it go back so I don’t have to deal with it but even keeping it and getting rid of it is easier than taking it to FedEx. Someone in a Buy Nothing group would gladly take it. Companies can submit claims on items damaged from shipping carriers. I work in eCommerce there are so many easy solutions to this that don’t require putting the pain on the customer.

I’ve bought items online that weigh more than this, and when they were delivered damaged, it was an easy fix. My issue was resolved. They are picking it up. I am content with the outcome. Had I known this was their policy, I would have reconsidered my purchase, so I am sharing my experience.

It would be nice to bypass the autopets server while home and still be able to use the app.\n\n- There is no way to reset the cat sensor from the app. Sometimes I can tell without even being in the same room or looking at anything that the cat triggered the sensor without doing anything.\n\n- I would have appreciated more notification options like ""pet weight recorded"", ""waste bin is XX% full"" (configurable), ""litter level is below configured threshold""\n\n- The 10-second delay that 2.83 would\'ve included should actually be user-configurable, because my cats will poke around for longer than that most of the time.', ""The major issue for me is that this thing is almost a thousand dollars and it feels like it's not a complete product. \n\nLiterally. \n\nIt's what some people pay for rent.\n\nI paid approx 1,600 for two LR4, two mats, 2 extra packs of bags, and a scent pack.\n\nYet, as soon as I pulled them out of the box, one of them was in horrible condition.

"[""When you thoroughly cleaned the base unit did you remove the weight sensor from the bottom half of the base and reinstall afterwards.  If you left it in place you can wash the plastics but afterwards you need to use compressed air and a heat gun or hair dryer to thoroughly dry the sensor and related components. Failure to completely dry will throw off the sensor due to moisture intrusion and cause the issue you are having. If you did remove the sensor it has to be recalibrated, its a simple procedure with an VOM, you are looking for the lowest resistance possible, (anywhere between 400 and 600 ohms). Or if you want to rough it in, just tighten the nut down till it bottoms out on the threads then back it off two to three turns and go from there.\n\nThere's an internal recalibration in conjunction with the physical recalibration as well to optimize the weight sensor that you can do as well, here's how:\n\nafter adjusting the weight sensor nut / lowest ohms, and getting the unit to the ready status (blue light).\n\nRemove and empty the waste drawer and place back in the base unit.\n\nRemove both the bonnet and globe, place the bonnet only back on the base and press reset.\n\nWith nothing touching the base aside from the control panel buttons, press and HOLD the EMPTY & RESET buttons for 5 to 6 seconds or till the red light flashes fast, then let go of the buttons.

"[""I'm sure by your description that you keep the top of the base unit and the globe clean so any obstructions between the base and globe could be ruled out. The litter level doesn't exceed the fill line on the liner? Etc... Here are a few thing that the Whisker troubleshooter doesn't cover that might help you determine the exact cause of your concern. \n\nGlobe key: Does your globe key at the back of the globe turn freely? It should turn freely one way and also turn freely the other way depending on the location you started to rotate the key in the opposite direction, catch on a stop. but the main thing is if it turns freely with no binding till it hits the stop. If there is binding (in rare cases urine can get in there with kitty litter dust causing a sludge buildup) you need to disassemble (Philips screw at the back of the key) clean and reassemble.\n\nLoose pinion gear: The black pinion gear attached to the output shaft of the drive motor assembly can work its way loose and drift on the shaft a bit, this can cause binding and excessive load on the drive motor causing an over torque error. The solution is to push the gear closest to the drive motor case, tighten the 2.5mm Allen head set screw at the base of the pinion gear.\n\nLoss of lubrication: The drive motor / gear reduction case comes from the factory with a VERY light skim coating of dampening grease. This is done to reduce the drag caused by excessive amounts of lubrication. The unfortunate side effect is the gear box looses lubrication on the shafts the gears rotate on and they begin to chatter, this chatter causes a tremendous amount of rotational drag on the motor triggering the over torque fault. The solution is to disassemble the gear box and apply a thin coating of grease to the gears and mainly the shafts they rotate on, then run the LR with no globe to help work the grease through so the motor runs freely before putting the LR back in to service to prevent any further over torque errors caused by the lubrication.\n\nDrive motor failure: The motor its self can sometimes loose an internal winding or have a winding short, this in turn causes the motor to run slightly faster than normal with an increased current draw, but the trade off is the torque of the motor is reduced. Sometimes when the motor is in operation you will hear a faint tapping sound like some debris got caught in the gears but in reality its the motor. If this is the case there is a visual tell tail sign that could tip you off to this. observe the litter level in the globe, normally if the motor is working as intended the litter level will be close to spot on with the litter level indicator on the liner. BUT!, if the motor is running slightly fast the globe will overshoot the normal litter leveling position and cause the litter to be higher on the right side and lower on the left side. \n\nI've had this happen a few times on 2 different LR3's one the motor eventually let the magic smoke out and the other still gives over torque errors!, replacing the motors resolved the concerns.\n\nIf you are using the on line troubleshooter and feel like you have dropped off the radar, just submit the ticket again, (Its what I've done in the past and it worked for me) let them know this is your second attempt and be as precise and to the point as possible in your explanation of how you determined what the problem is and or symptoms. Even though it is frustrating and maddening to feel like you have been forgotten, I found being professional yields quick results!!!\n\nHope these tips can help you determine the cause and expedite the warranty process for you."", ""I'm fairly certain I am past any return date, seeing as the unit will be a year old in 3 months.\n\nI initiated a chat session at a little past 8:00 AM this morning, Central US time, but have yet to have an agent join.""]"

I spoke with someone and asked how I would go about filing a stolen item claim, as it was not of insignificant value and possibly not discreetly packaged. THAT seemed to have made them really want to look into finding it quickly, and the next day, I got a call back telling me it was on the next truck and I'd be able to pick it up by 6pm.""]"

"[""What your LR is experiencing is a DFI failure. The pinch detect circuit is part of the DFI and this is the reason why when the globe is in the dump position the base attempts to change direction, and does for a split second, (this is when the pinch detect becomes active once again) and since the DFI has malfunctioned it thinks a pinch is in progress and reverses the direction of the globe once again, overshooting the waste port on the base causing the globe to lurch upward and make a clicking sound, then stopping with a fast flashing yellow light.\n\nIf you are still in warranty, you can go to the Whisker on line [TROUBLESHOOTER](https://apcp.my.site.com/s/whisker-troubleshooting-router?language=en_US&product=LR3) for a fast blinking yellow light and submit a trouble ticket.\n\nIf you are not in warranty you can get a replacement DFI for $30 from [HERE](https://www.robotshop.com/products/litter-robot-3-open-air-dfi-hardware-v2).\n\nIf you need a guide on replacing the DFI, go to this [HOW TO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmXy7PBaiIQ&t=492s) video.\n\nIf you have SMT soldering skills this problem is repairable, but if you don't I HIGHLY suggest obtaining the replacement DFI.\n\nHope this helps you?""]"

I’m partly using Pretty Litter because it’s mentioned by name as a useable litter on the LR website so I figure using it won’t void the warranty. Mostly I’m using it because one of my guys got some bladder crystals and had some hematuria. I only found out because he peed in an empty box while I was cleaning it. It wasn’t enough blood to be visible on the clay. Using pretty litter helped me track for resolution of blood in the urine and keep track of urine pH since alkalinity caused the problem. Since the problem was only happening with one of my guys it was easy to keep tabs, but if I start noticing issues again I might have to do some detective work. It seems to be about the same price as other crystal litters and works at least as well with the added bonus of the pH indicator. As far as downsides, I’ve heard the yellow color it turns with normal pH urine described as well buttered popcorn and I can’t really unhear that description.', ""I use pretty litter with 3 cats so the color changing is a bit harder to figure out which cat it is BUT it did help me catch a uti just like super recently.

"['If you a get a unit that’s defect-free from the factory and which doesn’t sustain damage while being shipped, it’s a good unit. I’ve had both the LR3 and the LR4. The 4 is an improvement over the 3 in every way. I literally would not have cats if this technology didn’t exist. You have up until the end of the first year to buy the extended warranty, and you have 90 days to return it. That’s more than enough time for most people and most cats. It is entirely possible that you’ll have cats who do abnormal things with the robot. Things like peeing with their rear end facing the front or just being too scared to use it at all. Read through the threads—plenty of people have posted tips on acclimating your cat. Most important: don’t turn it on when the cats are nearby when you first get it. Know that plugging it in will cause it to automatically run a cycle and can scare the hell out of cats, making it much harder to get them to use it. You’ll still want to plug it in right away, just to make sure FedEx didn’t mess it up, but I’d recommend having the cats as far away as possible when you do. Do manual cycles until they’re definitely both using it, then try running a cycle with them in the room while you’re giving some positive feedback like favorite treats.', 'I’ve had the LR3 since Oct 2020, and I really couldn’t be happier, both with the product, and with the company/customer support.  The components can be purchased separately, so even if something goes wrong outside of the warranty period, you would only need to replace a part, and not the entire unit.  For the 3, a common wear & tear part is the dfi/pinch sensor, and it’s only $30.  It can become corroded from exposure to high humidity, but after two and a half years, I havn’t seen any corrosion on mine.  It’s something to watch out for, and if you’re using a litter that doesn’t dry out well (like sole alternative plant based litters), it may lead to needing to replace sensors more frequently.  \nI honestly can’t imagine going back to scooping.  Maintenance, for me, has been changing the bag weekly, and an occasionally wipe down.  Some people completely disassemble the LR and spray it down to clean it, but I think that really depends on how your cats use it.  If they aim well (meaning going in the litter, and not spraying upwards), it’s really not necessary to do more than a quick wipe down.', 'We have the LR4 for our two cats and I couldn’t imagine not having it. It was so hard to keep up with two cats and no matter how often we scooped it always just stunk up the area. \nSince getting the LR we barely have to sweep up litter around the area & its stopped them from flicking old turds onto the floor because it’s constantly cleaning itself. It’s also really good at trapping that litter box smell, we deep clean once a month and use wipes every now and again for a refresh.  Also I believe you have 90 days to return it, and I think that’s enough time to figure out if it works for you & your kitty. \nImo it’s worth the money, as long as you make sure it’s clean and treat it with care it will work great.', ""The price is absolutely stupid. I just paid $1200 CAD to upgrade to the LR4 with the extended warranty. It's worth maybe half that but I'm so hooked on the stupid machines that I paid it anyway. My LR3 crapped out and I can't stand scooping so I decided to try the new model. LR3 always smelled so bad. The LR4 so far seems significantly better in that respect. It's also way more quiet and less ugly. I don't care for the app statistics on my cat's bathroom habits and I feel like that's inflating the price but overall I'm happy with the LR4. I just wish it didn't cost so much. It's absolutely overpriced."", ""I was there with you a few months ago. I ended up buying the lr4 with the extended warranty. My thought was to try it for 90 days and return it if it didn't work out. \nIt took 5 mins for one of boys to use it and the other was a few days. In the first week I knew it would be staying in my home. It's amazing! No scooping, no smell and my boys are happier. It's been 6month with it and I can't ever go back to a reg box.\nNow just like others have said you still need to do things. I change the bag about every 4 to 5 days. When I do bag changes I wipe down the inside of the Globe and outside. All of that doesn't compare to scooping daily and washing out two manual litter boxes every weekend.\nAnother bonus is that I save money on litter. It just uses less! Even with buy the more expensive litter I still save. I use the litter robot litter.\n\nTake the plunge and both you and your cat will be happier"", ""I agree on the app but it helped me catch a uti from my cat so now I'm 50/50 on it.""]"

Mine has no odor which is awesome!"", ""I got the LR4 after buying a used LR3 on fb marketplace and using it for about a year. I've got to say, I absolutely love the LR4 in comparison. It's a huge improvement from the 3. \n\nOne: the cat sensor is way better. It's not just a weight sensor, it's this laser/light sensor that gets tripped even when a cat sticks their head into the litter box. I can wave my hand inside the globe and it trips the sensor. I feel like this is way safer for my cats, especially because I just got 2 kittens which are very small and won't trip the weight sensor the LR3, and so it might still spin with them still inside. \n\nTwo: the smell is way better and more contained. Even using the carbon filters (i put an extra two more in my LR3), the LR4 doesn't smell at all (after it's cycled) whereas I still smell the LR3 all the time. \n\nThree: the drawer is bigger I believe and I don't have to empty it as often\n\nFour: I don't have the random errors that the LR3 was always having, like over torque error, bonnet error, etc. The only error I had was a cat sensor error, which was fixed by cleaning off the sensor because it got dirty from the clay litter powder in the air. \n\nI have both the LR3 and 4 set up and my cats like using either of them. They don't seem to have a preference. I did buy the connect module for the LR3, so I could use the app for both. It's been super helpful because now I know what errors are happening on my LR3. They both show the waste level. But the LR4 also shows the litter level and if you need to refill it. \n\nI have my LR4 sitting on the mats that are meant to catch litter. I'm not sure if this has the same effect as with carpet. But I do notice that the weights that the app is telling me for my cats is wrong. Both my adult cats are 12lbs, but it's telling me that they weigh 9.3lbs most of the time. So i'm not sure if this would change if i put the LR4 on hardwood floor or not. But I don't really care about the weight feature since I have an infant scale that I use to weigh my cats. I honestly don't think you'll have any issues with sitting yours on carpet except for the cats weight and for the litter that gets tracked outside on your cats paws. So i would suggest a mat of some sort to contain that. \n\nI bought my LR4 new, and I'm doing the payment plan for a year.

For example today we had a cat use it and over 3 hours later it was still waiting to cycle (supposed to cycle after 7 minutes). We had to reboot it. Part of the reason we got it was so we could go away for a few days without worrying about the litter getting too gross, but we don't feel we can trust not checking it at least daily at this point.

"['Hey everyone! I\'m a vet tech and cat exhibitor/breeder, I\'d love to share my fix! Previously, I\'ve gone down a similar road with multiple mats. Unfortunately, in my situation, I found that the mats only exacerbated the smells of \'accidents\' that inevitably occurred. Whether by vomiting episodes, urine marking/missing the box, or the occasional bout of diarrhea it created 10x the amount of work for me by now needing to constantly clean the mats as well. In my case, this involved multiple trips (and lots of extra $$$) to the laundromat :( \n\nBefore I had the litter robot, I bought the largest reasonably priced plastic dog crate I could find (at Menards). I used the top portion and the bottom portion separately and placed my XL litter boxes inside.

These are 1/3rd the price of a dog crate. They aren\'t as deep or high-sided as the crates, yet they work wonderfully for me! I simply use a hand vacuum when I empty the litter robot drawers, and if necessary can hose them off in the shower or bathtub. If your space is too narrow for one of these trays, another option could be a removable plastic tray from a large wire-type of dog crate.

Just a side note, the gear boxes gears and shafts they rotate on are just barely skim coated with a dampening grease out of the factory, this is done intentionally so there is little to no drag on the motor cause by the lubrication. The down side is, (depending on how much its used?) it will run dry of lubrication fairly fast causing the gears to chatter on the shafts they rotate on, this WILL cause over torque faults!\n\nThe drive motor its self is starting to fail, the tell tail sign of this happening is the globe will overshoot its position when leveling the litter in the globe causing the litter to be higher on the right side and lower on the left. This happens because the motor is rotating faster than intended due to a winding on the armature shorting, the trade off is the motors rotational torque is lessened. hence the over torque error.

"[""I make sure I vacuum under the bonnet before I leave and wipe the top of the base down and the connectors as well.

I, too, have a cat sitter familiar with LR.  I just tell her to change the bag every 2 days and that keeps it from ever getting full or stopping - by watching the trends I know that every 2 days minimum it's full, or maximum 4 days.  So I default to changing every 2.  She also pulls out the bin and shakes it once a day to make sure it's not reading full when it's actually just a poop iceberg sticking up.\n\nI honestly have never disassembled it beyond taking off the bonnet to vacuum and wipe a bit.

"['I have the LR4 and overall am happy with it. I don’t have to think much about litter boxes anymore. With 3 cats, I empty the LR4 about once every 4 or 5 days. An unexpected perk is that my litter lasts way longer and I go through much less than before. \n\nAs outlined in an earlier post of mine, I think the software is buggy at times and has room for improvement. They’re slowly rolling out updates and improvements and even with the bugs, I’d definitely buy again. \n\nWith that said, some important notes:\n\n1. Absolutely buy the extended warranty for peace of mind. \n2. If leaving the house for an extended period of time (for me that threshold is overnight), setup a back-up litter box just in case of a malfunction. \n3. Know that when you plug in the LR4 for the first time, it immediately starts cycling! They should make this abundantly clear on the packaging but they do not. Many people aren’t aware of this and their cats get scared and then don’t touch the robot for days. Instead, I recommend to keep it completely unplugged around your cat for a few days while your cat gets used to being around it.', ""Long AF reply lol\n\nI'm a huge fan (LR4) and swear by it at this point. That being said, when we first received it we had problems. It was the firmware and we ended up just waiting for the right release. My husband was mad and wanting to return it, but I was opposed and because I normally deal with that part of kitty-care, I won 😆. The fix happened a couple of months after we received it, and beyond very minor and easily fixed cleaning/dusting the cameras, there was very little we had to struggle with. \n\nMost errors can be cleared to continue its cycle with no issue. I haven't had to in quite some time.\n\n The bin below where you put in the bag to catch the mess used to infuriate me after reading it was already 30% full after totally changing it. I learned that when you put the bag in, you want to try to press it down in the empty space as smoothly as possible so that there aren't any air pockets inflating for the sensors to mistake as solid masses. Very silly tech to be fooled imho 😆 it still tells me that it's already anywhere from 5-10%, but I'm cool with that. Once the robot thinks it's full, it tends to refuse to continue. This can end up leaving the space open where the waste falls, because it thinks that waste may be stopping it from cleanly working. \n\nSpeaking of the waste bin and how to install the bag, the kind of bag does matter. You will at the very least, be encouraged to double-bag grocery bags. I greatly prefer the bags you can order from Whisker. They'll send you a sample. They're much thicker and much longer plastic. Part of why I like them is because of how easy it makes it to utilize a kind of reverse cycle to pour the litter into the waste, when you may want to completely clean inside or change the litter. Honestly, I need to add litter maybe once a week and similarly need to take out the bag of mess along that same weekly pattern.\n\nWhisker is what we use to deliver their litter, bags, filters, etc. Whisker offers a couple of different odor control items. One is a filter and the other is an 'odor pack' of scented gel beads. I started with the filter and tried the odor packs once before completely preferring the first option. It's not that the beads were bad necessarily, but they can't be put in with the filter and I didn't recognize a tremendous improvement. The filter works very well and in either instance couldn't detect odors at all.\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on it via the Whisker app. It connects to your robot, offers to nickname the machine (turd burglar), offers to send you notifications every time your kitty goes potty, to let you know of any errors immediately. For example, if your kitty is curious and pokes their cute little nose inside to figure out wtf the machine is doing, the machine stops immediately and goes in to a waiting timer to ensure the cat isnt there before it starts again. You can clear it faster by pushing a button if needed. Kitty gets a weight record (lol I used to weigh myself and then grab my tubster cat before doing bad math 😆). You want to make sure to install the litter guard and set out a good litter mat, as some kitties can be a little messy getting out after they finish.\n\nTLDR? It's an amazing machine that took a couple months to get totally working. No issues since. Whisker is highly recommended for their litter bags and filters. The wipes aren't bad either, but not really too necessary. Just easier to subscribe and get everything there. The app for Whisker is incredibly useful."", 'The LR3 was life changing - we have 4 cats and 3 bots.  We started with 1 in summer of 2019 and then ordered 2 more a month or so later once we discovered it works and the cats would use it.  The LR3 bots were fine but we upgraded to the LR4’s when they were released.   The LR4 is a game changer because of the increased litter bin capacity.  Of the 3 bots, 2 are used more heavily and we were changing every other day with the LR3 and now change every 4th day with the LR4.  \n\nWe use Dr Elsey’s Cat Attract litter (amazon subscribe and save), we use generic plastic garbage bags (also amazon subscribe and save), and then the scent packs (on auto delivery from Whisker).  We also have all the bots on smart plugs so we can power cycle remotely and have cameras on all the bots.\n\nIn terms of errors, we had a recent issue with a pinch fault but we fixed that easily with some cleaning.  The more common error we get is repeated triggers of the cat sensors: happens every few months. If this happens while we are on vacation, a power cycle will fix it.  If were are home, we clean the sensors.  We do have the extended warranty.\n\nIn terms of our cats, when we first got the LR3s, we had 4 cats ranging in size from 12 lbs to 18 pounds and ages ranged between 9 and 13.  One of those cats had diabetes and having a camera on the LR3 was instrumental in monitoring his litter box habits; I wish we had the LR4 when he was alive so we could better watch his weight trends. All 4 of those cats started using the LR3 within a few days without issue.  When we upgraded to the LR4s, no one had an issue changing from the LR3 to the LR4.  Over the last 2 years, 2 of our cats have died and we have adopted 2 younger cats.  We adopted each younger cat at different times: 1 was 6 months and the other was about a year old.  Both of them learned to use the bots without any issues and within about a week of coming home.  \n\nIn short, the LRs have been game changers for us and we absolutely intend to buy new versions as they come out.', ""I think you have gotten plenty of advice from others, I just wanted to say 2 things.\n\n 1, as you said you do the cleaning, so really it's your call. If your husband is so against it tell him he needs to start doing the litterbox duties for a month. Depending on how many cats you have it will be a week or two before he sees your viewpoint. My husband and I have had one LR3 for our 3 cats, one of which was diabetic and had pancreatitis so he was peeing A LOT. I had to daily shake the drawer to even it out and change the bag every other day. We are trying for a family and one day I just decided that it was his sole responsibility in preparation for me not being able to handle it. Within a week he was telling me we needed a second unit.\n\n2, yes it has problems, just like with everything. And as many people say you would expect something so expensive to be built better, which I agree with. But I have zero regrets with our purchase decision. Even when our LR got stuck upside down while we were out of town and we had to have our friend come by after his shift at 4:30am on Christmas day. I still am happy with my purchase. Though I would definitely always keep a backup around in case of emergencies and for when you travel."", 'I have the LR4 and honestly…I love it. I loathed scooping the litter box prior and now I feel like I’m harding maintaining it at all. It’s not any more difficult to clean in my opinion & it comes apart fairly easy. The ONLY issue we had was a motor fault about 6-9 months after getting it - and to be fair it wasn’t LR’s fault. We bought it as soon as it released. It automatically comes with a 1 year warranty and LR sent us a new base immediately. It literally came in less than a week & in that weeks time, I was brought back to having to deal with litter without it and it only reassured me this was a good purchase. They have an additional warranty for $100 which is totally worth it in my opinion after the included warranty time is up - just in case. \nOtherwise, I know now what caused the motor fault - one of my cats (I have 3 cats using 1 LR) ripped the lining when scratching which was incredibly minor and unnoticeable and probably wouldn’t have caused an issue at all if we wouldn’t have used Pretty Litter one time. Pretty Litter is non-clumping and caused the leakage to go through the liner. So, definitely don’t advise using it in your robot. Also, LR sent us a new liner also with no questions asked.\nAt the end, best purchase ever. I will never go back.\nAll that to say: if you take care of it, it will take care of you.', ""I honestly really love my litter robot. I was a little nervous, reading the reviews myself. But I think it really depends on how it's shipped. Some people have ordered theirs, and it's came broken. So I really hope that if you do end up getting one, yours won't be broken. \n\nI would say that the annoying thing about it is, how small the litter waste box seems to be. I haven't deep cleaned it yet, so I don't know how hard it is to take apart or put back together. But I'm sure it isn't that hard. I clean the inside sometimes, when I feel it needs a quick little wipe down. \n\nSometimes I have to hit the reset button because the sensors get dirty, so if you end up getting it, make sure you wipe down the sensors every one in awhile. \n\nThe downside of it that I have noticed so far is the light. And that is because the litter robot is in my room, and so it's annoying to sleep with. But other than that, I really love it!

So, definitely have patience. \n\nAs for the bad reviews, people will always post negative stuff before they post anything positive. We love our LR4. \nGood luck', 'I got the LR4 earlier this year after waffling back and forth because of the bad reviews. At first I was only kind of satisfied with it. Not scooping was great, but I still felt like I needed to change the bag every day or so because of odor. I tried a few different litters, but nothing seemed to help. After hearing multiple people on Reddit recommend Boxiecat litter I figured I’d give that a go. GAME CHANGER. I change the bag every 3-4 days (3 cats) and there is essentially no smell, and it clumps great. I have recommended the LR4 and Boxiecat to every cat owner I know.', 'So I wanted to get LR sooner but my husband said the same thing. I finally just went ahead and bought - told my husband I was doing it and using my own paycheck. 9 months later, my husband still randomly comments on how great of a decision that was! You just have to know what you are getting into. Following this sub, reading the reviews, and still purchasing it is a good sign you will be happy. It’s a machine that needs maintenance. Our robot vacuums have required way more maintenance than LR4s (we have two)\n\nBig thing: have a back up if you are away for extended periods of time! Whether that is a manual litter box during vacation or two LRs in case one has an issue — this has saved us much of the headache I see in the negative reviews. LR Issues are easy to deal with and much less angering when there is a back up.', 'It\'s a litterbox. It doesn\'t have ""fans"" like a TV show or whatever. The people who seek out this sub are mostly doing so to complain or to seek help with some kind of problem. They are not a representative sample of the typical customer who, if happy, won\'t see any reason to spend their time looking for a sub about a litterbox.\n\nTake me, for example. I bought a Litter Robot 4 for my partner (well, for their cat) for Christmas. It worked great, especially compared to the crappy automated litterbox we replaced it with (thank goodness for Amazon\'s 30-day return policy). We did have one issue in that it kept reporting that the drawer was full even when it had just been changed. The worst case was that we had to manually cycle the litter box (which was still way better than scooping and changing litter by hand). But that\'s why I sought out this subreddit, and I immediately found helpful advice (specifically information about a firmware update and instructions about recalibrating the sensors). Since then, it\'s been working really well.\n\nMost of the posts I see here are from a small minority of people that are having trouble and/or venting their frustrations by screaming into the void that is the Internet. I would not use this sub to try to conclude whether or not most people like their Litter Robot.', ""I'm a bit late in replying, but I've been a litter robot fan girl since \\~2006ish when I got my original LR2 for my 3 cats (17lbs, 18lbs & my teensy 5lb girl), and it's is still running like a champ. I decided an upgrade was in order in 2019, and ordered the LR3, which has been a bit buggy & problematic from the start, but I still got a 2nd LR3, which is also problematic. It seems there's a fairly well known issue with the DFI & pinch connector board corroding due to the moisture/humidity it's exposed to & causes the robots to fail to cycle. From what I understand, Whiskers upgraded/updated the DFI board with an enclosure that's supposed to take care of the issue. I'm waiting for the updated DFI board to arrive & am hopeful that will put both of my LR3s back in service again. I think Whiskers went through some growing pains around the time the LR3 was released, and I hope these issues are just a fluke - would be thrilled to see my LR3s in the same light as the LR2!\n\nDespite my issues with the LR3s, I'm still a fan. I've been reminded over the  last few weeks just how much more kitty litter the LR saved - I have no idea how, the cats use the LR with the same frequency as a regular box, but with the LR & 1 cat it took 5-6 months to go through 42lbs of litter. I've gone through more than 40lbs of litter in the last month since the LR3s stopped working... Granted, I added a kitten to the family 3 weeks ago, but still. The difference is astonishing. As others have said, the LR pays for itself in litter costs alone in fairly short order, especially in multi-cat households. Plus, never having to scoop is phenomenal! Just grab the bag, tie it, replace & done. Easy. It only takes a minute to do & doesn't need to be done daily. \n\nTLDR; When it works it's fantastic. When it doesn't, it's frustrating, but can be repaired with a little time, googling and redditing (and/or warranty service). If my house burned down tomorrow, the LR would be top of my list of things to replace."", ""About a month in. Im not too crazy about the drawer full of poop sitting in the litter robot for about a week until it's full.\nThe poop never gets truly surrounded by litter, so the clumps just sit and marinade in the drawer, giving off a stench. Additionally, the smell has not only seeped into the plastic of the drawer but also the plastic of some parts in the base. So it does stink when it cycles, and im not really sure how to feel about it.\n I will do another deep clean this weekend and see if changing the bad every 2 days helps. But otherwise, it has been giving me a ton of anxiety, and I am considering returning it. \nThia sub  full of super fans (ever though they claim that only the complainers come her).

When and if you need help and LR leaves you high and dry, contest the charge.\n\nIf you experience issues within the first 90 days. Return the product. Do not RMA, wait for replacement parts or try and work through them… just return it and be done with it.\n\nWhen you inevitably need support, do not use the email system unless you like sticking splinters under your toe nails… call, tweet, or otherwise harass until you get a response.\n\nGet the extended warranty, you will soon learn that simple parts are not replaceable and once out of warranty, they’ll be expecting you repurchase the entire assembly.', 'I’ve had the LR3 for about a year and I adore it. My two cats took to it immediately and it’s so easy to maintain. I’ve only had a few minor issues over time, and all of them have stemmed from me slightly over filling the litter area. I do think maintenance cleaning is important to keeping it running smoothly - I wipe down the machine lightly every time I change the litter bag, and give it a good cleaning when I change out the litter entirely.\n\nI have a daily pet sitter when I’m out of town and I keep a backup litter box on hand for her to switch to if there’s a problem, but it’s run smoothly every time I’ve left town.\n\nThe ONLY feature I wish it had was a sitter mode - where it would text the pet sitter a “I’m full” notification, so I don’t have to deal with that reminder on vacay.\n\nTo me, it was well worth the investment!', 'I made a post last week about my experience. I am now using my third LR4 (second replacement). I vented pretty hard against Whisker in that post.\n\nHere’s the experience that you should expect—the LR4 is almost guaranteed to work out of the box, and it will be amazing once your cats are acclimated. You will go an entire week, or more, without worrying about your cats’ bathroom activities, and after a whole week or more you only need to empty the drawer. Takes 5 minutes. It’s great when paired with an automatic feeder and water fountain. Your feline friends basically become roommates.\n\nBut, owning a LR4 comes at the risk of it suddenly not working, getting stuck mid-cycle, and that situation can actually be *worse* than just scooping cat litter from an ol’ fashioned litter box because your cats won’t have anywhere to do their business (assuming there is no backup).\n\nWhisker seems to be pretty good at replacing faulty robots. If you or your spouse does not work full time, and is usually at home for most of the day, then it will surely be worth the cost—the stay-at-home person can just keep an eye on it when it starts to show signs of malfunctioning. Otherwise, I think it is still likely to be worth the cost given the assumption that your unit functions properly for a long time, or that you do not tolerate malfunctions and you get yours replaced right away when it becomes necessary.', 'I have a LR3 - not a connect one. \nI’ve had it for almost four years with two cats. \n\nHere’s how it’s honestly been going. \n\nIn terms of a daily use, it’s an absolute life saver.

A raffle of blinking lights, non working box and others, made me want to cry. But fear not as almost everything is fixable. We had a pinch sensor issue that I just decided to over pass. \n\nIf you have the patience to fix and maintain things I’d recommend it.

Once I did that it started working flawlessly again', ""I could not agree with this entire post to more. Overall i love the little robots, we started with one wifi enabled litter robot and eventually got a second after the first one started having some issues but we went with the non wifi able one because we didn't really need the notifications going directly to our phones.\n\nOn our original, we replaced pinch detect sensors at the behest of tech support even though i was sure the issue was the motherboard, so lesson learned to trust my gut. I rip it apart twice a year for a deep clean right before the winter and when the weather turns warm in thebspring, and overall it can be annoying but way less annoying than scooping litter for 4 cats."", 'This is deff a design flaw because the tiniest bit of fuzz can be on the sensor and it triggers a cycle. The only thing that really helped me was popping the kid off and grabbing the globe and just kind of firming it into place. I think it gets disrupted in transit and then that contributes to the sensor problem. It seemed to help me for the most part.', ""Is the 4 smaller than the 3?? I was considering getting a 4 in the future because the opening makes the globe look like it would be more accommodating for larger cats, and since my kitten is already 8lbs at 5months, fairly certain he's going to be a big boy. I know he'll be fine in the 3, since I had 2 big boys (17 & 18lbs) who used a LR2 for years without an issue, but again the 4 looks so much more accommodating for the big guys - Would love to know how it isn't!"", ""It'll physically work for any number of cats. It may not support making 5 animal profiles in the app (I only have 3, so haven't tried). Along with that when they eventually add the weight/naming thing in the app it probably won't be helpful (I suspect it won't be helpful for cats with close weights anyway). \n\nBut physically, there's no reason it shouldn't work for 5 cats. It'll just be a bit more work to keep it full of litter and emptying the catch pan."", ""Sure! I've had issues with it since I got it. There is a sensor at the top front of the machine that is meant to detect a cat and stop the machine from cycling so they don't get hurt. Anything can set off the sensor, even the tiniest bit of fuzz or hair. \n\nMy biggest problem overall is the smell though. I clean the machine diligently and multiple times a week and it hasn't helped. I've tried so many types of litter and taken the machine apart to clean in case there are clumps stuck somewhere between the globe and shell (I've read this can happen), and the smell will not go away. The waste drawer is  also exposed to the air every time the machine cycles. If the sensor is repeatedly being triggered, the machine will keep cycling and then the waste basket is exposed to the air. \n\nI've had to put the machine in sleep mode when I'm not home because if it begins cycling and gets stuck with the waste drawer exposed, my cat can't use it. It's turned into such a headache and in the end has been way more stressful. I was previously using a basic hooded litter box and the litter genie and wish I had stuck with that. \n\nThe machine is also BIG. I didn't realize how big it would be and I had taken measurements etc. The front is very wide and open so the cat has 0 privacy. And there's no guard from smell. I could see how this would be beneficial if you were in a bigger space than I am (an apartment) and could put the robot in the basement or another room and then have a second litter box in case it isn't working but for a smaller space it's just not worth it."", 'I found it to be harder for my 16lb guy to maneuver in.

He uses the 3 almost exclusively.\nEdit to clarify- we had a time when we only had 2 cats and just used the 4- that’s when he hung his butt out the front.

It you are the soul that wants everything spotless, then you’ll be cleaning daily — which offers virtually no advantage over a “manual” box. However if you want freedom and prefer to just dust it off once a week, then you’ll be happy. As for me, I do what it takes to keep it running reliably. Once a week I use an electric duster to blow off the sensors (LR 4 oniy), and change the waste bag and add litter. I wipe down the whole outside of the unit once a month (or so. (Usually “so”.)). A total disassembly/deep clean is never a bad thing, but not really necessary more than once a year, but again, it all depends on your personal preferences. There are those that wash and wax and vacuum their car weekly, and those that do it monthly, those that do it yearly, you get the picture. The bottom line, is that the LR’s are time tested and reliable. An extremely successful company has been built on that principle.', 'I went ahead & put in order for the LR clay litter.

"['I’ve only had the LR4 and the LR3 connect. Personally I think the LR4 has a better design when it comes to daily use considerations and the increased price is worth it.

It pops open all the time. I thought I was doing something wrong, but after watching multiple videos it seems like that’s just the actual design of the thing.

"[""Best thing to do in this situation is to dismantle the globe to find the exact intrusion point of the urine. If you haven't already pull the beauty plugs out from the front of the globe, they will be on the bottom section or liner side of the globe then follow the back both sides till all eight (8) screws are removed. gently separate the globe halves and carefully pull the liner out of the groves and inspect where the urine is coming from.\n\nThe globe is designed to overlap the liner when assembled so urine can't breech the area the globe is mated together. So either you do have a breech in the liner or the globe is letting in urine from a different location. But as I said the urine trail should tell you exactly where its coming from.\n\nIf you wish to completely disassemble the globe you will have to carefully remove at least one side of some sealing foam on the edge, you'll see what i mean, and also mark the correct position of two globe position magnets that are polarity specific when you separate the globe quarters in the rack gear area. my advice is to carefully pull and mark the position of the magnets as you carefully separate the globe quarters. If the magnet(s) are installed incorrectly on assembly, you will get either a dump, home or both home and dump position errors, simply flip the magnets and it should be good.""]"

"['After doing several teardown and rebuilds to deep clean and one actual weight sensor replacement I figured out how they are calibrated!\n\nFirst off when dealing with a pressure sensitive variable resistor you need to have a clean surface for it to adhere to, this means  when the adhesive is used to maintain position of the sensor there MUST NOT be any debris causing an uneven surface to apply pressure on.\n\nAfter that is established assemble the weight foot and pressure plate with the little rubber baby buggy bumper against the weight sensor, fasten the nut on the weight foot bolt. While applying pressure to the pressure plate bottoming out the weight spring fasten the nut all the way till the nut bottoms out on the threads, then loosen 3 whole turns and gently let up on the spring tension. This will get you ""roughed"" in.\n\nNow for the actual physical calibration of the sensor, try not to apply artificial weight to the base unit or just separate the bottom half of the LR and have it on your work space with nothing else attached. Next you will need to connect your VOM to the sensor leads. The goal is to achieve the lowest ohm reading possible. You should see a minimum reading anywhere between or around the range of 400 to 600 OHMs as each sensor will read different for its lowest OHM reading. Next loosen the nut a half turn and observe the ohm reading, depending on the direction of the ohm reading either tighten or loosen as needed. The goal is to achieve the lowest reading you can get each time you turn the nut press lightly on the base to engage the spring and release to let it resettle, you will notice a slight change in the reading, adjust accordingly to get the lowest reading possible. Once you have the lowest reading you can get, and with no weight present then tighten the nut one full turn, what this will do is slightly desensitize the sensor so it does not trigger a cat intrusion on cycle due to the vibrations of the globe / changes in litter position etc. If the sensor is TOO sensitive this WILL happen. Once you have finished reassembling everything, next is to ""soft recalibrate"" the control board so it has a NEW baseline to function off of.\n\nAt this point reassemble completely the LR, power up the unit and let it do it\'s self checks and globe cycle, let it get to the ready state, (solid blue light).\n\nTo soft calibrate, make certain you have an EMPTY waste drawer and globe,  but if you don\'t want to empty the globe, I found you can just remove the globe and put the bonnet back on and this works just as well.\n\nNext, with the blue ready light illuminated solid, and without touching anything on the base with the exception of the control buttons press and HOLD the EMPTY and RESET buttons, (usually 5 to 6 seconds) till you see the RED light flash fast, then let go and the red flashing light should stop and the blue ready light should illuminate solid once again. If the blue light doesn\'t illuminate just press the reset button and it will.\n\nReinstall the globe if you had it removed, power cycle the LR once again and then test the weight sensitivity of the LR, it should be back to the expected proper function.\n\nYou can also at this point if the sensor is still too sensitive or isn\'t sensitive enough readjust the nut a turn or so either way but I found this rarely is needed.\n\nFor reference the weight sensor when installed and read the lowest you can calibrate it to, (400 to 600 ohms is healthy) anything higher is drifting out of spec. When the sensor is set to it lowest ohm value, loosening can, (but rarely does, unless its slightly out of spec) make it slightly sensitive and tightening desensitizes it.\n\nWhen pressure is being applied the clamping force on the sensor is lessening, the ohms will rise up around 1.5 to 1.7 K ohms before going out of limits to an open state.\n\nHope this helps you out?!', ""This is extremely helpful, thank you! The main thing is probably the reset procedure, I'm using sensors from Digikey at the moment and they should work fine (and did for a minute) but as I detailed the thing started acting up again which just frustrated the living daylights out of me b/c I'm so tired of taking it apart with the blinking!  \n\n\nLike I'm not even exaggerating here, the LR2 units I have are possibly as much as 10 years old and STILL WORKING GREAT without ever needing a new power supply or a motor or switch or anything.

Use a dielectric grease the encase the contact points on the pinch detect contacts, keep the gearbox lubed with a general purpose light grease. and once a week do a quick wipe of the bonnet and base electrical connections that take less than 20 seconds to do. and occasionally when I see the need, I recalibrate the weight sensors.\n\nTrying to get the R&D department to improve the product will be next to impossible when the bean counters in the accounting department are constantly forcing them to design something on the ultra cheap, the bean counters always win when it comes to the bottom line...""]"

The nut used to fasten and calibrate the weight sensor is located under the waste drawer, pull the waste drawer out and you will see it inside on the bottom back of the base unit on top of a metal plate. Rotate the nut counter clockwise, (loosen) 1 full turn.\n\nNext take your bonnet and globe off the base unit, place the bonnet back on only, empty and place the waste drawer back in.\n\nWith your LR in the ready state (blue light) and without touching the LR with the exception of the control panel buttons press and hold BOTH the EMPTY and RESET buttons till you see the red light flash fast (usually about 5 seconds), once you see the fast flashing red light let go of the buttons and the light should return to a blue light only, if it doesn't just press reset and it will.\n\nRemove the bonnet and place the globe and bonnet back on, power cycle the LR, (unplug the power from the back of the base unit and back in) let it cycle and when ready then see if kitty triggers the cat timer?\n\nIf it still does not trigger you will need a replacement weight sensor.

Then I just let it sit outside in the sun for a bit to dry it out/germicide it, I'll rotate it around a few times since the excess water will pool in a few places. Wipe down the base with a general surface cleaner. I'll probably add waxing the track the globe rotates in to that.

"[""If you have a slow flashing yellow light (on and off once a second) either on power up or when in the process of cycling, This is an indication of the bonnet not making a proper connection or there's an internal fault with the bonnet electronics. Judging by your description the LR3 has not cycled at all out of the box, so lets go with that symptom and troubleshoot.\n\nHere's a few simple thing you can do to quickly narrow down the issue;\n\nStep #1. Is the blue night light on when the LR is powered up?, (you should see 3 blue lights), If you are in a well lit area place your finger over the little circle at the 8 o clock position of the POWER button on the base unit. If there still is no illumination skip to step #3\n\nStep #2.  You see 3 blue lights, try turning the night light feature off (press and hold the POWER button for 5 seconds). Power cycle the unit, does the globe now rotate?\n\nStep #3. You don't see any blue lights, And you have already checked the electrical connection at the left rear of the bonnet and base to be clean and touching, If so?, go to step #4\n\nStep #4. Take the bonnet off only, on the base you will see the 2 metal contact points the bonnet make an electrical connection to. Find anything that is bare metal that will be able to connect BOTH the metal contact on the base together to make an electrical connection, make certain it remains connected for the test, (this will simulate the bonnet connection and will get the LR3 past the self checks on startup if nothing is wrong with the base unit.) Does the globe start moving? If yes?, go to step #5, if no?,  go to step #6.\n\nStep #5. the globe moves with the metal contacts shorted together, you either have a defective bonnet, or the polarity is reversed on the base contacts. go to step #7\n\nStep #6. If you have no change in operation with or without the base's bonnet contacts being shorted together as described in step #4,  there could be a physical wiring issue. go to step #7.\n\nStep #7.  pull the globe and waste drawer off and out of the base unit.  With a flashlight in hand you will see a small cavity on the left side of the base units waste drawer opening, look in an upward in the cavity, you should see a twisted Black and Purple wire going to the contacts on the top of the base unit, these are the wires that feed the power (+5 volts DC) to the bonnet. (SEE PIC BELOW!) Do any of the 2 wires look like they are loose and not connected to anything?. If NO, is the BLACK wire closer to you than the PURPLE wire? (You should see the black wire closest to you and the purple wire towards the rear of the base unit). If it appears connected there's either a wiring issue or the control board is malfunctioning and you will need to warranty the unit. If any of the 2 wires are disconnected or in reverse order this is your issue. GO to step #8\n\nStep #8.  If its a wiring issue you can with a #2 Philips screwdriver with at least a 6 inch long shank, unfasten the 9 screws on the bottom of the base unit and gain access to the connectors to correct. Reassemble and test.

"[""1. There is space for them to put their paws on the lip of the globe if you don't use the included fence, but I think most here would recommend grabbing one of the PetSafe stairs on Amazon. These fit nicely over the LR4 step and give plenty of extra space to perch on if that's your kitties' preference.\n\n2. One of mine has regular poo problems and just got over a spat. Not to be totally nasty, but he had poos the consistency of soft serve, roughly. The LR4 with Dr Elsey's Ultra handled them okay, but saying it was mess free would be a lie. There would be streaks on the grate and leading into the poop chute. They cleaned up easy enough and I just kept wiping it down regularly with cleaner and a paper towel so that it didn't get outright nasty. The poo would also break up at times and get clumps stuck to and in the grate as well as on the side of the liner because Gandalf is a jerk and does his business down the side instead of in the litter bed. If yours do this, keep a manual scoop around and use it to scrape any mess into the litter bed. This will get filtered out next cycle and can help keep things clean enough to avoid too frequent deep cleans.\n\n3. I originally used a single LR4 for 5 cats. I had to empty it daily, but it mostly worked. The wrinkle was our senior cat who had kidney disease and wouldn't wait. I added a manual box as backup for him if the LR4 was cycling when he had to go. He recently passed away so I'm letting the manual box get dirty in preparation to take it away. All of the cats use the LR4, but our chonky boi definitely prefers the manual box so I'm giving him some transition time. I now empty the LR4 every 3 days or so. I expect I'll be back to every other day when all 4 are using just the LR4. The remaining 4 did not have any problems when I wasn't using the spare box. If it was cycling they'd just wait for it to finish so I'm hoping it'll be an easy transition.\n\n4. The general rule is to mix litters, gradually adding more of the new and less old, to help your cats transition. In reality, it probably depends on the cats. I tried crystal litter with mine for a while as I was hoping for less dust and less tracking. I didn't mix at all. Just swapped them from clay one day and all of the 6-at-the-time cats kept peeing where they were meant to no prob. This was when I had solely manual boxes. If you're worried, I hear that the LR4 works with crystal litter, it just needs granules that will fit through the filter so it doesn't just dump it. You may have a rough go with the loose stools as it will definitely smear without being well-coated, but maybe mixing in a bit of clay will make it tolerable for that transition period.\n\n5. For the loose stools, I'd strongly recommend some Rocco and Roxie's litter deodorizer. It won't help with the mess and smells weirdly like cinnamon gum, but a sprinkle in the waste drawer and on the litter bed when topping up does a great job of combating the stank when Gandalf is having an episode. Assuming yours also make some extra stinkies, it should make the wait between poo and cycle a bit more tolerable. Plus it helps with odor escaping the drawer while the waste port is over the bin."", 'My guy has loose stools too- IBD, they say. Your experience and advice is helpful.

I'm new to litter robot it's on its way to me this week I'm just trying to learn as much as possible about them"", ""The pinch detect switch is the one you are referring to. I've utilized a very simple workaround that works perfectly to maintain the safety feature and not have it become intermittent due to moisture and debris causing it to fail. Just remove the bottom of the LR and go to the pinch detect switch, clean if needed, apply a generous glob of petroleum jelly to the contact points of the pinch detect switch. Make certain its completely encased (see pic below), once this is done, it will still function as normal but maintain a pristine electrical connection and prevent moisture and litter debris from intruding. Yes it will eventually collect a bunch of debris but it will stay on the outside of the glob and doesn't harm the connection inside. I've done this to all three of my LR3's and there hasn't been a single pinch detect error in over a year of utilizing this method! I've only seen maybe one or two actual safety bar detected messages occur, and it was one of the kitties actually getting too curious and getting a paw in the way while it was cycling back to the home position!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v01thv7036wa1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5411497fa5a39e5b591ded1bb0890f763c18540b\n\nThe other thing is to make certain your older DFI Emitter board is not suffering from moisture intrusion on the I/O chip pins and corroding. The new replacement DFI's address this issue, but the older DFI's can be repaired and resealed properly and they will last a long time, all of mine, I re-soldered and resealed with a clear coat and aside from an actual IC failure in one DFI, (I replaced one of the I/O chips) they have been working as intended and flawlessly!\n\nDoing the usual wipe down, cleanup and wiping of the bonnet connections on both the bonnet and base unit an occasional gearbox re-lube, that's pretty much it for the tips. Quite straight forward and simple!\n\nHope this helps?\n\nJust curious?, the unit that isn't working, what are it's failure symptoms?"", ""Can you describe your gear lube process? Some friends just got a LR3 and its MUCH quieter than my old one. I'm wondering if some lube may help."", ""I found every motor/gearbox has a different noise level. The reason being is the gear lash setting, (the distance between the drive gear on the motor output and the first reduction gear) The setting its self is crude and sloppy as there's a bit of play to work with between the mounting plate the motor fastens to and the gear reduction case the metal plate the motor is attached to fastens on to. Having a small 12 volt battery to power the motor while you work on the gear lash setting on a work surface is best to find the sweet spot noise wise and tighten things up.  You will notice one direction the motor travels in will always be a wee bit noisier than the other direction, its just the way it is!\n\nBut in any event you can get a general purpose grease and coat all the gears and the shafts they rotate on after cleaning the gears off of the old grease and any debris that might of got caught on the gears causing a taping sound while in use, (this is common to happen). Do NOT heavily pack the gear box with grease as this will cause excessive drag in the gear box and cause over torque faults! Instead just dip each gear in grease enough to coat it and the shafts, reinstall back in the gear box. \n\nTo access the gear box you need a 2.5mm Allen wrench to loosen the set screw on the black pinion gear to remove it off the output shaft, and a #2 Philips screwdriver to remove the 4 screws holding the gear box case halves together. Once the case halves are apart you will have full access to the gears, They install in a certain order and there is a small shaft collar or spacer on the third reduction gear shaft so don't loose that!!!

"['First question... What errors is it giving you? When it stops, the blinking lights actually mean things. Chances are, you have some of the more simple errors rather than the more complicated failures.   \n\n\nWith a total of NINE of the LR3 or connect models, 2 of which live in my RV full time and have put up with my 20 rescues using them non-stop (I have to replace the bag in each daily, b/c they don\'t have any other hobbies!)... These things are definitely being stress tested.   \n\n\nI will be the FIRST to say that they are over-designed and under-tested on their electronics, and the LR2 was much better about ""just working"". Things like the design of the weight sensor instead of a simple trigger switch - yeah, that wasn\'t an improvement. The nightlight or that stupid bonnet thing. ALSO not an improvement. The pinch connectors - this was a continuation of a bad design from the LR2, but at least it can be bypassed. But the king: That damned drawer-failure-board. What a TERRIBLE design.  \n\n\nStart with a fresh power supply that is rated for 15v and TWO amps (because it will use up to that) b/c the Chinesium power supplies don\'t last forever, and voltage drops when the motor is running - which can make the circuits do unpredictable things. So start with good power. These are cheap enough to always have at least one extra laying around.  \n\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09M6YSH13/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o08\\_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09M6YSH13/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)\n\nThey have their error code page on the website, but here\'s the main cheat sheet and a couple of additions since they have TWO MORE BLOODY CODES that not even the phone support know how to diagnose!  \nFlashing blue: Too much in the drawer. That one is easy.  \nFlashing red: There is a problem with the weight sensor / resistance is out of range / it won\'t reset. This can be bypassed but it isn\'t too expensive to replace.  \nFlashing Yellow: Here\'s where things get stupid. There are THREE reasons for this one: FAST flashing yellow is the pinch connector losing contact. SLOW yellow.... Can be EITHER the stupid bonnet connector lost electrical contact for a nanosecond (see about cleaning / bending the contacts) OR something stepped on the thing and the weight sensor registered the contact. This can ALSO be when the weight sensor is failing. Try bypassing the weight sensor first for testing.  \nNow the best one: FAST blue! Oh, that\'s not in the chart? Yeah.... I know. It\'s because what they will tell you is that ANY blue flashing means the drawer is full. NO IT DOES NOT. FAST blue means that the stupid DFI has FAILED ENTIRELY or their magical chip system is sending garbage that the blinky lights don\'t understand. There is NO WAY that I have found to bypass this stupid DFI yet. At least replacing it isn\'t too hard.  \n\n\nTo bypass the pinch contacts: Easy - unplug the pink connectors, and connect them together with a suitable piece of NOT ALUMINUM. Aluminum corrodes in the presence of ammonia. Guess what\'s in cat urine, in MASSIVE amounts! Brilliant design choice, Robots.   \n\n\nTo bypass the weight sensor: A little more complicated. Unplug the thing at the back of the compartment, and use a small amount of stranded copper wire twisted and bent in half to fit into the connector - why wire? This will add some resistance to the circuit and keep the system happy. Obviously it will not detect cat use, but that\'s OK... You can set it up with a smart plug or simple timer to run the thing every few hours, and that will be sufficient for the moment. Or forever, your choice.  \n\n\nBut even if you think that weight sensor is the only issue... It could STILL be the DFI because apparently that stupid thing can trigger OTHER errors when it is failing. I bypassed that on several of mine by pulling them out and (after covering in clear tape) taping the two boards together facing each other, and the taping it OUTSIDE the robot up on the bonnet. I\'m replacing the boards anyway, but this HAS worked to get two of them back running again from the hyper-blue-flashing.

The only problem with this is that it's not enough time for the pee to be thoroughly absorbed by the litter because she, nor my male cat, will cover their urine.

The only other thing that someone else recommended to me was  if the robot is inside of a room with a door....to put a microchip pet door in that room's door so that only the 1 cat can use it. \nI haven't done that as she will use 2 of the robots on the main floor. 1 in an office room, but the other is in the dining room. Not ideal, but we only use the dining room 3x a year. I didn't want to put both of them in the office because of tension between 2 of my girl cats. I needed somewhere where there would be no confrontations. The office is at the end of a hallway. So a bottleneck situation could occur. So far, it's working. I had 3 cats with 2 robots. I now have 3 cats and 4 robots. 2 upstairs, which hardly ever gets used, and 2 downstairs. They've all gravitated to the dining room one for some reason. \nWhat I really need is a robot that will toss some litter on top of the pee for my cats lol.

When I'd finally had enough of her peeing outside of the robots, I put her upstairs with 2 robota for 2 months. I weaned her off the Prozac (since it wasn't working anyway) and I visited her 3x a day for play and petting etc. I had cameras on her robots so I could hopefully figure out why she sometimes peed outside the box. She was perfect the entire 2 months. Only 1x did she attempt to pee outside the box and that was when it had not rotated after she had peed and then 5 minutes later, she needed to poop. Instead of going to the other robot, she was going to pee on the robot steps, but I saw her and yelled at her. I hate that I yelled at her, but it was an automatic response. She didn't pee on the steps though. I manually rotated the robot. And a few minutes later, she went and used it again. After 2 months, I let her downstairs for short periods of time. That was a month ago and she's done great. However, she peed on the floor in front of the robot a few days ago because my other cat had peed in it and it hadn't rotated yet. I had it set on 15 minutes to help the litter absorb the pee of my non covering cats. She literally stuck her head in, came out and then peed on the floor. So now it's on 3 minutes. Sucks.

Seems it's known and will probably be fixed in a future firmware update, per the rep I spoke with a while back, but who knows when that will land. Sounds like wait and see territory.\n\nThat said, if it's a significant issue for you, you might try asking to have the firmware rolled back. For me, the improved cat detection is worth the weight issues, but I understand they will roll back firmware if you ask.""]"
"[""To reset the LR4 after emptying the drawer, you need to press (not hold) the reset button. If you have a cat detect or error to clear (such as when you topped up litter), you'll need to press it twice. If you see the LED panel flash white briefly after you press reset, you're good to go.\n\nNow with that said, resetting **will not** reset the waste level for the LR4. What it does is reset the weight to account for the X lbs of waste you've removed and ensure the next cat to use it is weighed properly. The LR4 checks the drawer levels each cycle so even if you reset it, it won't update the drawer full status until it cycles. I'll generally run a manual cycle after emptying it as that will reset the drawer levels, level out the new litter I added, and mix in the deodorizer I've sprinkled on. \n\nIf you're having trouble with inaccurate drawer levels, make sure you're on a recent enough firmware, and recalibrate the DFI lasers: https://www.litter-robot.com/manual_pdf/LR4_Recalibrating_DFI-Lasers-EN.pdf""]"

I could not find anything about it updating and the single flashing white light not showing up at all so I figured it wasn\'t updating and moved to the next steps.

This will take the drive motor out of the circuit. Power the LR up once again, Do you get a slow flashing blue light?\n\nIf there's no change it could be your control board is faulty.\n\n\\#3 If you get a blue flashing light then we will verify the rest of the LR components by plugging in the the sensor connector (8 pin connector), power up once again.

"[""Interesting you are getting the same dump position error with the new base. This tells me that the new base probably is not the issue but your globe. The globe has 2 ceramic magnets placed in two different locations with opposing polarities to differentiate between which is dump and which is the home positions. If you look at the rack gear that encompasses your globe you will see there are 4 pockets in the gear teeth, 2 of those pockets will have magnets in them, the other 2 will not. You can locate the magnets if you have a magnet handy (stronger the magnet the better!) and put it over the locations mentioned, it will either attract or repel the magnet you are using to test with. Find the magnet that is closest in location to the globe's dump port, stick the magnet to it and let it stay stuck to it for a few minutes, if your dump position magnet is weakened this will strengthen its magnetic field. While doing this clean the exterior of the globe of any and all debris and dust. after your finished with the wipe down make certain the base doesn't have anything collected on the top of it where the globe interfaces with. Pull the magnet off of the globe, replace the globe on the base making certain the black key at the rear of the globe is properly in the slot on the base, (failure to properly locate the black key will cause dump position faults!), Clean your bonnet electrical contacts, install on the base and test. Does this solve the dump position faults? If the globe is lifted even in the slightest while the magnets are over the hall effect sensors on the base its sensitive enough to no register the magnetic field so it vitally important to have both the globe and base free of most of the debris so the globe doesn't get lifted while rotating.\n\nIn rare instances I've had the drive motors cause dump position faults and even over torque errors. But to have the separate bases give the same error suggests its not likely the base causing the issue but something that hasn't been replaced or tested yet.\n\nJust a side note; your new open air base might not have the 4th connector on the control board populated for your connect daughter card unless you specified when purchasing?\n\nHope this helps?""]"

Have had the LR3s for about 2 years.', 'I bought another 3 even when the 4 was out, purely for the cost, first one was great so why bother paying extra.', 'I have one cat who does NOT tolerate change of any kind. I’ve had the LR3 for two years now and she refuses to use it. I’ve tried attractants, sitting next to it with her, having the auto cycling turned off - nothing. She just won’t use it. I’ve had to have a litter maid set up specifically for her, and that’s been a nightmare because with no way to section it away from the other cats, it fills up daily. I’ve hated the look of the LR3 since before I bought it, but who cares? It’s a litter box. Despite wanting a second one for my downstairs, I haven’t been willing to spend the extra $$ for the LR4 when I could get a second LR3 for $200 on Offerup (plus then they would match and my OCD would stay at peace). That is, until one night when I saw an ad for the LR4 and it occurred to me that the entry for it is SO MUCH MORE OPEN. Maybe it would be less intimidating and more within her open top comfort range. We bought one right then and there with the deal that we’d send it back if I couldn’t get her to use it. Well, she’s been using it consistently with no problems for the past two weeks.\n\nSo I suppose what I’m trying to say is that if you have a cat who is particularly skittish and/or sensitive to change/reluctant to use anything that isn’t an open top - go with the LR4. I love both robots, but both have small annoyances and small improvements over the other. The waste drawer design on the LR4 thrills me every day I look at it, but the design of the liner in the LR3 seems to work a little better comparatively. Somehow my cats have managed to miss the LR4 and some pee drained into the inside of the step which was gross, but the liner on the LR3 comes unhooked from the entrance all the time so you have to massage and work it back into place which can also be gross.

"[""I've done that a few times with the plastic shields, works like a charm!\n\nAll three of my Emitter boards of the DFI set had the corrosion issue. The detector boards as a rule don't have issues but wouldn't hurt to inspect. I repaired them by re-soldering the chip pins an haven't had an issue since!\n\nIf you have the skill to solder SMT parts, just apply flux paste and apply heat to the pins with a solder pencil, the clear coating will burn away quickly as it NOT a conformal coating that requires a fiberglass pen to remove, but rather a low temperature clear coat.  If needed use the fiberglass pen on any corroded chip pins to clear as much corrosion off prior to reflowing. Just remember you will need extra solder whether you have some high silver content solder or some 60/40 or equivalent rosin core solder because of the tarnishing and or corrosion if present will reduce the amount of usable existing solder. I also highly suggest reflowing pins 1 through 10 on the I/O chip this is always the suspect area of damage. The other side rarely needs reflowing with my experience. Once finished with the reflowing clean all the flux off /degrease, inspect your work for any gapped solder joints and apply a generous coat or 2 of clear coat to seal of the worked area. \n\nAfter the clearcoat is dry enough it should barring any unforeseen issues work perfectly as this is a permanent fix!.\n\nAnother neat tip since you are in the neighborhood, if you haven't already is to clean the pinch detect contacts, use a dielectric grease or petroleum jelly to completely encapsulate the contact points of the pinch detect switch. This will assure there's no possibility of moisture or debris intrusion. Yes the glob will collect debris over time  but it will be on the outside and not affecting the contact points in the inside!!!  I've done this to all three of my LR3's and I never have an issue with a false pinch detect in well over a year!"", 'AWESOME!, if you see my previous post here I also have a reliable workaround for the pinch detect contact points!.', 'The clear coat is similar to an automotive clear coat, so yeah,, but i found a nail polish clear coat works just as well at a fraction of the cost.\nLearning how to solder with SMT (surface mount technology) is the equivalent of diving in with both feet first! My best advice is heat control and flux is your friend! There are plenty of tutorials on how to solder on line that will help you learn quickly and what tools you will need to do the repairs, luckily its relatively inexpensive. You can use a standard rosin core solder with this repair along with flux paste to avoid closing the gap between the individual pins. And clean up as much of the corrosion as possible prior to performing the actual soldering, this will make the repair all that much easier.\n\nHope this helps?']"

If you have the older DFI board set and since its a year old its a given it does, it right around that timeframe for the moisture intrusion to cause corrosion on the I/O chip pins. If by chance the chip pins are still silver shiny, you need to chemically clean using some IPA or equivalent, apply another coating or two of clear coat to the chip, this will assure there will be no intrusion of moisture as a good chunk of the DFI boards out there of that version have insufficient clear coat protection. If there's corrosion present, clean it off the best you can and then apply the clear coat to stop any further corrosion. You can use a clear nail polish and it will be more than sufficient to protect the DFI.

I’m not saying that lightly it really made a significant difference.', ""They all tend to split up in the house (4 in one room,  5 in the other, and the rest in the living room).  The cats sleep and wake in shifts so you don't see all 15 awake and active at the same time so it does naturally work out.  I also have a routine everyday to feed and clean the house (having 3 LR's does help out a lot!) so my house does not smell like a large litter box.""]"

"[""Love mine.  3 years and going with the LR3 and minimal issues.  All issues resolved by customer care in a timely manner under my warranty.  I have 3 cats and not scooping is the best thing ever.  Especially for when I'm away.  My cat sitter loves it too.\n\nI rarely disassemble and clean the whole unit.  I wipe the sensors down and vacuum out any litter under the bonnet from time to time, and wipe the unit down with a wet rag to get rid of the dust."", ""I am not sure if there is a better one out there, but my experience with the LR4 has been less enjoyable than with the LR3.  The LR4 is much quieter than the LR3 which means both cats will use it now since one was terrified of the LR3, but the LR3 was largely more reliable than the LR4 has been.  The LR4 can be frustrating to troubleshoot, the app is often unhelpful (Whisker, please just put the KB in the app instead of making me find the PDF to decipher error codes), and it will often have connectivity issues.  My biggest gripe, though, is the capacity of the bin.  With two cats we are emptying it multiple times a week.  I am not sure if this is a function of the actual volume of the bin, or how the sensors read waste levels.  The lower gate also doesn't contain waste as well as the LR3, but I hear a replacement part is on the way to address that.\n\nIn terms of value, I can only measure how much time it is saving us over a traditional litter box, and right now, that isn't much if any.  I cannot measure things like odor containment which it does do well (provided it has captured all the urine) or keeping the dog out but emptying the LR4 and scooping a traditional box take just about the same amount of time, and they are needing it about as often.  The LR4 has also required a significant amount of troubleshooting time, which is not a requirement for a traditional box.\n\nI think much of this can be addressed with firmware updates, but it would be nice to see a base with greater capacity, or one with a hole in the bottom so you could place it over a larger container.  I have been thinking about designing my own and taking a Dremel to our existing one, but I would wait to do that until the warranty expires.  Looking forward to patches over the next 9 months to address these issues."", 'I bought my LR3 refurbished direct from Whisker. I\'d say it probably wasn\'t worth the high price - I paid \\~$550 (with extended warranty). \n\nBUT, it depends on your needs and expectations. As far as no longer scooping daily, yeah it\'s great. No more scooping. \n\nHowever, if you are mainly concerned about odor control,  I\'d say temper your expectations. There\'s definitely a need to frequently deep clean the globe and tray in order to control odor. I\'ve also spent quite a bit of time (and money) concocting a DIY solution to extending the ""no smell"" timeframe between emptying the bin. Carbon filters, odor neutralizers, humidity control, different types of litter, etc.', 'It’s probably the best one on the market, but it’s still terrible. Some people are lucky enough not to have issues but a lot of people do. Reading this sub, and based on the statistics of people who bother with subreddits/reviews, I’d guess you have a 60-70% chance of getting a good one. If you’re unlucky like the rest of us, though, you’ll spend far more time dealing with technical issues and the globe sticking in an unusable position, resulting in no place for your cat to go, than you ever spent scooping. I’d go back to our old setup in a heartbeat but I’m just hoping future firmware updates help make sense of the nearly $1k investment we have in this thing.  \n\nAlso, this thing takes up a ton of space so be prepared for that.', 'So I have a LR1 that I\'ve had since 2011 and an LR4 that I bought last year. I also have 1 traditional box in my bed room as my older kitty gets shut in with us at night while my young kitties do not.\n\nI would say the answer is: yes assuming you have that kind of disposable income. My LR1 is still working. In some ways it works better than the 4. We\'ve had to replace the panel on it once, and probably should again as the sensor really only registers if we give it a good shove, it no longer acknowledges cats, but it\'s put in a lot of good years.\n\nThe LR4 is finicky. I went with the 4 over the 3 because it claimed it would track usage of individual cats. It doesn\'t. It signifies by weight alone and my smaller 2 are too close in size for that to be helpful. The app is clunky and largely useless. User support should be a primary function, but is absent. Even ordering via app is clunky, and a company should really question it\'s choices when the UX for spending more money isn\'t simple and intuitive.. It requires a hard flat surface underneath. I can\'t use it in my carpeted bedroom, and I can\'t put it on a litter mat to cut down on litter spread. So now I have to sweep daily or constantly shove the mat back in place. It faults out regularly. Reading above I\'ll count myself lucky in that it usually faults out with the litter in place. I don\'t deep clean any of the boxes more or less frequently than the others. Every month or 2 a full dump and scrub is called for. I don\'t think you\'ll ever get around that. I feel they over promised and under delivered which is disappointing in a $700 litter box. When it\'s working correctly it is helpful. If I had to do it over again I\'d save some cash and go with the 3 as all of the ""upgrades"" between the two seem to largely be unhelpful or actively detrimental. \n\nOverall if the 4 was my only experience I wouldn\'t encourage you to buy in. However I love the original so much that I have hope they will be fixing their stuff so that I love the 4 eventually.', 'TLDR: Absolutely worth it for our home!  I have 2 LR3 for 2 years.  The way our schedule is, I gladly pay for the convenience. \n\nI started with 1 LR knowing I have no qualms to sending something back in the time frame. I had 4 cats, one who was blind, one 3legged-1 eyed cat who’s missing leg is a front one (not good at covering deposits due to this), and 2 “normalish” other cats.  They all took to it well, surprisingly. Had to empty the drawer about every 2-3 days. Realized how amazing it was with odor control and no scooping twice daily, I ordered a second LR. \n\nThen we found a kitten at a gas station. He took to it with no issues.  He’s now 19 pounds and fits still, but I do notice he pees on the front edge of the litter, but it still empties in the bin fine. \n\nSince then my 19 y/o blind cat died and we adopted a “terminal” older cat (heart worms).  When we first brought her home, we didn’t know the terminal part, just that she had been at the shelter, was at a foster with nervous issues and needed a good home because she was “special”.  Oddly enough, she figured out the LR just fine. \n\nSo total of 5 adult cats. 2 LR. I empty  the bins every 4ish days. I’ve bought my friend’s LR but haven’t picked it up yet because it didn’t work out for his cat (I’m not sure why, but I had talked the LR up and don’t mind having another). Plus we have the room for it. \n\nOne of the best things this has allowed is for us to take trips without worrying about the litter boxes.  This is HUGE because we hate asking someone to come empty them.  Of course the app lets me know it’s working and I put a camera in the room to keep an eye on them also. \n\nI’ve changed litter a few times to find what is best for us (fresh step right now). When I tried the boxy brand, I had so many issues with it malfunctioning. \n\nI do disassemble it and take the ball of it outside and hose and soapy water it clean at least twice a year and wipe it down with baby wipes in between (convenience again). \n\nThe worst problem I’ve had, I spoke about above.  I’m sure it was some kind of sensor issue, but it resolved. \n\nI’ve often said that if my LR breaks, I would treat the situation as I would if my clothes dryer quit.  I would buy another.  No question.  \n\nSide note: last week our area was hit hard by tornado and although we were unscathed, we had no power from Fri-wed night. Scooping daily, I realized again how much I love the convenience of automatic litter box. Plus I realized how much wasted litter with scooping each time.  \n\nSorry for the novel, and I hope that somewhat answers your question for my opinion.', ""We have had ours for just over a year. After a year, pinch detect kept going off, said it was full when it wasn't, etc. I replaced the dfi sensor and bypassed the pinch detect,  recalibrate the sensor, etc. I've spent too many hours over the weekends trying to figure out how to get it to work reliably again to no avail. It worked great for a year though and my husband really appreciated the low oder aspect. One year isn't enough to warrant the price for me. I'm here looking for alternatives. Otherwise I will get a litter box credenza with a hooded litter box inside and just manually clean it. More reliable and less effort since I don't have to spend hours and days trying to figure out how to fix it."", 'I would note that I am considering retiring our pair of LR3 after about a 1.5 year trial. The thing that gets me is the smell. We never had an issue with a traditional litter box smelling. However, as soon as we set up the robots, we started getting the typical litter smell. This isn’t due to urine pooling or anything like that like some have reported. It’s simply a matter of the waste sitting more or less out in the open, unburied, in the drawer. \n\nThis is contrasted to it normally being buried in the traditional litter box where the litter can contain the odors. We’ve tried several different litters and none really make a difference, which isn’t surprising as they can only really lightly coat the waste and don’t have a chance to really absorb the odors (I set the delay to the max to try and alleviate this with no success.\n\nI tried new carbon filters, the odor absorbing packs, baking soda, a hepa filter by the robots…everything I could think/read of. The only thing that really helps is to clean out daily and/or change bags daily, which is really…wasteful and no benefit over scooping daily.\n\nI know not everyone has this issue. It’s possible one of our cats just has extra smelly…stuff. But I would be advised.', ""My only regret is that I didn't buy it when I first saw it. It has changed our lives.\n\nBefore, with three cats, my wife had to get up daily and scoop before the morning feeding or our female tabby would not use the box.  The same scooping was required evening. On top of mitigating the constant scooping and filling, and changing, the odor could become problematic at times.\n\nIt took a few weeks for the cats to acclimate, but I have learned to use this thing and keep it clean to such a high degree of satisfaction that I can honestly say its the easiest litter solution that I have ever had in 25 years of cat ownership.\n\nIt can be quirky at times but support is responsive. There are a few features that often need attention, but in the end, it's no real labor.\n\nA note: we have tried two other top-brand automatic litter boxes that two of our cats would just not use and the cost of the specialized litter was ridiculous. We use Arm and Hammer quick clump and also at times, the LitterRobot brand. A very dusty litter is problematic, but the low dust options are spot on. \n\nGet the box... you will love it."", 'One of the BEST purchases I have ever made. I bought the LR3 back in 2015. I loved it until after about 5 years it started having major issues. We replaced so many sensors and components but it just felt like we were putting band aids on it. Parts were becoming corroded and at that point I couldn’t trust it and feared my 3 cats would find other places to go to the bathroom…. So I would manually cycle the LR3. When I heard the LR4 was coming out I was nervous as I’ve heard it’s had some issues but I couldn’t help myself and bought it and received in August 2022. I LOVE THE LR4. I’m afraid to say I haven’t had any real issues as I don’t want to jinx myself…. The only thing I’ve had an issue with is when I fill the globe up with more litter I just turn the litter robot off and on again. I found a few occasions that if I just pressed the reset button I had issues with it stopping when cycling…I’m assuming because of the weight. Other than that it’s perfect. I also bought the ramp attachment. So I attached my LR3 ramp to the LR4 with it. Lastly, I’ve been using the arm and hammer slide litter and set the time to 15 minutes-works amazing and looks like a freshly cleaned litter bed every time.', 'Its worth the price if your cats actually use it. \n\nI also have two cats, but only one of them uses the LR. The other cat is deathly afraid of the machine, for some reason. So, I have to have a normal litter box and the LR which makes it kinda not worth it as now I have to manage both which defeats the whole purpose. \n\nSo, if either of your cats are skittish or you think might be afraid of it, it might not be worth it.', ""What they don't tell you is yes there is significantly less scooping, it's never no scooping, but there is a daily maintenance for this machine. It's refilling the litter level every day and unclogging clumps that stick to the liner. My cat likes to pee in one spot so there's a place the clump likes to stick to. It's also good practice to wipe down the poop chute every week as it can get gross with pee and poop clumps streaking.\n\nBut overall, it is worth it for the happiness of the cats. They love a clean bed of litter and it does help with the smell as long as you replace the carbon filter every few months."", 'I have 5 cats and two litter robots. I 100% think they are worth the money. I am by no means rich. These were HUGE purchases for me. They are not completely set it and forget it.

It is a serial communication device tasked with receiving and sending information to the control board. In the LR3's case when requested it sends onfo on the ir beams and the pinch  detect statuses. On bootup of the control board, the LR then does a series of self checks, the very first check it does is the DFI beam check, if its receiving it then goes to the pinch switch status, if its making contact it then goes to checking the weight sensor, bonnet, then home and dump position sensors as it does the start up cycle. But if the DFI is unable to send any data to the control board it immediately throws the drawer full error and when reset is pressed tries to skip to the next check which is the pinch detect and of course since them both are handled by the DFI it throws the pinch detect error and cant go any further in the self check. The pins on the I/O chip on the emitter board that always get disconnected due to corroded solder joints are the  ground, reset and initialization pins.

If so you need to remove the bonnet and check the metal contacts on the left rear of the bonnet. Check for any dirt coating them or if there is urine intrusion on the contacts causing corrosion. The contacts should be smooth to the touch and shiny. Also check the corresponding contact points on the base as well for the same.\n\nIf you do have corrosion, use a scouring pad, fine grit sand paper or steel wool to wipe clean all four contacts on the bonnet and base. Once smooth and shiny reassemble and see if this solves your concern. Also if you have your night light on make certain that you see three (3) blue lights illuminated, if there are not three illuminated and the night light is on it will also give the bonnet removed error as well. You can get around this by turning the night light off.\n\nThe louder cycling is because the drive motor gear box is most likely running dry of lubrication.

"['I don\'t use sleep mode so can\'t speak to that, but the other two issues you mention sound possibly normal to me.\n\nOn the notification front, about the only one you\'ll hopefully see with any consistency is the ""cycle complete"" notification. If you\'re not getting that notif, then you have a problem, but that\'s about the only one I\'d expect unless your LR4 encounters an error. There are no notifs for cat entering, weight taken, cycle in progress, etc. Personally, I\'d love to see all of those, with bonus points if you can enable them per cat when cat identification rolls out. One of mine has been dealing with a bit of the runs lately and knowing when he specifically has used the robot would be super helpful for keeping an eye on things.\n\nOn the litter levels, the app does say optimal until it gets pretty low. I\'ve trained myself to ignore the optimal or whatever and instead look at the circle. If it\'s only half filled, it\'ll still say ""optimal"", but I\'m going to give it a top up anyway. I\'ve found that circle to be fairly accurate, it\'s just that LR\'s definition of ""optimal"" differs a bit from my own. Maybe ""acceptable"" would be a better word for the 50% to 75% range because I get it\'s probably good enough, but I wouldn\'t call it optimal or ideal.\n\nIt\'s obviously up to you what makes the LR4 ""worth it"", but I\'ve personally chosen to accept the shortcomings in the app. Stuff like additional notifications, enhanced weight or usage tracking, cat identification and so on can be added with a simple software update and Whisker has a seemingly decent track record with improving their app. No company releases new features fast enough for customers, but I do believe they\'ll get to it. \n\nThe actual machine is a different story.

She is still not allowed to be downstairs unsupervised for now. I have 2 robots on the lower floor as well. She was also on Prozac for the last few years, but it had quit working. So I\'m also weaning her off of it slowly. She also doesn\'t love the other female cat. I really should say, the female cat doesn\'t love her, but in any case, they tolerate each other and don\'t fight. \nAll this to say. That I think the litter robots are fantastic and I have zero regrets buying them. And with the 4s being released, there are a lot of them for sale on fbook and other places. \nI\'m hoping having 4 robots will fix her issue and she can be part of the family again. She still has another 3 weeks or so before her Prozac is completely stopped. So I\'m still going to keep her upstairs when she can\'t be supervised. \nI don\'t think her inappropriate elimination would have been solved with regular litter boxes since she won\'t use one that\'s been used. I\'ve been dealing with her problem for almost 5 years. I scooped 3x a day. Morning, after work. And before bed. I had 5 litter boxes. You\'d think one of them would have worked out for her, but noooo.\n\nAlso, someone in this community has the genius idea of using a smart plug with the robots. I have wyze cameras aimed at each robot so I can monitor the problem cat and my male cat who has CKD. This came in handy 1x so far when I noticed on camera that the robot was upside down and blinking orange. I was able to turn the robot off using the smart plug and then turn it on again. Which reset the robot. Awesome!!']"
['There are other features promised before the end of 2022 but the short supply issue probably stopped all that. Was hoping to label the cats by weight to keep better track of which feline iwas using the robot. No accessories for it either like steps. I would think most of these items are drawn up at the same time the robot is designed. The price increase for the LR4 should help move that along. Lol']

"[""From all the posts I've seen positive and negative about the LR4, its a crapshoot, either they work great out of the box or they become an almost immediate nightmare afterwards. This has really made me hesitant over eventually pulling the trigger on an LR4, not to mention the urine intrusion issue because of the two piece bezel/globe design. But on the other hand it does have a different sensor system and the drive motor is very quiet in operation.\n\nFor the past two years I have owned 3 LR3's and at first they were a hand full to say the least to keep running, but after I learned of the few quirks the LR3 has and how to successfully work around them they have been reliable workhorses since!!!\n\nYes the kitten has to be at least 2.3 Kilos for the weight sensor to activate but as kitty grows this shouldn't be much of an issue. But you can let kitty use the LR and either manually cycle or get a smart outlet and set a scheduled power cycle that will take care of the lack of temporary weight sensor triggering.\n\nIMHO the LR3 is the better option until the LR4 has its major issues ironed out and becomes as stable as the LR3 can be made to be!"", 'I haven’t had any issues with my LR4.

And I don’t have as many issues with the robot thinking the tray is full when it’s not.', ""We went with the LR4, mostly because of the larger opening. It's a shame that there were so many problems for people *after* the release, but Whisker isn't hard to work with, nor as slow to respond as we sometimes do see people talk about - but if you contact them via the app, it hasn't taken us more than 24-72ish hours to be responded to from what my husband claims. To be fair,  they weren't much help via actually speaking on the phone and we communicated mostly online and were, on more than one occasion given an apology, and told that they would be rolling out another update, etc.\n\nThe LR4 did not necessarily work flawlessly for us at first, but when we set it up they were doing firmware updates nonstop to try and fix it for a lot of people that either had that problem and for people that might otherwise have it in the future I would assume. The main issue we had was that it wouldn't complete a cycle automatically more than once (if that) before it would stop under an assortment of errors. We ended up cleaning the robot manually for a little less than a few weeks but did find that unplugging or powering it off and then on triggered its usual cycle and saved us from that chore now and then. \n\nNow, the LR4 is a dream and has been since the issues were resolved after a month or a little more I think. My current biggest complaint would have to be that the cameras and bezel that they're positioned in are now consistently giving me an error via the Whisker app (used to manage the LR) to clean them, though I've done so under what they tell you to do. Using a microfiber cloth and NO cleaning sprays/etc are what is needed. There is a trick some use with a can of condensed air to blow directly into the bezel with is often used to clean other electronics, though I have yet to try it. The LR4 still works very well, though I do wonder if the cameras are having issues seeing the level of waste since as soon as I change it, it claims it's at 20% lol\n\nYou'll want a pack of wipes to clean any mess a clumsy kitty might spray in the wrong place no matter which LR you get. I don't recall if LR3 has one, but the LR4 has a litter guard that attaches to the bottom of the outer casing (the thing that the globe is positioned in, so it won't turn with the globe, and isn't in the way) and it does help to keep things a little cleaner in blocking litter being kicked out. Usually, I just very quickly wipe off the easily accessible parts with said wipes when I need to change the waste bag underneath the globe which is about once a week for my one plus-size cat. He grew accustomed to it very quickly. You'll need to make sure the LR is on hardwood, vinyl, etc. No carpet and you want it to be a level floor. You will want a litter mat as well of course. I know my cat likes to launch his butt out when he's done and if there's that or a more aggressive kitty with trying to bury his mess, this is a good option. We want to rave about ordering more of the supplies you need from Whisker (convenient for us). They will ship out litter, waste bags, and other accessories you may want. They have these things called odor blockers and while they work very well with how quickly the mess is dropped into the lower bin and bag, I also want to say that it hasn't been necessary for the time being.\n\nGood luck!! 👍 😁"", ""I am cheap. I bought the base model LR3, Costco litter, and Costco 10 gallon bags. Also bought the LR ramp and fence/guard which both help with litter tracking. Works perfect. No issues with my 2 cats.

There is an option on the app in the settings section that DOES give access to a troubleshooting guide and manual/instructions for both LR3&4 separately.

I used to work in the field and quickly learned that 8/10 people will complain vs the 2/10 that will rave in delight over everything to others. People often don't NEED to post and talk about all the good stuff vs others who are already riled up over confusion and looking for both help & an area to vent their frustration.

When we select one that details what we see and looks like what we're dealing with, it continues to try and guide us in fixing the issue. It worked for me when I went down that route a while back. I get that it may be a complex issue that most can't fix on their own, such as a firmware update which is what we initially needed. To fix that kind of thing or something else was out of our control, we can rely on Whisker. Actually getting a response didn't take long for us at the start. I also understand that wait times may have suddenly increased, but waiting a day or two wasn't that huge of a deal for me with this kind of product. I need to also confess that this issue was not the last and while I did type out more, I felt it easier to condense for now 🤔\n\nTLDR? It was a headache during my first impression and I feel BADLY for anyone needing to do the same kind of things to fix it and modify how to deal in the meantime.

"[""Our situation is a bit unique, We have 3 LR3's in a rescue that currently houses 32 cats, a majority of them have their favorite LR, (that poor LR, over 1600 cycles a month on average!) but all 3 get used.

It kind of encourages NOT cleaning the litter box. I mean, that’s the whole point, right? But sometimes it gets a bit … gummy, if you don’t take the globe outside and hose it down. It’s better than the LR was (my first LR lasted a LONG freakin’ time, like 7+ years) but it gets funky in weird places. Any litter in the gearbox can really mess with the mechanism, though that didn’t happen too often. \n\nAlso, it was loud. I mean, it’s white noise, so it’s not too bad. But I could hear it going off from 2 rooms away. And it really seemed like it needed to be emptied WAY more often. We had 4 cats at the time, and it was about once every three days. The previous LR had been roughly every 4 days. This might be mostly laziness on my part, though, since the litter drawer was physically larger on the LR3, but the 3 had a sensor and stopped running if it was full. But I THINK the shape of the drawer didn’t help distribute the clumps very well, so they kinda mounded up and caused the sensor to say it was full when it wasn’t, really. \n\nBut after a few years, one of the sensors in the  LR3 went wonky and it started staying upside-down a lot. I called the helpline and troubleshooted it, got a new sensor, took the thing apart (nontrivial but simple enough) and fixed it. It worked great! For about three months. Then upside-down again. I ordered the part again and fixed it again. It didn’t help. Tried troubleshooting it again, don’t know what was wrong. Replaced the main board, too. That worked for a few days. Probably just … worn out, I guess? It didn’t last as long as the LR1. \n\nThe LR4, which I bought refurbished like every other LR that I’ve bought, looks to be crazy good.

Not sure ‘cause I don’t own any… /s) \n\nSuper wide entrance, which I think will make cats more comfortable with it. Larger cats should be able to turn around way better. \n\nSeems to be a stronger motor, it doesn’t struggle at all to turn even with a full litter load. \n\nConnected with an app by default, which was a $100 option for the LR3 that I didn’t have.', 'I ended up purchasing a higher fence on Etsy, and it works great.
