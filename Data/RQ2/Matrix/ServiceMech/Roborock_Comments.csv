The S8 has more sensors, and more advanced software. \n\nThe S7MaxUltra and Q Revo\'s object avoidance is called reactive tech, and is as basic as possible. It only has one light sensor, no cameras, and is like the name, only reactive. If it senses an object it will avoid it, rather than having any form of definition. \n\nThe S7MaxV is still the most powerful and sophisticated system in those regards. It may be ""older"" but it\'s no less capable overall to any of the newest vacuums, minus the dual rollers for carpets. In fact, the newest robots also no longer have user removable water tanks, or even mop pads on most models. \n\nMopping is good across all of the mop-capable Roborock robots. It\'s down to your personal preferences.\n\n Q7 and Q7Max have a very basic mop, the user must install, uninstall and clean as needed, but still performs well. S7 and up use the Vibrarise system. It employs a vibrating mop pad, and it will lift up when it detects carpets. The Q Revo is the first and only Roborock to have dual spinning mops.\n\nAll of them have proven to mop well overall, with much less of a difference between them than would be expected. Many reviews and videos have shown as much. \n\nAny model with the ultra dock will self empty and self clean the robot, for more hands off cleaning. The S8 has a dual zone vibrating system, but it hasn\'t actually shown to be any better than the single vibration zone.\n\nPersonally I own the Q Revo, as it was too good of a value for me to pass up. I love it, It cleans very well! Both vacuuming and mopping work better than I\'ve ever had with older robots. As of now I have no qualms with it. Roborock lists the Q Revo dock as not being self-cleaning, however it takes half the effort to clean compared to the regular Ultra dock, and with less moving parts. I also like having the option to take off the mop pads completely if I ever need the robot to clean high pile carpets. \n\nThe only thing I wish it had was the liftable rollers for when your only mopping.

The V signifies Video, meaning camera based AI Object Detection. Hence why no other machines have cameras, or V in their names. The S8 line, S7MaxUltra, and Q Revo, have all ditched the RGB cameras, but kept the structure light system. Albeit less advanced on the cheaper machines.

No camera, also means no advanced AI, meaning a less powerful computer can be used. Helping cut down on the price to build the robot. This is seen with the S7MaxUltra and Q Revo. Both units take a large hit in terms of object detection, but are much cheaper, while still being fully capable robots. \n\nThe S8 line is the partial exception.

"['Keep in mind I\'ve only owned the Q Revo for 1 week, but these are my thoughts:\n\nI also own the S7 MaxV Ultra which is marketed as self-cleaning. The reality is they\'re both self-cleaning, but in my opinion the Q Revo is better at keeping the dock base clean, needs less maintenance, and should be more reliable since there\'s no moving parts.\n\nThe S7 MVU cleans the mop pad with a motorized brush and then pushes the dirty water in the dock base to a small filter before it\'s sucked up into the dirty water tank. The Q Revo does not need a brush or a complex mechanism. The robot simply spins its rotating pads against the plastic teeth in the tray and gravity does the work of moving the water through the filter in the tray. No dirty water ever leaves the tray so the dock stays clean.\n\nThe filter on the S7 MVU traps dirt inside it and is a bit annoying to clean, but they fixed this issue on the new S8. Usually when I remove the filter on the S7 MVU, water leaks out into the base or onto the floor. This isn\'t a problem with the Q Revo, because the Q Revo dries the pull out tray while it dries the mops. Whenever I pull out the tray in the Q Revo it\'s always fully dry.\n\nOn the S7 MVU, once every 2 months you\'re supposed to clean the ""high speed maintenance brush"". That\'s pretty simple - it pops right out and cleans easily. But dirt gets trapped around the plastic holding the brush and whenever people post pictures here you\'ll see that part always looks dirty. On the Q Revo, like I said there is no brush so no maintenance or additional cleaning is every required.\n\nPersonally, I hope Roborock ditches the Vibrarise pad and goes with the Q Revo style rotating pads and dock on their flagships. If the Q Revo had the S7 MVU\'s camera/obstacle avoidance system it would likely be the best robot on the market.']"

"[""Your best bet is to go through at least one, or twice, a week and clean the tanks by hand with warm soapy water. Give them a good scrub. I follow through with a citric acid based sanitizer like Clorox free and clear.\n\nTap water naturally contains some bacteria, double so for city water. Anytime water is sitting for days, it gets stagnant and the bacteria already in it start to multiply. This happens with, or without a cleaner. Unless that cleaner is specifically antibacterial, chances are something may grow given enough time. Or for the case in the dirty water tank, it's cleaned up your flooring and all that dirt and bacteria are now in the tank, with food, so they grow. \n\nThe Omo solution is a standard floor cleaner, with the only antibacterial property being it works like soap to help remove bacteria and odors from the floors. Otherwise it's ingredients are meant to help control the growth of bacteria, but won't completely stop it. This is why the docks still need regular maintenance.\n\nIf you tanks have gotten stained, then I would try using properly diluted bleach to clean them. As long as the bleach is diluted correctly, it shouldn't hurt anything. Just be sure to rinse everything after.\n\nI would like to point out, the Roborock cleaning solution found overseas and on AliExpress, is antibacterial per the information.

Or, the bottom plate for the floating brush needs to be replaced, because the felt on the bottom of it has worn off. This goes for nearly all vacuums to some extent.

The wheels are rubber, the roller is rubber, the spinning brush is rubber and soft bristles, and on the bottom of the floating brush plate is a rubber strip that stays on the floor helping to pick dirt up, and felt pads directly behind it to prevent scratches. \n\nIf you have a particularly delicate floor, a manual vacuum using a bristle-only floor head may be your best bet. \n\nIn the case of this person it unfortunately sounds like a potential hardware problem and they should contact Roborock.

Whereas smooth flooring like vinyl causes much less wear and tear on such parts. You can see this more prominently on something like a rubber squeegee as it slowly breaks down overtime. \n\nAgain, that's why they sell replacements. Again, all 3 of my previous robots have them available for replacement if needed.

"['Yea I think you are spot on.  I would have said look at the Q Revo, but you mentioned the plumbing peice for the Ultra dock.', ""Yes. The S7MaxUltra, and Q Revo use the new Reactive Tech obstacle avoidance system, utilizing structured light, per Roborock. T he S8 I believe uses the same system, albeit with a slightly different name: Reactive 3D obstacle avoidance.***\n\nAll of them allow for 3D maps, so I'm not sure if there is any difference at all. I've heard mixed things about there being a camera still in this new system. It doesn't seem like it has one, but some said it might be a black and white only camera. It's been confusing on that front.\n\n* In case anyone else sees this, it Turns out the system is a little more advanced on the S8 series."", 'That’s incorrect, the S8 uses a more complex system of IR to detect objects more accurately, that was said also by Jamie on his video and on the comments section. Reactive Tech is a much simpler system where it barely detects that there’s smth in front of the robot. The 3D maps are created by the laser tower. My Q7 has 3D maps as well.', ""Thank you, honestly I think I'm just in shock. I've been researching and looking at new robots for a couple years but pushed it off more and more, as I shouldn't spend that much money anyway. I knew I was missing out with my old robots, but I never realized just how much I was missing, nor did I realize how much there were missing. I got used to running them twice, sometimes more, before mopping and whatnot.\n\n One single run with the Roborock and it's clean. Did a mop run and I can actually tell how well it worked. I genuinely didn't expect it to be that drastic!""]"
"[""You have to remember, the S7MaxVUltra Is nearly two years old now. Many of your complaints have been changed or fixed with the newest robots. I'm sure several more will still come with further updates as well. Due to the S7MaxV being more advanced, updates may take a little more time for certain things.\n\nMany things you want are only coming out just now. The hot water cleaning on the Ecovac just came out. The dryer and auto fill was added on after it became wanted by the market. The dryer is now standard on all the new docks. Mopping of small wet soils an such is why the rollers can be lifted up on the S8ProUltra to help avoid problems with the rollers. These robots are not intended to replace a Dyad, not yet anyway. There is also no need to mop really wet as it doesn't have a way to mop up that much extra water with it's limited pad area. It also brings the danger of damaging some floors too. It's necessary to pre-wash the mops before cleaning to ensure they are not only clean, but fully moistened for better cleaning right away, as has been a common complaint before the ultra docks. \n\nThe maps are updated in real time, negotiate need to redo your map. If you close a door it will update. Then if you open it and run it again, it will update again. \n\nThe newest robots are plenty quiet. Unbelievably so for me, compared to my old robot. I was worried mine was working right at first it was so quiet. Even on Max+ I don't consider it loud. \n\nBattery life and size is a hardware thing. You can only cram so much into such a tight package. For the size houses these robots are intended to be capable of, they need to be bigger. That said Roborock has some of the longest run-times on the market anyways. You can always get more runtime by adjusting your settings and whatnot. Charging is always faster with each update. I believe the current new robots charge something like 30% faster than the s7 series as a whole. \n\nNaming absolutely could be, and should be better. They are starting to do a little better, but they still need some more cohesion between them all . \n\nIn the end, these robots are still pulling more work than us humans do at times. Just having one helps keep the dirt in check in a busy house. Add on self emptying and self cleaning mops, and you just got a godsend. It might not be a full maid, but it sure helps a ton!""]"
"[""Maybe. But I don't think so. I can go into the app, select a few rooms and tell it to do them 3x. Or change suction/water flow and send it to do a certain zone. Etc. So the robot is capable to do custom runs.\n\nRoutines, as far as I understand them, is just saving such a custom run as a favorite. Which sounds like a 100% app thing.\n\nI don't know the specifics. I know a bit about the object recognition hardware, but that's it.""]"

How much mopping do you plan on doing? Do you have pets? \n\nIf you have a large amount of carpet and plan on doing a good amount of mopping, the S8 Pro Ultra is a great machine. It has the most suction available right now, has dual rollers for better carpet cleaning, a self cleaning dock, and specific to the ProUltra version, the dual rollers lift up for mopping. \n\nThis means it can better resist anything getting wet and built up in the rollers, and can mop up small spots and drops of liquid and whatnot without it getting dragged into the rollers too. Also, the Ultra dock is considered self cleaning, meaning it is a little more hands off.\n\nThe Revo is a great machine all around too. It has plenty of suction, is very quiet, and cleans well. It mops well too though I haven't personally done a ton of mopping just yet. \n\nIs very similar to other models otherwise. It's effectively a great update to the lineup. It has the second most powerful suction right along with the S7MaxUltra. It also has the reactive obstacle avoidance, and the dock is fully capable of emptying the dustbin, washing and drying the mops too. The dock is not considered self cleaning, hower the whole bottom tray pops out and can be cleaned as needed. It's very easy to do and is probably better than the actual Ultra dock, as there is less moving parts. \n\nBoth the S8ProUltra and the Q Revo have fully featured app access. There is a ton of customization and options regardless of machine. It might take a little time to dial everything to your liking but it's very straightforward to use."", 'I just got the q revo and love it! We have pets and two kids. In all fairness we clean up regularly I’m not worried about object avoidance for small objects. \nThe mopping is great and would 100% buy again.', 'I thought I would too and was shocked at the performance of the Q Revo. You made a good point about the spinning mopping pads not getting close to walls like the S series. That is correct. A drawback for sure, although I always suggest people cleaning near baseboards with a broom and mop or wet dry mop like the Dyad Pro. In that case the difference matters a little less.', 'For sure, you still have to do that with the normal mop pad indeed, it’s just better for chairs and things like that.

It is very hard to test without having real log haired dogs in my home.', 'To be fair, I’ve tried only with the Dreame, so I can’t be 100% sure.

Q5 is a more basic dry only vacuum, available with a self empty bin. The Q7 is a vacuum that adds basic mop capabilities and it also has slightly stronger suction. Most recently, the now top-of-the-Q-range model is the Q Revo. It has updated suction, basic object avoidance, and a full dock that cleans the mops and empties the robot. The slight exception here is that it uses two spinning mops vs. the vibrating pad mop on the S series.

If you have hard floors, any models with the single roller should be fine. Roborocks thankfully clean well across all models overall, even when they have lower suction. \n\nSince you don't need a mop, you could probably get away with a Q5 and save the money. \n\nThat said, from most suction to least, the two newest robots, the S7MaxUltra and the Q Revo, are the second to highest in terms of suction across all models currently.

My guess is over time this will start to smell pretty bad.\n\nWith the Q Revo, you have a removable plastic insert that you will likely have to clean once per week. The self-drying system also dries the plastic insert. Cleaning this doesn\'t seem much different than cleaning the filter from the S7/S8 series, with the exception that there\'s no motorized brush and brush housing to also clean.

That said, you should be able to use the regular + dock with it, with no problems. Though of course, you can't auto clean the mops on those. \n\nHave you turned on less collision mode in your settings? That might help a bit with it getting stuck. It should automatically suggest areas as no-go over time, but you can always set them manually as needed. \n\nThese robots are frequently updated, so you might have some problems right now with it still being new, but in another couple weeks it might be fixed. Not always but they are good at regular updates.This also means that over time the robot should adjust to better routing and faster cleaning. \n\n\nNearly all the new Roborocks have multi floor mapping, however this is also heavily dependent on just how big your floors are, and how much dirt you have. \n\nIdeally you want to hand clean the whole house and do a deep vacuum manually with a full sized vacuum the best you can before using the robot. Robots clean better than people may think, which is both good and bad. This means while they do actually clean, they may fill up faster than is ideal for some homes. \n\nIf your floors are pretty clean, then you can turn down the water usage and mop cleaning frequency. This will have it dock less and clean more. \n\n While I wouldn't use the Q Revo to fully replace the S8 Ultra, they would be good to pair them with. Also personally, if I had that size house and money, I would get whatever is cheapest with the same features I want for the floors I don't generally spend time on, and save the Roborock S8Ultra for your main living floor. I like Roborock but I do wish they would lower their prices a little as the competition is getting very good for much cheaper. \n\nIf you wanted to keep it all Roborock of course, I would get a Q5+  for the other floors for daily cleaning, and use the S8Ultra for just mopping. Or get the Q7+ that does have basic mopping. There is also the S7MaxV if obstacle avoidance is a must and you still want mopping, however I would go without the auto bins to save the money.\n\nHonestly, do whatever you feel works best for you.

Having owned several Roombas years back, and then forking over the $$$\'s for the S7 Max V Ultra setup a while back?  I\'m still of the opinion all of these robot cleaning vacs are really just ""tech toys"" for those of us into technology.\n\nI\'m fascinated by all the stuff you can do with one now, like giving it commands via Alexa to clean various rooms, and the app on the phone showing me the routes it took on each cleaning cycle. The obstacle avoidance is interesting to see in action, and it\'s great they figured out how to vacuum AND mop with the same unit. The dock that empties the dust-bin and dirty water and all that? Cool. But anyone being purely practical and looking at the economics is going to say, ""Come on now! That thing won\'t ever even really pay for itself!"" and they\'re honestly right.\n\nI mean, when you look at the number of these vacuums that develop hardware problems/failures after a few years of use, you\'re already behind a good traditional vacuum cleaner than might last a person 10 years or more. (My Dyson went 13 years without breaking.) But the whole thing about all the time it saves you? Well, it\'s more like time-shifting your labor, because you still have to do maintenance on the robot itself and the dock. You\'re going to have to eventually change out the spinning side brush and remove the mop once in a while, and buy the special dust bin bags it needs and the cleaning solution. And with all that? Sooner or later, you\'ll still need to clean the edges of your walls and around furniture where these robo-vacs just can\'t get everything as clean as the rest of the surfaces they run on. (Oh, and I\'ve got a basement and a second floor to deal with here too. So not like a Roborock can go between floors on its own either.)\n\nSo nah - I say use whichever one you\'ve got and try to get as much cleaning out of it as you can. Don\'t chase after whatever the latest and supposedly greatest is.']"

I know it\'s good but yikes that\'s a lot of cash.\n\nThe Q Revo presently surprised me, everything I\'m interested in, but a better price, while still being under a big brand name, so to speak. While not cheap, it\'s a steal of a deal with the coupon.

You would say “well that’s barely any diff”, well these robots compared to grabbing a mop and a bucket, they suck at mopping, so every little bit of improving the mopping helps to close the gap with manually mopping. \n\nLastly we need to see how easy is the station for cleaning it, granted you can detach the rinsing part and wash it but is that all it needs to be cleaned? Or is there more to it? On the S8 pro ultra the dock is self cleaning and I detach the filter, wash it and clean with a napkin where it sits and that’s it, it’s really that simple.

Didn't think to look for a roborock subreddit. I'll just copy paste my post from there. \n\nI just replaced my S9+ with an S8 Pro Ultra a few weeks ago. I've had various roombas over the last 10 years or so and will not be going back. I've never owned a mop vacuum before as I figured they were a gimmick tbh. I watched some reviews on this and the S7 Ultra Max or whatever it's called and was impressed.\n\nMapping:\nOverall, the mapping and navigation is no comparison. The S8 mapped my downstairs without banging into stuff in about 10 minutes. My roomba took over an hour easily to do the same thing. The map produced by the Roborock is super detailed and it will even add no goes for floor vents so it avoids them on it's own. \n\nThe roomba would take quite some time to vacuum around and under the dining room table and chairs. It would go in one area, then get stuck and bounce around for quite some time before finding a way out. This would add 15 minutes to the cleaning time in that room. The S8 just glides around the chair and table legs with ease, it's really unbelievable. \n\nMopping works pretty well. We have all hardwood flooring with some area rugs downstairs. The mopping works well to remove dried on water spots from our dog between the times our cleaners come. That's really the only reason I wanted the mopping feature. So I could keep the floor looking good between cleanings. \n\nI watched this video after having my S8 for a week or two and his experience is very similar to mine regarding mapping and performance. It's definitely worth a watch. He compares the mapping and cleaning of the S8 Ultra Pro to a Roomba S9+ and their mopping vacuum. \n\nSkip to 5:55 for the mapping comparison and other tests.\nhttps://youtu.be/6aNONpstdys\n\nThere really is no comparison. If my i7+ that I have on the second floor of the house wasn't still working decently, I'd swap that with a Roborock as well. I probably will in the future. My S9+ is in the garbage since it began having navigation and mapping issues over the last two months or so. It was taking twice as long to clean the same areas, it would seem to get lost in the middle of open areas and it was just LOUD. The Roborock vacuums so much faster and more efficiently. My S9+ would take 2 hours to vacuum most of my first floor not counting charge time. The S8 in vacuum mode does the same are in a little over half that time and without a recharge. It varies but it's typically between 60-70mins.\n\nThe automatic pad cleaning of the mop works very well too. It comes out looking very clean. I think replacements are $12/piece so I'll just replace it once a month or so depending how much mopping I do. I also use purified water in the tank to help reduce scale build up. For the $1 a jug, it's worth not having to deal with build up. I also use the Roborock floor cleaner. It doesn't really have any sort of smell when diluted in the water tank and it doesn't streak or leave behind a film or sticky feeling on your floors. Overall I'm super impressed with it."", 'One of my favorites was when it stopped at my vent covers, which are all of 1/4 inch high maybe? The M6 said it was on a cliff.', 'On paper the t8 isn’t that far behind the x1 or s8 but in practice like i said, the s8 is head and shoulders above the t8. Navigation is better. The t8 would get lost or ruin the saved map often enough to annoy me and since the t8 doesn’t have a quick map feature i would have to tidy up the whole house before I could allow it to vacuum everywhere while it setup the map again since all my no go zones are gone too. Obstacle avoidance is way better on the s8. It has yet to try an eat a single usb cable. The t8 would eat them all. The s8’s low power mode is quieter mode which is great for running at night and it’s high power mode is more powerful than the t8’s too. Obviously the auto mop is better but that’s not a fair comparison. Most of my issues were with the software both onboard and the app. It definitely got worse over time so i suspect they shift focus over to the x1 and allowed the t8 software to get worse since i started noticing the regressions around the time the x1 was released. But if you’re happy with you x1 yea, don’t upgrade. i was just personally soured by my t8 purchase (bought it 3yrs ago for $400 w/ dock) so the x1 would’ve needed to be clearly better than the s8 for me to have considered another ecovacs.']"
"['I\'m not sure which vendor you\'re using for your WiFi, but it is fairly common for guest networks to have ""host isolation"", where two different devices on the guest network cannot talk directly to one another. Unfortunately, Roborock depends on being able to do this during part of its setup.\n\nIf you can turn off host isolation for a bit, that will probably solve your problem (the other common issue for new setup is ""band steering"" trying to push the vacuum up 5 GHz, but you\'ve indicated that\'s not an issue).\n\nIf you can\'t, you can *probably* resolve it with another access point by turning off the guest network, setting the second access point up with the same SSID and password that your guest network usually has, setting up the vacuum on that, and then putting the access points back the way they were. The Roborock should reconnect to the guest network and be fine: it doesn\'t need to connect directly to your phone after setup. That is, however, a lot of effort and might not be worth it.']"

"[""The problem with scratching is that any particle on the floor big enough could be made to vibrate and scratch.\nNot sure if it's 100% possible to prevent this.\nIt would help to always use a high setting to vacuum, to remove said particles before the mop touches the area."", ""You mentioned a real wood floor. Is it considered hardwood or softwood? And is it treated?\nIt is recommended to not wet mop softwood floors very often as the water can seep into the wood. Which would eventually cause either damage or warping. Like only wet mop four times a year max for example.\n\nI have both the S7 MaxV Ultra(Nov 2022), with the drying module which was an extra $100, and the S8 Pro Ultra(April 2023).\n\nAs for your questions:\nNeither of them I've had a problem with scratching my wood floors. Mine are softwood so I dry mop them manually but mostly where the vacuums can't get to.\n\nBefore I got the dryer module for my S7 MaxV Ultra. I used to not have it scheduled to do anything for 24 hours after a mop wash cycle, it would be completely dry within 18 to 22 hours. This would prevent it from potentially dragging around a damp mop pad. Due to doing this I never really noticed a smell from it.\nOnce I got the dryer module it would be dried within 3 hours and it could be sent out again.\n\nAs for the dirty water tank smell, that is to be expected if you don't empty it right after a mop cleaning cycle. Because it just sits there in its own bleh water and becomes stagnant. But you won't notice it very often for either model if you only have a certain amount of mop days in the week. I only have 2 rooms that are mopped twice a week. And I don't have to dispose or refill either until the end of the week. With the S8 Pro Ultra I think I could actually go a second week without refilling or disposing the water tanks. But that just depends on the amount of surface you want covered and how frequently you have it go back to wash the mop, for me it's every 10 minutes which is the lowest setting and I use the most thorough route, deep+ is what I think it's called. So it just depends on how often you dispose of the dirty water tank throughout the week. Along with if you rinse it and wipe it out. You could let it dry but I don't bother, I snap it back closed and just put it back on the dock.\n\nFor the smell of the S8 mop, I haven't noticed any smell from it either. And from what I understand I could probably set the drying to 2 hours instead of 3. But I haven't tried that yet.\n\nOne thing to note for vacuuming on hard surfaces, the S7 MaxV Ultra does very well compared to the S8 Pro Ultra. This might be due to the airflow being higher for one roller compared to two rollers.\nFor carpet due to the dual rollers, with the extra agitation to the carpet, I'd say the S8 Pro Ultra does better on carpet.\n\nFortunately for me most of my main floor is either carpet or rugs and my lower floor is mostly polished concrete.\n\nThe only gripe I have with the S7 MaxV Ultra is the problems with seeing reflections on hard surfaces of either furniture, cabinets, or appliances. And making an obstacle in that location then despite it coming from a different angle, not removing it or remembering for the next cleaning cycle. Basically I had a spot that it never cleaned in my kitchen because of this. Fortunately I don't have this issue with the S8 Pro Ultra.\n\nHopefully this helps you with your decision!"", 'Thank you a lot. That helps. I have white oak, so that is hardwood.

"[""Not sure how this thing runs on carpet. Every area of the house mine covers is tile and hardwood. That being said, my own experience with the unit is very positive. \n\nBought mine September, 2022 and it runs every night at 8 PM. I also have the dryer module to dry the mop pad after every scheduled cleaning - As long as I keep up with proper maintenance, she runs beautifully with no issues. Every three days, I need to add water and detergent  to the clean water bin and clean the dirty water bin on the docking station. I clean the dirty water filter weekly, robot sensors monthly, and clean the bot and docking station once every 3 months (quarterly). I ensure the vaccum channel in the dock remains clear as needed, and replace the mop pad, dock mop cleaning brush, robot side brush, vacuum spin brush, and air filter, and dust bag when prompted. Keeping extra parts and supplies for maintenance on hand is the way to go. \n\n***Pros/Cons:*** The maintenance is a bit tedious, but it's far better than sweeping and mopping my home daily. It's quality of work is good, but it struggles in some areas. Larger objects can jam the brush and it doesn't do well with thick grime or caked on dirt. Large wet/sticky messes like this have to be cleaned up with human labor. This thing is primarily built to handle dried debris like spilled cereal, potato chip fragments, short hair, and light grime like dirt scuffs on the floor. I do a brief FOD Walk (Foreign Object Damage) before every cleaning to make sure there's nothing on the floor that can jam the brush. I see this as a good thing as it keeps me more conscious of my house cleanliness, and it takes far less time than performing a full-on cleaning with a broom and mop. Hard to reach areas are very limited based on the robots size and maneuverability, so some areas like tight corners and narrow areas will be missed. \n\nIn all, I'd say this robot is exceptional for what it was made for, but it does come with some work and maintenance.\n\n1. If you're expecting something that can take care of everything for you, then you're expecting too much. It has its limitations as described above, so expect light duty cleaning in most cases. \n\n2. If you're expecting something that can fully take care of itself, then you're expecting too much. This thing WILL save you time and work, but only by a third of what you might expect. You'll have to keep up with some scheduled tasks to take care of it, and routine replacement parts will cost you some money as they wear."", ""It sounds like you should do a dedicated vacuum run before doing a vacuum and mop, or just a mop. Probably would recommend having it clean and area twice or so before moping. The actual vacuum head is slightly smaller than the mop so it's to be expected that some dirt might get past it. The vacuum and mop function is more for when you know the floor is most clean enough already for the mop. \n\nIf your mopping isn't cleaning we'll have it cleans itself more often. In general for all robots it's good to do a thorough deep clean in the whole area the robot will be, and then let the robot keep up with it. When it comes to pets you may still need to do a separate deep clean every now and then. This also depends on the flooring, unsealed wood and tile floors hold dirt no matter the mop used. The only thing you can clean them with is a real floor scrubber like the Roborock Dyad or Tineco iFloor. Same goes for anything highly textured, you need the water, scrub action, and suction to lift it out of the crevasses. The robot will still help keep up with it, but won't necessarily resolve it. \n\nIf you're having trouble with pet hair then you should replace the all rubber brush roll with the Q5/Q7 roll that actually has bristles on it. This isn't just a Roborock thing, I have a different brand that does the same thing, had to put the regular roller with the bristles on for better carpet performance. Also again, it's a robot, it can only do so much at once. It may just be getting filled faster than you expect and causing it to lose suction fast. Do a deep clean on the carpet areas first, and regularly, then let it help keep up. \n\nThe new S8 is better for carpets in general as it now has a dual roller system for better cleaning. This is also a well known thing. Irobot have been the only robots that can actually clean carpets well, up until their patent expired and Roborock now has a similar version. The dual rollers make double the difference. Unfortunately this isn't shared as much as it should be, single roller robots can only do so much for carpets. \n\nOf course make sure you do normal maintenance as needed, check, clean, and replace your filters too. The mop pads need manual cleaning too, it's best to buy a couple and change them out every couple of days or so. They also have the habit of staining, they might actually be clean but won't look it. \n\nI think a good note to anyone is that while today's robots do a ton, and are getting better every day, they don't completely replace a real deep cleaning, nor are they completely meant to. You might be able to go twice as long between deep cleanings but it's still a necessary task. Some might be able to get away with never needing to, but that's rare. Especially if you have pets.

Another way, is purchasing 2 or more bots. Or, if you wish to keep your advice, making the battery loose a lot of his possible lifespan, good luck then.

Meaning, roll the vacuum back and forth a foot or two in a straight line - ie, forward and backward, so you’re moving it parallel to the wheels. Apparently this helps the wheels get recalibrated.

My 2019 Roborock S6 is flawless and the many Roombas I have owned were also reliable.', ""My last purchase for my use was in 2019 of an S6 for vacuuming only. So I'm not current. At that time Roborock clearly had superior software to Roomba and perhaps everyone. But since 2019 I have bought two mid grade Roombas a gifts because of superior carpet rug cleaning and a reliable dock. I do run an old Roomba for my second floor. \n\nToday I would probably buy a Q5 for my first floor. Roborock probably does less bumping of painted cabinets and wood furniture legs than Roomba,  and the complex nav has been great with many no-go zones.\n\nUpstairs today  I would probably buy the Roomba J7+. The dual rollers probably clean the rugs better than Roborock, and the dock is well reviewed. Roombas mechanically have always been excellent and the machines are typically long lived.\n\nFrom what I've seen the highest end models from most manufacturers are the poorest value. Frequent good, reliable cleaning is what is important. Slightly better performance with each run at a higher cost isn't good value because the benefit of robotic cleaning is achieved through excess. No way I would ever manually clean my first floor for an hour each night regardless of visible dirt.\n\nMopping is obviously critical for some buyers but I don't do robo-mopping on wood. I find using a manual microfiber mop better, safer but still quick for wood floors. Manual microfiber mopping can be  unpopular because it pushes debris around. But with prior robo-vacuuming there is no debris to push. \n\nAlso, I only occasionally have a dog in the house. A household with multiple dogs or cats obviously should heavily weight pet hair performance reviews in the purchase decision. Especially how often the machine brushes need manual removal of accumulated pet hair. Having a dock isn't much of an advantage if the machine needs to be cleaned by hand every run or two.\n\nA dock matters less without pets but depends on ones habits. I empty my first floor S6 every morning after starting coffee. I'm sure as heck will never forget the coffee, so no dock is fine. But my second floor Roomba emerges from a spare bedroom to clean and I don't have good emptying habits for that unit. That unit was purchased before docks were a thing and refuses to break to allow replacement.""]"
"[""When mopping, the robot applies force on the mop in order to provide more effective cleaning. The downside as you have found out is that the tires may not grip when needed in certain areas, or simply cannot overcome the sheer force of the resistance against the mop and the floor when it needs to turn or in this case, avoid or traverse an obstacle. Some flooring is better than others as well, the smoother the floor the better, rough floors will act like Velcro.\n\n It's worth noting here too, this isn't just a Roborock thing, I have a different brand and it has similar issues. Although it really struggles when I use a different mop pad vs the original ones. The original ones clean well but don't have as much resistance as the knockoff ones I bought as backup.\n\nIf you haven't already try turning on less collision mode on the settings. If that doesn't help then draw a little avoid area around when you know the robot has problems."", 'My apologies!

But generally you want to buy those tapes that are thick with neodymium magnet strip in the middle, those almost always work, it looks similar to the original one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2awsu2nqiua1.jpeg?width=202&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93e7cdb5c6b35c3edaeeb05ff9b9811ead60cf0a', 'Hello check this post, hope this help. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/aipbgi/magnetic_virtual_walls_for_robot_vacuums/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf']"
"['Tbh, s8 ultra is not really a big diffeerence because when mopping, the a7 maxv ultra will only do slightly worse with removing stains because of the missing dual vibration on the mop and overal do similar or better said, s8 might get more of the stain removed than the s7']"
"['Here is my experience: \nI do have all hardfloor and hardwood \n- I have the s7 MaxV ultra \n- mop is really worth it since you do have hardwood \n- there is nothing same as S7 without mop .. you can basically ignore it if you don’t want it .. but from experience it does make a big difference \n- I have a Husky never attack it and the vacuum actually avoid her \n- shedding will not be worst than a Husky trust me she none stop shedding \n-Get Q5 brush replacement for the S7 it make big difference for the hair part \n- warranty and support really not worth it since they are really bad .. the only bad part about Roborock \n- So far compere to my old S9 roomba and Omni X1 day and night different \n- Mop trust me you will be surprised how much dirty is the floor with a dog \n- Hope that will help you .. enjoy your new toy \n-', ""Does the Q5's bristles help with picking up hair?\n\nI wonder why they didn't include that design on the S8s""]"
