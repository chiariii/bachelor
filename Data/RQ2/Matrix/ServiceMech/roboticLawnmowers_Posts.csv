"Lawn mower robot without Perimeter wire. What can we buy TODAY?Hi I am searching all over the place, the only option I found that has a ""Add to cart"" button is the Husqvarna EPOS series. 

&#x200B;

I am not talking about the robots that will be released in the future, I am asking TODAY (4/1/2023), in United States, what are our options currently? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Ecovac Goat, soon to be release, but no press info, not even on the usa site, i dont trust it will ever be released. 

\*Mammotion Luba Air, says June, i dont trust it."
"Choosing the best robot for our lawnHi! 

We've been looking for a robotic lawn mower for our garden and need some help deciding. We have a garden that has about 1800m2 so we need something capable of dealing with a fairly large area. 

After much research we have narrowed the fight between Worx Landroid L2000 WR155E and Cramer RM2700. Price wise they are pretty much similar, both are sold locally, although the Worx one is offered by multiple different sellers around the country while the Cramer one isn't. Feature wise the Worx one seems to be also a bit more feature packed (or has more addon options), but some reviews suggest that it may have more trouble with uneven terrain than the Cramer one - although finding reviews on these is almost impossible.

What would you guys suggest?"
"First night on duty was a success! (Worx WG794)I bought the Worx WG794 for relatively cheap on Craigslist (USD$380) so I'm taking the risk of having it mow my front lawn. The lawn area is about 3,800 sqft / 350 sqm / 0.1 acres. I live in a high growth area, so I have it set to mow every night. I chose to have it start at 03:30 in the morning, so hopefully it doesn't draw too much attention.

My favorite part about my setup is I have the robot (no name, yet) park head on in between my front shrubbery. This keeps it shaded and out of sight. It just backs up out of the parking space to start mowing!

I thought the overall setup was somewhat easy, though having a newer robot with WiFi/app capability for setup/monitoring would have been nice."
"Flymo easylife missing partHey guys, just finishing setting up my stepdads new flymo easylife lawnmower only to fall at the last hurdle. I am missing a part, the power supply/plug that connects the wall outlet to the cable running from the charging station. No 19 in the picture. Any idea where i can buy a replacement, ive reached out directly to the manufacturer but don’t have a response yet. Any info is appreciated."
"FYI, electricity consumption, not entirely trivialI have been installing smart plugs and sensors to map my energy usage in detail, and since the mowing season is almost upon us, I thought Id also check what my robotic mower uses. And its more than I thought:

https://preview.redd.it/2hmhanpsb8i81.jpg?width=1616&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25c58fe8af99a9652e53080a1980ff20ef093f8f

The base station uses around 5W constantly just to put the signal on the boundary wire, and it does that 24/7/365 even when the mower is charging or powered off. This annoys me, there is no reason to send that signal when the mower is on the base station.

The base station uses an additional \~5W to keep my mower battery topped off. So thats 10W  or 7.2 kWh per month, without any mowing.  (also  annoying, I cant really reduce this through automation, when I turn off the smart plug that powers the base station, the robot wakes up, leaves the base station and then just sits there powered on until the battery is completely drained)

To charge the battery between mowing, well, that will depend on how long and much it mows, but for me,. its roughly 80W during an hour to fully charge. Lets assume 3 such mowing  cycles per day, thats another 7.2 kWh per month. Funny how that works out.

So 14.4 kWh per month in total.  I know some of you will shrug that off, especially if you have US electricity rates. Even with my sky high rates, at 6-7 euro per month, its not that it will bankrupt me, but it uses more power than my home server, more than my freezer and 3x more than my fridge. Not negligible and nearly half of it is completely wasted.

Also, havent dont the math yet, but its probably 10-50x? more than my battery powered  push mower once a week. "
DIY battery replacement and doubling its capacity yields.. well not much due to a software limit
Will we see any new mowers for 2019?It seems that these devices are starting to come into their own. Battery capacity is an issue for me on most of these devices. The 450x is just a bit shy of the area I need to mow. Also are there any smart robots on the horizon? Vacuums are several years ahead of the mowers. 
"Will I regret the Automower 435X?Just moved into our new construction a year ago. Finally started growing some grass and I’m realizing how difficult this lawn will be to cut (much larger and steeper hills than any prior yard) with my push mower. Given the hills (up to 35*) I’m not sure any reasonable riding mower will work. Entire lot is 1.7 acres but probably half is wooded or the house itself and won’t need cut. 

That led me to consider robotic options. Mostly the 435X given the hills. I am a little hesitant. Partially due to price, partially due to perimeter wire. I remember the first few models of robotic vacuums sucked. Random pattern, got stuck, took forever, etc. I’m worried I will be out there all the time rescuing it, fixing the wire, battery won’t last long enough to mow overnight and will interfere will kids playing, etc. 

I don’t see a lot of other options that would work for my yard right now (mows in a pattern, no perimeter wire, can do steep hills, etc). I’d wait until the technology is a little better but I need something for this summer…

Any thoughts or recommendations?"
"I bought a MowRo.I ordered 2 Redback MowRo robotic lawnmowers (front year/backyard), and it's been a nightmare so far.  Here's what happened:

My thought process was that they were affordable, and I could get 2 instead of 1, which is less wear and tear in the long run.

They were delivered on April 15.

MowRo has a professional installation service for $250, so I purchased that because I recently had surgery, and I couldn't install the system for 6 weeks.

The installer came out this past Monday, did not complete the job, and is now a ""no show.""

My impression so far is the company itself is ""winging it"" and doesn't have their shit together.

In terms of MowRo's performance, that has yet to be determined.  I'll update this thread after the installation.

"My robomower is struggling - help!After 2 years of flawless performance, my mower has started to act up. He seems to struggle with bumps he used to previously sail over, gets clogged easily, throws up a bunch of “trapped” errors, spends whole days sitting in one spot with no visible issue in 

Cleaned him loads over the last three days (more than ever before) but I can’t say it helped. I even have the grass a mow using the big mower (which we haven’t used for two years) in an attempt to help robomower along, but I don’t think it’s made any difference. 

sight...

...has anyone encountered erratic behaviour? What ended up helping? I’m at a loss.

Edit: it’s a flymo 1200r, if that helps


Edit2: a battery change fixed everything."
Landscape planning with a robot lawnmowerI'm building a new construction home. I want recommendations on landscaping design considerations and future proofing for robot lawnmowers. I would like to minimize edging requirements. That means doing some kind of edge on the fence. Fencing/zone considerations. Materials and design for transition areas (garden bed to lawn). I think the perimeter/guide wire requirements are pretty clear.

"Using robot mowers in more Rural settings.Can I use the guide wire for a mower to also work as the boudary for an invisible dog fence?

Can I use a hot electric fence as the guide wire? Are there any machines out there that would only cut say, within 1 meter/yard of a single wire electic fence and handle fairly rough terrain (pasture not lawn).

 Electric fences lose their effectiveness when they come in contact with plants. Currently the solution is 1. Chemical herbicides applied regularly along the fencelines. 2. Line trimmers either carried or push mower style. 3. Specialized tractor attachments. These are all fairly time consuming.

Thanks In Advance!"
"Invisible Dog Fence and Robotic MowersI'm in the stage of researching the current options for Robotic mowers. I currently own a Roborock S4 vacuum and it sparked my interest into looking at a similar robot for the yard.

I did a search for the words ""dog fence"" on this sub but couldn't find any posts, so I wanted to know if having an underground invisible dog fence affects a robot mower.

 We don't have the fence on continuously, it's controlled by a light switch (and honestly, the dog is getting to the point where he doesn't need it... lessons learned), but if we decided to leave the fence wire in place, will it interfere with the mower?"
"Flymo 1200r problem after 5 years helpSo I’ve had my 1200r for around 5 years and it’s worked almost flawlessly ever since I installed it. However, randomly today I got a no loop signal error on the mower but no light shown in the base station which is strange. I went into expert mode and it shows all points with no signal. Is this an actual loop error or has the base station got the problem? Base station still charges mower also. Hope someone can help"

"450XHi, I have a 450X 2022 model. Looking for a bit of advice please. The robot starts at the start of the schedule and then goes into charge no problem but doesn't leave when the charge hits 100% and will only leave when I interact with it by pressing park then mow or adjusting grass height or changing some setting off then on. Any help would be much appreciated."
"The problem when I use NavimowI know there should be an open and inclusive attitude towards this type of technology. Just to discuss with you.

1) Sometimes the robot lawn mower can't find the charging base, it keeps wandering near the charging pile. And the charging time is unstable, sometimes it takes 6 hours to fully charge, and sometimes it takes more than 20 hours. I'm annoyed to have to check its check charge status.

&#x200B;

2) I found it often went out of bounds and it wasn't as accurately identified as advertised. I am worried about it.

&#x200B;

3) The app is chaotic. For example, the display of the status of the robot lawn mower and the actual walking route is completely different from the planned one.

&#x200B;

I look forward to you all sharing your thoughts with me"
"RTK Tech in Robot Lawn MowerRTK tech helps the robot lawn mower to locate accurately, therefore, the robot lawn mower can get rid of the perimeter wire. But  RTK signals are easily affected by other signal sources and obstacles. What do you think about RTK tech in Robot Lawn Mower? If there is any other tech that can help a robot lawn mower get rid of the perimeter wire?"

"Help wiring for fence gates and multi zones.Just got WR150 by worx. I have wrought iron fence backyard so trying to find solution to mow backyard and front unless gates shut then just do backyard. I called support and he said unofficially a customer criss crossed wires at gate and if mower got stuck from gate closed it would find the returning line and go back home. If no gate then it would continue on to front yard. 

Next step is automating the gate to let mower in. I see a company patented one that acts like doggy door. Other option would be getting heavy duty automatic gate doors but that is expensive. 

Any help on how to do it is appreciated. I tried myself and it just returned home. 

They said I cant pick up mower and move it to walled off second zone and run it. This would not make it automatic but at least would let me use it to mow whole yard instead of just the back."

"Guide wire issue with Mcculloch Rob 1000Hello, stumbled upon this subreddit and was wondering if anybody might be able to help with an issue that I'm having with my automower. Husqvarna owners/dealers might be able to answer this too since the Rob1000 seems to basically be a 310 but relabeled with a different body and mainly sold in the UK. I have my boundary wire set-up and my guide wire placed. The base station is showing a solid green light, so everything should be good, but the automower doesn't follow the guide wire out to the ""remote"" area as it should. In the picture linked below you can see what I currently have set-up. Blue is the boundary wire, Red is the base station, Solid yellow is where the guide wire is currently laid out (as a test) with dashed yellow where I will eventually run it to once I can get this problem fixed.

Problem: The automower will not follow the guide wire out to the remote area. It will follow the guide wire in from the remote area back to the base station without issue. The automower is set to mow the remote area 100% of the time. Using the ""Test OUT"" function, the automower only following the guide wire out 2-3ft (less than 1m) before stopping and deciding to start cutting the area right in front of it. It should follow the guide wire all the way to the boundary at the other end during this test function.

Note: Due to obstacles such as an AC unit, and a small tree, the narrow area between the house and the front of the property is basically a narrow passage, but the included power cable for the base station will not reach any closer than where I have the base station placed, thus making it the best current spot for the base station, which is part of what makes this slightly challenging to begin with.
