"['Thanks for the review. We have a limited selection in Ireland so I had to get this off Amazon DE and wasn’t willing to fork anything over €1000. The sponsored reviews initially convinced me, particularly from Snazzy Labs, but the fact that there weren’t any non sponsored reviews had me worried until I came across a review of the T10 from Vacuum Wars and it was good, so logically this should be better.\n\nI’ll let you know how i get on. I’m a bit worried because I either read amazing things or terrible things. The main alternatives I am considering are the Dreame L10, the Narwal Freo, and maybe the Roborock S7MV. But to be honest, it seems that they also have their own issues.\n\nFingers crossed!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I don’t have carpets and I’m planning on running this with Kärcher’s cleaning solution.', 'Day 2 Update - \n\nDialling down the object avoidance does seem to have helped a little with it getting around table legs etc. Also I noticed that my garden outside is starting to appear on the map, because the LiDAR can obviously see through my glass doors. However this doesn’t appear to be causing an issue and it still treats the door a wall. But it’s strange and annoying you can’t delete or mark this area as outside in the app. Which brings me onto…\n\nThe app. So far I think this is the weakest part of this system. As I said in my initial comments, it’s not terrible and it could actually be great with a bit of work, but it is frustrating and a bit disappointing at times. For example, you can’t rename areas labels and the choice is limited. Also some of the settings are all over the place and not grouped together in a logical fashion. But by far the biggest issue is that it often doesn’t update the vacs status (so it might say ‘washing the pads’ when it actually started cleaning 5 minutes ago, or it still thinks it on a job when it returned to base ages ago - meaning you can’t edit the maps and cleaning schedules etc). More a bug than design, but needs a force close and restart quite frequently.']"
"['Tile or carpet? All of them are loud as hell on hard surfaces. I have a Roomba i3 and it is LOUD until it goes over carpet and then it isn’t so bad. I also have a Roborock s4 max and it isn’t as loud but is still fairly loud. \n\nOne thing is sometimes the bottom brush needs to wear down a little, the i3 sounded like a freight train for a week. Now it just sounds like commuter rail.']"
"['99% of reviews on YouTube are paid for, so very little criticism or long term testing. I found this out the hard way. The things that it would get caught on was light rugs (the edges get rolled up) and very thing (string) blind cords.', 'What are some trusted sources for reviews? I’ve mostly been watching videos from vacuum wars on YT.']"
"['I’ll post a better ‘review’ in a couple of days. But early impressions mostly good, maybe very good, but not ‘smash it out of ball park’ amazing. It’s a lot more customisable than Roomba in terms of cleaning settings, so still getting my head around what works before for my house. \n\nMy J7+ just couldn’t get my golden retrievers hair off my living room rug, at the most it just rolled it up into clumps, no mater how many passes or what I tried, it just didn’t have the power. Initially I was disappointed with the T20’s performance on the same rug, but after tweaking the settings to deep clean and higher suction etc, the rug is now almost as clean as it is after a manual vac with my Dyson. I’m very pleased about that, if it failed that test it was going back for a Roborock S8. It’s a bit annoying how long it needs to achieve an acceptable clean, but hey as long as I’m not doing it I do really care, it can do it when I sleep or I’m out at work or hiking. And my large-ish (by UK standard) house is mostly tile and oak wood floors, with a couple of low pile rugs. \n\nHowever what I will say is that this is absolutely not a vac for people with mostly carpet. It that’s your house, then don’t even entertain the thought of the T20, this isn’t for you. \n\nThe vac itself has no water tank built in. I’m not yet sure if this is a pro or a con. I can see this approach has a number of possible benefits, but it has to keep going back to the dock to wash and wet the mopping pads (5, 10 or 15 minute intervals). The travel time and cleaning time adds considerable length to the cleaning, as it did this about 4 or 5 times. \n\nBuild quality seems decent, not quite as good as the Roomba in that respect, certainly not what I think it should be for the money, but it’s fine. \n\nThe battery also takes forever to charge. But maybe the J7+ was smaller so seemed quicker. I’m also perhaps being impatient with my new toy. \n\nIt not really fair to say much more at this point, too early. Straight out the box it did miss quite a few spots and simply refused to go a few places that even the stupid J7+ would, which just basically just blundered about smashing into stuff and cleaning under my dining room table was a complete lottery. All my mid century furniture with its many narrow legs probably doesn’t help, I was expecting LiDAR based system to be a bit better at getting through stool legs etc. It also didn’t get close enough to the walls quite frequently. But there is a lot of settings that I think might help with it’s navigation, so I’ll see what changes and tweak can be made before making any definite assessments. \n\nIt could be a keeper with a bit of work, but as I say, I need a few days with it.\n\nActually, I wrote more than I thought I would. Maybe I’ll post this…', ""Thanks for taking the time for this reply. Really useful to get your first impressions, and a really insightful and honest review. \n\nIt's funny - these are big purchases, and we do so much research beforehand, I think it might be impossible to ever be 100% satisfied. But I think you can rationalise keeping it, if it simply does a good enough job to save you £1000 worth of cleaning effort over the lifespan of the product.

"['Its extremely easy to switch back and forth, not an issue at all. And the app has you setup “carpet zones” after it builds your map where it will specifically not go when it has the mop attachment on. I do a regular vacuum first and then a mop run. I mainly do that because my space is large enough that it has to self empty twice in its regular vacuum run so if I just did the combo mode, I’d probably have to manually empty the dust bin in the mop attachment, but also because my rug wouldn’t get vacuumed and it needs it the most. \nWhen the mop attachment is on, it will always vacuum and mop at the same time so I wouldn’t recommend running the mop over carpet. The mop is a lot like a swiffer in the sense that its not going to drench anything and dries fairly quickly, so it wouldn’t be catastrophic if it ran over carpet, just not really a great idea. \n\nIf you want to do a set it and forget it, and wanted to mop once a week, you could have it scheduled to do a vacuum and finish on mop day ahead of time and switch to the mop attachment and empty the bin since you need to do that anyways. \n\nAlso, someone can correct me, but I’m not sure theres a full sensor on the dock that alerts you anywhere when its full. Its got a clear little window and I think thats all you get. The robot does call out errors though and theres probably one for if it can’t self empty.

Having two will allow the bots to circle inner corners clockwise and counter-clockwise, and this could help where mapping is an issue, or with dumber bump-n-rotate robots.\n\nThe rollers will be flow rate (CFM) limited, so having more wouldn't help much, and only add to power consumption.\n\nNice vids.

Both their vacuums and robots do a great job of cleaning - but the regular vacuums are not crippled by terrible app and software/firmware implementation.  I started with Shark robots (and haven\'t used anything else) since the 700 series - they were dumb, and they worked.  But anything that relies on the SharkClean app seems to be absolute garbage.  It ignores my No-Clean zones completely - they\'re set up properly, and customer service just said ""try remapping"", will not/can not find a room (out of dozens of attempts, never once has it found the room I asked it to), and the app is unstable and crashes on three separate devices I\'ve tried it on.  I\'ve remapped 4 times, every map *looked* reasonable, but completely non-functional for any usable purpose.  The most recent one I purchased (IQ series, I think model RV1001?) is now about 3 months old, and I should have returned it - but I\'m past my return window.

"['I\'m new to this sub, but no matter how you sort its feed there are an awful lot of problem posts related to the Shark brand. If I was to buy right now it would be from the iLife brand for their use of newer technologies and an app that\'s more configurable than their competitors (for example, Uoni\'s app is usable, but doesn\'t give you any control over the mapping, room naming, room ordering, or even the creation of room partitions. Grr...)\n\nYour home\'s exterior is already visible on Google Earth and Street View, and all of the information about bedroom and bathroom counts, the size of the garage, the presence or absence of a laundry room, etc. is already very public information. Run a web search for ""information about <your address>"" to see this for yourself. Using just these two things anyone can already guess the interior layout of your home with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nI\'m highly wary of anything that claims to be free of hair clogging. It happens to anything and everything from sinks and tubs to upright vacuums. There is no magic way to escape this while collecting it. I clean our unit\'s roller, brushes, and filter weekly.\n\nThe cost of bags for things like a big collection bin are negligible, like $2-4/month even with your dog. It\'s not worth entirely avoiding a purchase for this, but I would not be so accepting of any bags on the vacuum itself.\n\nFor going between floors, this usually requires restoring to a different map within the related app each time you change floors. This can become tedious enough that many folks end up with a second device for the second floor.\n\nDefinitely go for a vacuum + mop combo. The mopping piece is usually a gravity fed, non-moving attachment, so it\'s not something that gets broken easily. You need to fill its reservoir each time, clean its pad off after each use, and replace its pad sometimes. A nice spare parts kit for these devices can be had around $25, and they will come with some of these pads, extra side brushes and hepa filters, etc. The life of all these things is from many weeks to many months, so it doesn\'t cost much at all to keep them going. As for dedicated mopping robots, the reviews of them all say that they clean at a level consistent with a Swiffer Wet Jet without any added pressure. That\'s exactly what the reviews of these combo units say. Additionally, most of the dedicated moppers are not very intelligent while many of these vacuums use lidar and AI to get things done efficiently and smartly.\n\nI would buy new for two reasons. You already mentioned warranties, and you\'re right that most of them are a year, some two. However, if you get it from Amazon it only costs around $35 to extend the base warranty out to 3 years through their partner, Asurion, sold right through Amazon like any other listing. The other reason I\'d buy new is that many of us buy these vacuums because we\'ve been too busy or sick to keep with the cleaning. This means that there\'s a high chance that any returned units have already done some heavy duties, and then you\'d have nothing but the manufacturer\'s warranty to back it up.']"

"['Sorry for the long read, but hope this helps!\n\nSo I bought the S9+ for upstairs last week since it’s 100% medium-high pile carpet. Let me tell you this, it’s does the same if not better job than a corded vacuum. I have 2 cats and when the play, they get aggressive and you will see literally patches of fur everywhere, every day. With my back issues I’m only able to vacuum once a week, until I bought the S9! Now I run it every 2-3 days and my upstairs is perfectly clean.\n\nMy steam mop went out for downstairs last weekend as well (what a coincidence, right? Lol), and I decided to purchase the Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra since it’s 100% tile downstairs. Just ran it yesterday and boy am I happy with it!\n\nSo the con of s9 is that the mapping just sucks, and it’s pretty much useless for me. But it still is able to clean all rooms upstairs within an hour even with it’s shitty mapping system. But on the bright side, no other robot vacuum will come close to this for pure carpet cleaning (at least for now).\n\nThe Roborock has excellent mapping, literally mapped my whole downstairs in like 10 minutes. I don’t really have any complaints so far with the Roborock. I love the Roborock so much that I’ve been researching in finding one for upstairs so I can return my s9 and have a Roborock for carpet as well. But unfortunately after some research, I’ve found the roborock’s don’t perform that well on carpets, especially medium-high pile carpets. And for that reason I will keep my S9 for upstairs and my S7 Maxv Ultra for downstairs!', ""No, this was very helpful - Thank you! \n\nSince my upstairs is all carpet, I decided to go Roomba for now. I got a refurb i7, which has worked very well so far. Like you said, the mapping isn't fantastic, but the cleaning is good -- it doesn't quite replace a regular vacuum but helps keep up during the week. I like that I can move it downstairs too and start a job too.\n\nEventually, I'd like to get a roborock for the downstairs, but that'll have to wait a bit.""]"
"[""I purchased both the Roomba S9+ (bundle version with M6 Braava mop) and the Roborock S7  MaxV Ultra at the same time to test them out.  Both are great vacuums.  Ultimately, I returned the Roomba and kept the Roborock.  A few reasons why...\n\n1. I wanted mop functionality. Although I got the iRobot M6 Braava, it just didn't do a good job... It would take forever and just slam into things. The Roborock does a much better job at mopping and it also autocleans the mop and auto refills the water tank.\n2. Roborock has much more advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance than the S9/M6 combo.  With the built in sensors, the Roborock did a better job navigating around shoelaces, extension cords, and pet toys.  While the Roomba would just drive right over them. Roborock also has no problem navigating in a dark room, while the Roomba you have to keep the lights on.\n3. Sound... The S9 is loud, while the Roborock seems to be a bit quieter.\n4. Vacuum performance - This is a toss up.  95% of my floor is hard floor, and the rest is high pile carpet.  I also have a siberian husky who sheds a ton of hair.  Both vacuums got the job done perfectly in this scenario, although I'd have to give the slight edge to the Roomba S9 which does a better job in edge and corner cleaning. In addition, the S9 is supposed to do a better job in low pile carpet. \n5. RGB camera - Because I have a dog.  If I'm not home, the Roborock S7 MaxV has a built in camera and remote control where I can control the vacuum and watch through the camera from my phone.  This is handy when I want to check in on my dog when he's home alone.\n\nLike another poster said... If you can hold out, Roborock is about to release their S8 Pro Ultra in a couple of months which features dual rollers like the Roomba for better vacuum performance.  If you can hold out even longer, they will likely release the S8 MaxV Ultra sometime next year which will be the successor to the S7 MaxV (which adds the RGB camera over the S8 Pro)."", 'If you can manage to hold yourself back from making a purchase for the next few months you\'ll be able to see review videos of Roborock\'s new S8 Ultra. Given the new upgrades to the roller brush assembly it\'s likely that we will see very similar carpet performance as found on current Roomba vacs. \n\nAlternatively, I\'d tell you to go with S7 MaxV hands down. You don\'t have pets, and so the S7 will be far more than adequate because you are all it has to keep up with, plus you get the benefits of the mopping feature and a newer robo vac than the S9. If you had a German Shepherd like myself, then I\'d be telling you to get the Roomba instead. \n\nIt\'s overkill only depending on how you look at it. Even if everyone in the house doesn\'t mind mopping and vacuuming, everyone is still going to love the fact that the S7 ultra mops and vacs. My parents for instance? They couldn\'t dream of having a robot vacuum because they thought along a similar line as you: is it overkill?\n\n""Oh we don\'t need that. We don\'t want one. They\'re expensive. Blah blah blah.""\n\nWell guess what, they love it now, and they don\'t for a second miss the vacuuming they had to do previously, and they certainly don\'t give a damn about what it cost. They vacuum twice a month now instead of 1-2 times per week.']"
"['To date, I don\'t believe there\'s any one article or video that could be pointed to because it falls under ""okay, all robo vac owners should see this"". \n\nObviously, any product out of China should be probably be looked at with a higher degree of skepticism, however the most likely issue is a camera/microphone data leak, but that can occur with domestic vacs all the same, so. \n\nIsolating the vac on it\'s own network is a good idea. \n\nSs far as floorplans go, I mean there could be a whole range of reasons from paranoid to ""okay you\'ve got my attention"".\n\nGiven that fact that most people carry a smartphone of some kind now, everyone is already a walking sensor platform at this point. All the sensitive information that they think is going to be scooped up by a robot vacuum can be, and likely already has been, obtained elsewhere through some other means. The addition of a robot vac IS a potential weak point, and it IS another sensor platform, so I\'ll give credit to their concerns, but I sincerely doubt we\'ll ever see robot vacuums become a problem on a level that really needs to be addressed beyond using measures such as quarantining them to a network with nothing else on it. \n\nNow with all that being said, I\'ll bet my bank account there\'s probably a whole floor full of corporate backed scumbags tasked with the singular mission of imagining new ways that the data collected by robot vacs - however minimal it may be - can be used to suck more money out of people, or perfect their planned obsolescence.']"

The air jet really does make a difference in corners, like huge. It only works for hard floors, but was genuinely surprised how well it did. Wouldn't be shocked to see other companies follow along.\n\nInstead of no go zones we bought a large silicone mat on Amazon with raised edges that works pretty good for food and water bowls. The raised edges are sufficient to trigger the bump sensor and avoids any potential for running over water, plus we like that we just pick the whole thing up off the floor to clean it instead of having to mop the floor frequently (dogs a messy eater)."", ""I'm sorry, I can't promise you never lol\n\nThe reality is that any robot you buy will still have the potential to get stuck. Almost weekly I see comments from owners of top dollar robot vacuums getting themselves into trouble. Paying a premium won't fully guarantee that it will never get stuck, but it will decrease the chances of it happening. \n\nWith that being said, every house is different. Your cat toys might be different, your shoes, the length of your charging cords, etc etc etc, so where as some people say they have no issue with theirs getting stuck, your items may just be different enough that you'll encounter the issues. It's stupid little things like that still happen even with the top dollar robot vacuums.\n\nClearly this calls for object recognition which means an onboard camera system, and the two best right now are Roomba and Roborock.

We really do love ours given the fact it's their newest model with upgraded mapping and performance, and both can be had for 300-600 a piece depending on renewed or bought factory sealed.\n\nHope this helped.

"[""1 Need budget\n\n2 Do you want the low medium or high on the features scale\n\n3 Will pets be present? If yes, do you anticipate the possibility of your pets having an accident on the floor?\n\n4 Are we talking just debris that's been tracked in? Or are we talking the occasional screw here and there? Rags and other debris/objects of a similar size?\n\nDont really need you to respond to these questions, but I gave you my thoughts and hopefully in a way that you can use to define your needs.\n\n1 - Personally, my budget for this specific job would be 150-300 and I would buy refurbished. Amazon frequently has excellent deals on renewed shark vacuums that you can slap an additional 2-3 year warranty on for like $30-40. Woot also has great deals on renewed sharks every few months. Two of mine are refurbs and one was direct from Shark -- they all do a great job.\n\n2 - again for this specific job, I'd go for low features. Basic lidar navigation, generally good reviews, smart home integration, auto emptying base (absolute must), decent object avoidance. Again, I'd point you to Shark.\n\n3 - I don't have a worry about pet accidents in the garage, but if I did then I'd probably be looking at a top of the range Roborock or Roomba. They have onboard cameras to recognize pet accidents and avoid them. Anything without the ability to recognize pet accidents will drive right through it, spread it ALL over, suck a bunch of it into its guts, and this is all presuming the robot doesn't die right on the spot. \n\n4 - My garage is pretty clean. Has the occasional screw, but never a stray rag or anything like that. I don't have a vac out there yet, but when it's time to replace the vac inside the house then it will be moved to the garage. My current vac won't avoid any cords, socks, rags etc, so it will find the rag and likely jam, or likely just carry it around until it's done cleaning. I suspect that a screw of sufficient size may cause the robot to jam, thus requiring you to intervene, but I don't think it will jam every time it finds a screw. \n\nIf you're satisfied with the answers given, then you'd be fine with a newer model shark (anything that has AI Ultra in the name)(please confer with me before you buy a shark, the way they named their robots is stupid and it easily confuses a lot of people).\n\nMy two models:\n UR2500SR \n RV2502AE (this variant uses a jet of air to clean corners -- much more effective than robots that don't use this) \n\nI love both of them and can't find anything to complain about. Completely integrated and automated into my smart home, keeps the floors near 100% clean, and damn near forget it even exists lol. From my perspective, it appears that most of the people you see complaining about sharks are restricted mostly to older models, or what appears to be complaints from people who might have frequent issues with technology lol.\n\nIf not satisfied by the answers given, then you're looking at something a bit more expensive. Roomba, for instance, will avoid the pet mess as well as most objects, but at a premium. Same story for Roborock.\n\nMakita makes a robot vacuum intended for shop applications, so there's little to no worrying about what happens when a screw is thrown onto the floor. It's extremely expensive for what it is tho, and for that kind of money you could buy a top of the line roborock that's absolutely amazing for your house but extreme overkill for your garage.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to fire questions back\n\nEdit: another user mentioned oil spills from vehicles, this needs to go into your decision making. If any liquid spills factor into potential hazards in your garage, then the vac needs to have onboard AI (cameras) to see and then avoid the mess. Otherwise, same story as with pet mess."", ""Okay so given the updated details I'd have to say that you're pretty much just as informed as the rest of us when it comes to garage specific vacs like the Makita.\n\nIn other words your guess is as good as ours as to it's performance, let alone reviews.\n\nPebbles are probably fine up to right around like a quarter inch in height. Probably not really what roborock was intending and an S7 to pickup lol, but I do think that when you're ready to retire your vacs in the house that they'll do okay in the garage, sort of.\n\nReally it's going to depend on the size and shape of your leaves, but if they appear that they're something that the S7 would hoover up then yeah it's probably fine.\n\nFor the sports car you're probably going to want to set no go zones just to be safe and remove any potential of the robot getting anywhere near it.\n\nThe only thing that stood out to me as potentially being a hurdle is the water on the floor from condensation or ice melting off the car.\n\nIt's my understanding that the S7 probably doesn't play as well with pools of water on the floor as any other vac, which is why everything that has to do with water usually occurs behind the the vacuum inlet / roller assembly. \n\nExample: \n\n-you get home on a snowy day and everyone's piling out of the car with their wet and muddy boots\n\n-there's debris on the floor that should probably be vacuumed before a mopping run occurs, but there's also water all over the floor that the vacuum will suck up prior to mopping (not good) \n\nThis one issue alone pretty much has me ruling out every vac I can think of. I have no idea if the Makita can handle something like that. I know it's design was centered around it being used in shop-like conditions, but I don't know if it plays well with water."", 'Yea.  It seems like water mitigation may be a concern.  I have heated floors, and a slight ramp up to the garage, and very little snow but loads of rain.  So the floors should not get crazy wet, but wetter than the robots are normally used to.\n\nI suppose if I program them to run at 5:00 AM or something, the floors would be at their dryest, which might help as well.  I could even program the floors to be a few degrees hotter during the night to aid in drying.   The floors warm at about 1 degree per hour, though, so that may not help a lot, but is something.  I could also program the robots to self clean at a very high frequency to handle the dirt and water load better.\n\nI think you and I have gone through the same thinking process in general here.', 'When I post directly to a sub, I probably spend 1/2 hour writing it out, trying to make the perfect post that folks will not hate me for that is maximally relevant to the sub and helpful to others, yet will still hopefully meet my needs.

"[""Have a similar issue with a couple floor lamps. Thankfully there are only two and they're also in corners, which means I can make very tiny no-go zones (will attempt to attach a pic).\n\nAdditionally, the bot had trouble recognizing thin and/or low obstacles. It might be a pain for some people depending on how many objects in their house they'll have to do this for, but I was able to tape pieces of cardboard around the objects that it wasn't detecting during the mapping run. You're just increasing the height of thickness of the obstacle via the cardboard so that the lidar will register it properly as an obstacle.\n\nI ran several tests where I would map a room with a box placed in the center of the room, and then I'd remove the box when starting the cleaning run. Each time, the bot would avoid the area where the box previously was despite it's path being clear.\n\nLong story short, it remembers where stuff is, even if the object is gone. In theory, you may be able to able my cardboard hack to your stool pedestals.\n\n\nCan't really offer much guidance on the creating rooms portion of your complaint.

They occasionally get stuck on these things and need to be \'rescued\'.\n\nAs for objects in their path, my Shark robots (AI w/Lidar) do a decent job (not always perfect) of avoiding anything consistently higher than 3 inches.  Angled or slanted objects will cause them angst, as they can\'t ""see"" (and thus don\'t try to avoid) any part of the object that is below the 2.8-inch tall mark - but, even in these cases, they are usually successful at finding their way around the obstruction.\n\n(BTW if you want to see some of the navigation tools of your robot, use a digital or cell-phone camera to watch them crawl around a moderately-dark room.  Some of the signals they send out will be visible on the camera.)']"

Cats in my experience will take it out on you.  We don't have cats now but used to have 5 at one time.  When we brought home our Carin Terrier who insisted on using the cats litter box boy did we pay for that.\n\nAs for the bot itself look for one that not only is good with hair but one that's very good at picking up things similar to litter.

"[""Your floor type(s) should play a role in your decision making.\n\nEach floor of my house is one specific type of floor.\n\nThese days, virtually anything you get starting at $350 is pretty much a guarantee that it will completely clean your hard floors. For carpet, it's another story. Roomba still seems to hit the top of the charts as far as carpet performance, but not all carpet is created equally so you may find that Roomba doesn't do any better than it's competitor. \n\nWe have three Sharks and they each have only one type of floor to deal with.\n\nx1 UR2500SR.

Again, anything over a certain price point and your hard floors are basically guaranteed clean. For our carpets, it doesn't do an amazing job, but it does however do a good enough job that we are happy we have it. Our German shepherd leaves little hairballs on the carpet (our primary annoyance -- stray dog hair being the 2nd in line) and it has no issue with that. Stray hairs performance isn't great, but again we're still happy. We still break out the upright vac 1-2 times per week, but that's partly driven by the fact that no robot vac on the market really stands up to an upright as far as just shear ability to pull particulate & dog hair from carpet. They're getting there, but not yet.\n\nScheduling/app -- the app is poor, I'll say that flat out. That being said, I don't use the app to control the robot at all because I have google control all the scheduling and in what rooms. The shark app won't let you schedule in the way you're hoping, but linking it to Google will allow you exactly what you're wanting to do.\n\nThey're good (enough) vacs and we really are happy with them, however I wouldn't suggest you pay full retail for any Shark. Not ever. If you're going to spend 500-600 bucks on one new robot, 100% spend it on a Roborock or Roomba. \n\nTwo of our Sharks are refurbs from Amazon/Woot ($189 awesome Woot deal & $250 regular Amazon price), and our 3rd was a Black Friday deal we ended up getting completely free. Slapped a 2-3 year warranty from Amazon on each for $30-40 each. Point being, you can keep the whole thing to within about $450 if you look around.

Hair does get wrapped around the ends of the brush fairly often,  but it is easy enough to clean out. Unlike the Roborock app, you can not see real time where your bot is. This has not been a deal breaker for me though. The app works for basic functions such as scheduled cleanings.  Obstacle avoidance is good with the Shark. Our area is about 1000sq ft.

We have one in the basement and one on the main floor, both of which are all hard floors.

"['Vacuum Wars is pretty good for reviews.  There are other worthy YouTube reviewers as well, though I don\'t know them off hand to recommend.\n\nMy past experience was with older gen Roombas which were not very smart, bounced around like drunks, but still got the job done.  The newer stuff from everyone is much better.   I now have a pair of Roborock SV Max Ultras which are about as expensive as it gets, but I really like them.  I bought mine on Black Friday for about $1K each, though they are normally about $1400 ish.  Price may come down with the S8 coming out, maybe, and the S8 may or may not be better, I don\'t know yet.\n\nMopping is adequate.  It does the job of removing the little drip dots that get on the floor in daily use.  I have not tried it for larger spills, but I expect it is better to handle those by hand.\n\nNavigation is quite good.  [I have mine hidden away in cupboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/10kdn6k/hidden_robot_dock_in_cabinetry/), and they find their way back to wash and charge there nicely.  Sometimes they will snag a loose cord, they like to ""hump"" my 1/2"" steel bars at the bottom of my coffee tables, and they are confused by floor to ceiling windows.  Luckily, it is reasonably easy to use the app to add ""no go zones"" in the problem areas, and then just touch up those spots by hand once in a while.\n\nThe auto-empty bins are really nice.  I get maybe 3 or 4 cleaning cycles on the water before I need to dump the gray water and refill the fresh water (about 1 liter).  It does require magic potion at an extra expense, which I think is there to keep mold away and maybe aid in cleaning a little.  Luckily a big bottle lasts a long time, since you only need a tiny bit per load.  The vacuum also auto-empties, and I have yet to have to service that, though my house is new and very low dust already.\n\nCleaning job is pretty good.  It seems to get everything I have needed it to do.\n\nThe software is very good.  It has a few very minor quirks and annoyances, but I have yet to feel frustrated or that I couldn\'t get it to do what I needed it to do.   The mapping is amazing, but if you are using the same robot for multiple floors, it can get a little confused in auto-detecting where it is if the floors look similar.\n\nIt can handle a 1/4"" threshold fine.  A 1/2"" threshold maybe sometimes.  I don\'t know how it will do with a sunken living room, other than you will have to probably just hand move it there like it is a separate floor.  I think it will do fine with that, even given the mapping auto-detect issue I mentioned earlier.\n\nIt has a ""cliff sensor"" which should prevent it from diving into the sunken area.  That will almost certainly work, but in the off chance it does not, you can just specify that as a ""no go"" area in the app.\n\nIt should be fine with baby stuff, as it does a pretty good job of navigating around shoes and toys and such.  It is not perfect, though, so does sometimes drag a shoelace or cord.  It has a special mode to be extra careful about detecting poo, which I have not tried since I don\'t have pets.  Many robots get stuck with hair tangles, which may still be an issue with the Roborock, but I have not yet had any issue other than a quick hair cleaning when servicing the water tanks.\n\nAlexa integration was pretty easy.  I just noticed them as new devices in the Alexa app.  This gives you the power to start and stop the robot and return home, but not to specify a specific zone to clean through Alexa.  However, through the app, you can specify it to clean only certain zones, which is nice if you have an entryway that tends to be needed to clean much more often than the rest of the area, and similar.\n\nI should also mention that for some hardwood / vinyl to carpet transitions it handles them very well, including the tassels of my India rug.  however, for one of my rugs it just pushes up the edge, which is kind of annoying, so I put a no-go zone there.  I suppose some carpet tape to hold it down might help.', 'I agree on Vaccum Wars as a good reliable review site', 'I own two Roborocks, an S6 and S7.

If it's at the end of the run when it finds the mess, it won't be so bad, but it will still suck. Additionally, the robot is going to suck all of that into its guts and you'll have a terrible time cleaning it, and that's if the robot didn't already destroy itself in the process.\n\nPoint being, Roomba and Roborock are two reputable brands that have trained the AI recognition on their robots to detect animal accidents and avoid them.\n\nIf you don't have these concerns, then I'd tell you to go low.

I think Botslab is reasonably priced at the functions and performances.\n\nOne thing I feel a little confusing is its app, it has tons of features, I have to dive into them.

This yeedi needs the lights on, which was something new to me. It\'s fine though, I have the smart lights turn on when it\'s scheduled to clean in the middle of the night.\n\nI need the vacuum to easily go over two cords (which the yeedi is doing perfectly. My roomba had a hard time with them.) Other than that, my floor is naturally picked up (no kids, no pets.)\n\nNone of these last 4 things are deal breakers or massive selling points. I need self emptying and mapping with a ~$350 budget. I have a hard time bending over so I don\'t want to have to bend over, pick up the vacuum, and empty the bin everyday.

So we\'ll have to go with a camera-based one, which really narrows the options.\n\nHowever, given your experience with Yeedi (you already know the app, etc) I\'d say the best thing would be to stay with Yeedi (as long as - aside from room splitting - your experience with your current bot was satisfactory).\n\nIn your case, even though it\'s slightly more expensive than your budget, the ideal solution is the successor of your current model, which is Yeedi Vac 2 Pro, plus the Yeedi Self-Emptying Station sold separately.\n\nThe Yeedi Vac 2 Pro is extremely similar to your model but with a few differences, which are: \n\n- it no longer has a floor tracking sensor (the large circular hole you see on the bottom of your bot, opposite side to the side brush)\n\n- it has a new mopping module that actively ""scrubs"" the floor by vibrating the mop pad\n\n- it has a new front laser 3D sensor that helps with obstacle avoidance (can be enabled/disabled in the app, so if you see in case when it\'s enabled the robot is too much ""careful"" and misses some spots, then you can disable it and it should behave the same as your current bot)\n\n- it has a few new software features in the app (make sure you update the firmware first thing after you configure it in the app), most notably multi-floor support (so you can save the map of multiple house levels, up to 3 if I remember correctly) and **editable rooms** (you can manually split/merge rooms in case the bot doesn\'t automatically get them right)\n\nAside from the above, everything else is 99% the same as your current bot.\n\nThe self-emptying station that is sold separately for the Vac 2 Pro, is the exact same model that you have for your current vacuum.\n\nThe RRP for the Yeedi Vac 2 Pro is $449, and for the optional self-emptying station $199 (tot. $650).\n\nHowever, the bot is currently on sale on the Yeedi website, *bundled with the self-emptying station*, for $440: https://www.yeedi.com/products/yeedi-vac-2-pro?variant=42771588415645\n\nThere are other options for a lower price, but their quality is awful. \n\nA few other options with similar/better quality do exist within your budget ($350), but require you to sacrifice the max 3.75"" height requirement as they\'re all laser-based.\n\nAmong those, the first choice would be Dreame D10 Plus: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VKZT1FQ (96.3mm, ~3.79"" tall, RRP $399 but currently available with a $50 off coupon, so tot. $350 as per your budget).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit:\n\n> ldeally, l\'d be able to say, ""Alexa, vacuum the entry way."" She\'d vacuum the entry way and then go back to the base.\n\nThis (voice commands for room-level cleaning) unfortunately I believe is not available for any of the robots within or slightly above your budget.

I've had them for around 3 years with no prior issues.  Tried customer service and the standard troubleshooting instructions several times, no luck.  Different phones, tons of reboots all around, turn off 5.0, etc.  Even tore down one to the motherboard to see if somehow I fried something or maybe find a hidden factory reset button/battery.  And no luck.  Tried hacking directly to a port.  No luck.  Although the Hello World page is strange.  If you've tried this you know what I am talking about.  Then on desperation I re-setup the old 2.4 router to see if I could get them to reconnect.  And yes, no luck.  Then I got to wondering, what if I factory reset the old router and lost all my old WiFi customizations.  Maybe that might work since I know the robots have had a number of firmware upgrades, but I never had to re-setup with the WiFi, right?  Well, that worked.  Then I got to thinking I wonder if one of the issues isn't just the 2.4, but maybe it didn't like the SSID of the updated mesh setup.  So I switched the SSID of the old system to the new one and the sharks wouldn't connect.  The principal difference between the SSID names was the factory default on the old router was 1 word.  I used 2 words, including a space, in the new setup (on both the new and the old router).  So then I just changed the name on the old 2.4 router to 1 word.  All 3 then connected easy peasy to the old 2.4 router.  then I turned them all off, disconnected the old router and re-setup the mesh using the same exact SSID and password.  Turned the sharks back on, and they immediately connected to the mesh system.  So from what I can gather, at least the older models I have don't just limit their setup dislike to multiband systems, they also don't like SSIDs that use multiple words ( most likely they don't like spaces in SSID names, and I didn't use any special characters so no idea if that could present an issue).

It seemed to have a lot of remarkable features for a product priced at 300$. The downside has been the lack of reviews. I’ve been doing some research and it almost comes across as if the product is there but the marketing is not. The downsides of course are the lack of auto emptying as well as item detection. At the end of the day, I am not looking for a robot vac that scrubs my floors from top to bottom, but rather a vac that helps me maintain the cleanliness of my floors on days that I’m at work.', 'I completely understand your need, and also to have been impressed by the features. I\'m happier than a pig in s*** to see that a bunch of cool features have now basically become standard on all robot vacuums above the $300-$400 mark.\n\nAlrighty, my analysis:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IxlA1Jan2Mg\nWant you to watch this - scrub to 17:05 and press play (want you to look at the inside of the bin)\n\nHardwood and pet hair:\nIt appears that this robot seems to do just fine on hardwood/tile floors with respect to pet hair, and virtually all robots these days do an excellent on hardwood/tile floors in general. That video seems to show it had no problem even with long pet hair, and the guy seemed happy, however in the few review videos I was able to find none where they showed or talked about if the roller gets clogged up periodically with long hair. Another thing about the bin is that for long pet hair, it may fill faster than you expect and cause you to empty it far more often OR, you may not have that issue at all.\n\nCarpet:\nPet hair on carpet + robot vacuums, are like cats and dogs -- eternal enemies lol. They all do great on hardwood, then they all start to fall off to varying degrees when it comes to carpet because not all pet hair and not all carpets are created equally. Roomba is probably the best scoring brand when it comes to it\'s ability to clean carpet. Then, it\'s a gradual decline on carpet performance as you run across the competing brands in their price bracket. This vac has pet in the name, so one can assume that good results at picking up pet hair was one of the primary design influences. It may do alright on carpet, it may do porky on carpet. Generally, unless it\'s a Roomba or something very similar like a Roborock, I automatically assume that the vac will perform ""just ok"" on carpet. They aren\'t quite there yet to stack up against an upright vacuum on carpet. Soon, but not yet.\n\nI\'ll be honest with you, these days I really can\'t recommend a robot vacuum without an auto empty dock. To me it\'s like selling you a new car, but without any tires. Not the best example, but I think you catch my meaning.\n\nMy entire life is focused around saving as much as time as possible when it comes to things I do not enjoy doing -- vacuuming happens to be on that list. My house is too big and has too many floors for us to continue vacuuming and sweeping almost every day just to keep up with the dogs. \n\nHow does this matter to you? Well, I haven\'t had to vacuum or sweep our hardwood/tile floors once since we got ours. I mean it, not once. Once a week I\'ll walk around with the upright vacuum to hit the corners and baseboards, but I\'m completely done in 3 minutes and that\'s all I have to do. The floors are immaculate and I can confidently walk around the house barefoot without risking stepping on dog cookie crumbs that blend perfectly with my hardwood floors lol. We don\'t have one upstairs where all the carpet is -- thankfully the dogs spend most of their time on the lower floors so we can still get away with vacuuming once a week upstairs. Not sure yet about how mine would do on carpet, but I might get another one just to see because we really are pleased with ours on the lower levels.\n\nVacs without an auto empty dock require you to be in the loop much more than for those with one. These things were designed to alleviate us from having to do these chores anymore, and having to empty the tiny bin on the robot multiple times per week is just something I\'m completely disinterested in doing. I want to forget about it for weeks on end, and I do thanks to the auto empty. If you\'re fine with emptying the bin on the robot every day or every other day, then by all means I want you to buy this vacuum because I understand what a nuisance it can be when you just want to come home to a clean house.\n\nI\'m not trying to talk you out of this one, just want you to be up to speed when you make your decision.\n\nI\'m seriously happy with my Shark UR2500SR, and my Shark RV2502AE (30 and 60 day bin, respectively).\n\nThey are within your price range if:\n\n-you find a sale\n\nOr\n\n-you\'re okay with going refurbished\n\nAmazon frequently has both models in stock as refurbished (about $250-400 depending on the model). Both of them will have a bunch of cool features that I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy. I\'m completely hands off with mine -- I empty it once or twice a week (can go much longer) and that\'s it. Once a month they get put on the counter and cleaned, and I\'m DONE lol.\n\nMine looked brand new, and probably was, but because it was a return they couldn\'t sell it as new again. They come with a 90 day warranty, but I slapped a 3 year parts warranty on it for like 30-40 bucks at checkout and I haven\'t regretted it once. It may not cover absolutely everything, but ebay is littered with spare parts if I want to go down that route.\n\nI know this was long, but hope it helped somehow. Lemme know if I can clarify anything for you.']"
"['Still pondering and researching this. In my searches, I came across the Hobot Legee 7, which is a vacuum mop combination, and regarding long human hair, one of the design features is a vacuum without any roller at all.\n\nThere are two factors holding me back from buying it, however:\n1. It didn\'t get a very good score on ProductReview.com.au. Whilst ""on paper"", as per marketing material, it\'s really good for my needs, people reported a lot of issues, and I am getting the impression it\'s not very reliable.\n2. It\'s not sold my many retailers, and there doesn\'t appear to me much material online about it, in particular on youtube, and also it\'s not mentioned at all on the Vacuum Wars website. I get the impression this brand/model isn\'t a major player (but I could be wrong).\n\nAre there any models of robot vacuums (I.e. Roborock, Kogan, iRoomba, Eufy, etc, etc) that enable operation with the main roller brush after it\'s been removed? I know a lot of models allow for easy removal of the main brush (for cleaning and replacing), but can the robot operate without the roller brush re-inserted?\n\nI am guessing the robot will throw an error message and cease to operate if the main roller hasn\'t been re-inserted? Has anyone tried this?']"
"['Shark RV2502AE 60 day bin\n\nShark UR2500SR 30 day bin\n\nBoth can be found refurbished on Amazon, about 350 for the RV and about 250 for the UR. I just got the notification last night that these were back in stock. They are the same thing, just difference in bin capacity.\n\n(Have to enter model number into Amazon search bar followed by renewed to find it easily)\n\nI\'ve two dogs (pitbull and German shepherd) and all my floors are either hardwood or tile.\n\nI haven\'t swept or vacuumed once since I got the vacs. I mean I guess that\'s not entirely true, about once a week I\'ll break out the upright vacuum and just get the stuff along the baseboards and in the corners that robot failed to reach.  My point is that the robot has been so thorough and left so little behind in the places it couldn\'t reach, that I only have to walk around once a week for like 3 minutes with the vacuum to hit corners & baseboards and I\'m done. Mind you, this is based on the unique characteristics of my house, you may find you need to vacuum more often simply because your pets may shed more, you may track in a little more dirt than we do, etc etc -- I just don\'t want you thinking that it\'ll be exactly the same for you as it is for me.  \n\nThis has all the features you want, and at an extremely competitive price when factoring in the discounts.\n\nI seriously love mine. It does everything you\'ve asked for it to do in your OP.\n\nI use Google automations and Google voice commands instead of the Shark app to completely control the robot. Google will let you set multiple schedules per day, where as the shark app will not. Google woke the vacuum up 5 mins ago and it\'s doing it\'s morning whole house run. \n\nMake a new mess in the kitchen after the robot has already cleaned your house in the morning? \n""Hey Google clean the kitchen"".\n\nIt\'s still on my to-do list to see if I can have google set the power level for each run.\nExample: high-power run when we\'re away, low-power run for a quick trip around the house before bed\n\nHasn\'t gotten stuck or confused once in my house, found every room on the first mapping run and I haven\'t needed to touch it once aside from emptying the dust bin inaide the base station. \n\n\nLove it, can\'t recommend it enough to people, especially those with mostly or only hard floors.']"

"['I really should get paid for this lol\n\n\nOkay so,\n\nRoborock has similar names to the Roomba. What the logic was behind choosing a name almost exactly like their competition.. you got me bud.\n\nRoborock has the S6, S7 and now the S8 in just a few months. It will be marginally better than the S7, however for your specific needs as it concerns no pets, carpet etc etc, the S7 will have you tickled pink.\n\nRoomba I believe has the S7 and S9, but no S8. You still with me lol? Both are very good, they just lack functionality for the price you\'re paying compared to their competitors.\n\n---------------------------\n\nOne floor, no pets, and it sounds like no carpet as well?\n\nIf no carpet, then you\'re going to be pleased with whichever option you go with. My Sharks do absolutely excellent on my hardwood floors, and Shark is basically the cheapest option I would recommend to anyone.\n\nRoomba seems to score better on carpet, but you can write that one off because no carpet. The Roomba and Neato WILL do better in corners than Roborock because of the D shaped design. With that being said, while the robots are really close to getting to 100%, none of them will completely remove you from vacuuming/mopping. Whether that\'s still once a week, or two or three weeks up to you. I haven\'t had to vacuum the floors once since I\'ve got mine, but I still walk around once a week just to get the corners and the baseboards, and I\'m usually done in about 3 minutes now lol.\n\nSide brushes do assit the round robots with corners, so if you get a round one it\'s not that your corners will be entirely unswept. I have a dog who leaves cookie crumbs all around the house. I find a very tiny amount of either dog hair or cookie crumbs in the corners, but it does get most of what\'s in the corners. The D shape is only really advantageous in corners, nowhere else.\n\nNow here\'s the deal, if you\'re willing to spend a grand, then I strongly suggest you buy the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra as opposed to the S9 from Roomba. Don\'t even give Rooma a second thought if you\'re gonna spend that much.\n\nNot only will the S7 vacuum your floors, it\'ll also mop them, clean the mop, refill the water tank on robot so it\'s ready to go all week, drys the mop head if you buy the drying attachment (worth every penny), where as the Roomba will only vacuum. Roomba has a mopping robot too, but I still recommend against it. It does great in all reviews, but it doesn\'t clean the mop and that is why the roborock wins every time. These things were made to remove you as much as possible from floor care, and only the roborock gets close to that. There are other offerings who have the mop cleaning feature, like one from Deebot called the Omni? It does well, but people seem to like their roborock\'s better because of the features it has. There are a few other brands launching this feature as well that just now got announced, but we have to wait a while.\n\nThe other vacuum you named on this list is something I\'m not familiar with. Watch some YouTube reviews, preferably several and see what you think.\n\nI\'d say it\'s a safe bet tho. And if you only want it to vacuum and not mop, then like I said before, my shark is very likely comparable to the Neato as far as performance. I\'m sure you\'ll be happy with it.\n\nSo, if you just want it to vacuum, the Neato will do you fine, as will a Shark, or even a highly discounted Rooma or Roborock ($500 or less). Paying more than that is just paying an unnecessary expense when cheaper options perform similar if not the same on hardwood floors.\n\nIf you want it to mop and take you out of the picture as much as possible, then look no further than Roborock.\n\nI\'d suggest going to their websites, they\'ll give you a good breakdown on the differences between models.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7Zduy_GdD4w Roborock review \nhttps://youtu.be/3YYr-q5rNLM Roomba review\n\nOn YouTube, type the name of the robot and then vacuum wars. He does good work and may have a review of the ones you\'re looking at. I\'ve provided you two links above to reviews on his channel.\n\nExample: ""Neato (insert model) vacuum wars""\n\nHope this helps, lemme know if I can clarify anything for you', ""No problem! 😁\n\nYeah it's a bit cost prohibitive and that's why I didn't go with all S7's because it's approaching 5 grand just to put one on every floor of my house with added drying modules for each. \n\nRight now I can pick one up for $1300 new here, and a little lower if I wanna risk a shady purchase with potentially no warranty. \n\n1500 is a bit excessive I'm not gonna lie, and if you're really only wanting vacuuming then with the S7 Ultra or S9+ you'd be bringing a tank to a knife fight. \nBUT.... You'd be in a tank, so lol\n\nUnfortunate he didn't have a review for your Neato. The reality is that there really are a lot of RV's on the market and idk if it's simply a factor of cost, or what, that determines which vacuums he tests and which he doesn't. I'm sure there's someone with a video review of the D10 tho.\n\nAn alternative to your Neato that I can maybe recommend to you is perhaps something from Shark? I was afraid making my first purchase from them because I've seen people just losing their shit in the comments here about their experience with theirs 😆. \n\nI've had mine 3 weeks now, which granted isn't a lot of time, but I love it man. From what I can gather, the people saying stay away from shark seem to be restricted to just their older models which use VSLAM instead of Lidar. The people I've interacted with on here that have the same models as I do seem to love theirs as well and are having no issues whatsoever.\n\nTwo models:\n\nShark RV2502AE 60 day bin\nShark UR2500SR 30 day bin\n\nYou can find these all over, but Amazon appears to have the best deals on them. Go to Amazon, refine the search department for renewed, then just type model number in and see if they have any in stock. I got my renewed UR2500 for $250 from Amazon then added a 3 year warranty at checkout for like $30. Look around tho, there may be another online retailer in your region with a better price. \n\nDirect from shark is gonna be in the 400-600 range depending on the time of year. Amazon you can find them new anywhere from $350-$450. If you're interested and want to make sure you're getting the right thing, just message me here or privately and I'll help you out.\n\nIf the vacuum continues on over the next few months to a year without issue, then this damn thing has been worth every penny. Not to mention that eBay is littered with shark parts to rebuild your unit when it falls out of warranty. \n\n:)""]"

"['So far, I am very happy with the two Roborock S7 Max V Ultras I bought.  I got them on sale for Black Friday and I have only used them for 2 months. My impression is they are a notch above my older Roombas in terms of quality and performance.\n\nI like the build quality, software, and mapping.  I love the auto docking and auto clean and empty feature, and that they find their way back to my fairly hidden dock location under my cabinets (where I removed the toe kick and installed power just for them).\n\nI don\'t like that they still get stuck on the low ledges of my floor to ceiling windows, and the 1/2 inch metal bars at the bottom of my coffee tables, where they hump them like a dog.  They otherwise have excellent object avoidance, but sometimes get confused by wires and shoe laces.

Also, if you use it on a second floor, it does not have the ability to automatically return to base to clean its mop.  So my recommendation is one robot per floor.\n\nOverall, I give them 4 out of 5 stars, and feel like I made a good purchase for my needs.\n\nDefinitely avoid the Roomba Bravajet, as it just smears the dirt on your floor around, and is barely useful.

Might take you a day or two, but if you see nothing, then you\'re golden bro.\n\n• If it\'s user error, then the 1st place you\'re gonna wanna check is whether the mop is attached properly. It just squirts water onto the backside of the pad and the water then wicks it\'s way through the pad, dampening it. Nowhere should you see water puddles left behind -- the only thing you should see are the residual streaks (which quickly dry and vanish) that you see left behind just as if you were using any other mop.\n\nIF you do see a small amount of water on the floor, dry it up, allow the vac to finish it\'s job (dry up any other spots if any), open the app and lower the water dispersal rate, repeat test and see if that resolves the issue.\n\nAfter that you\'re probably looking at hardware, which means you\'re gonna have to return it or get sent some new replacement stuff.\n\nBeyond that tho, unless a floorcare specialist/installer that you trust tells you in no uncertain terms ""This will ruin your floors"", you\'re good to go. \n\nBut since I imagine that your shiny new floors have been sealed, then this vac is no different than using the mop that\'s likely recommended in your floor\'s care instructions, and your floor guy is gonna have to explain to you how this robot mop is somehow extraordinarily different than using a standard mop (it\'s not).\n\nNote: If your care instructions say that your floors should be mopped no more than x times per week, month, then your robo mop should not exceed that number.\n\nAlso, you can set it up to only mop when you\'re home if that makes you comfortable, and I\'d bet there\'s an easy way to be notified on your phone, or smart home devices, that will annouce when the robot has finished mopping so that you can at least have a little more peace of mind while you\'re running it through the paces and can easily go check when it\'s done.\n\nOne last thing -- you got brand new floors man and idk if you have pets, but whatever you end up with just make sure that it has a camera on it. iRobot has some kind of warranty that if it runs over dog shit in your house within the first year, they\'ll replace the unit for you. Roborock and iRobot (possibly other brands) are the main ones as far as AI vision goes -- and they\'re the best performing when it comes to avoiding things like that. It\'s not 100% yet, but you\'re far better off with a camera onboard then not. I can already see the look on your face walking in the door and discovering that your spendy new robot has just spent the last two hours successfully spreading it to every room in your house lol.\n\nIf you have multiple floors I recommend one for each level. Some users have reported slight but annoying issues when ferrying it from floor to floor, aka the robot might do some stupid stuff it otherwise wouldn\'t. You\'re buying these things to save you time and labor -- babysitting one as you move it through multiple floors is not ideal.\n\nMy house has 4 levels and I\'ll be damned if I\'m gonna ferry that thing from floor to floor.']"

A lot of people complain about it on r/roomba, but some people get along with it just fine. \n\nI would go for the j8+ like OP was originally keen on. The j7 came out in 2021, and I believe the j8 (which is just a Costco variant) came out in 2022. \n\nIt’s more than enough in terms of pickup on carpet, but has a much better navigation system and has obstacle avoidance and keep-out zones. \n\nInitially you may need to run it a few times to get the hair out of your carpets, but as you regularly run it it’ll look after the hair well-enough itself on a normal schedule. \n\nJust a suggestion. :)\n\nAlso, I’d like to add – whichever model you choose, definitely get the + version.

I haven't had the problems others have mentioned.  You definitely want a self empty bin.

Bagless will save you a lot of money.\n\nI'm assuming the rooms you want to vacuum are close together.    The room naming function works but is difficult to use if you're only using a phone or pad.  The map is pretty small and can't be expanded.  Using a stylus helps.  If the area to be cleaned is adjacent then a couple magnetic strips should work just fine.""]"

"['I tried both the  J7+ combo and roborock s7 maxv ultra.

Also much better for pet hair. \n\nYou’ll find this a lot with iRobot – they have a lot of patented tech, such as the bin full sensor, and the mop-lifting robot arm, that their competitors can’t use. \n\nAlso disagree with obstacle avoidance – iRobot put a lot of work into training its AI model, so much so that they guarantee that if the j7+ runs through pet poop they’ll replace it on the spot. \n\nBattery life on robot vacuums generally isn’t really a big deal, if they have recharge and resume. \n\nThe Roborock has better mopping, as it uses a oscillating system rather than a pressure-based system – but to be honest, mopping on robot vacuums is kind of a disappointment. In my opinion you’re best off buying a separate mopping robot, unless your house is mostly carpeted and you only have a few hard floors. \n\nThe Roborock app does have more features and the robot has a more efficient navigation system. It’s a bit “smarter” of a robot that the Roomba. But I don’t think it’s fair to say that Roborock is a clear winner in everything.', 'Yeah, Roomba users (aside from the Roomba s9) have reported that with pet hair – because it pulls it out of the carpet with the rollers but doesn’t it simply have the raw suction power to pick up lots of it at once, particularly on its first run. \n\nAs you run it regularly, it keeps it under control and at a manageable level on each run. \n\nThe Roomba s9 is the one with lots of suction power and is incredible in terms of raw performance, but the tech on it is old-hat now, sadly, as it was released in 2019.

I was watching it work and it is leaps and bounds over the ones I am used to. I have the Coredy R750 and the Roomba i3 evo 3150.\nThe coredy is nice for the price. It has a dust bin that it comes with that collects dust and I can swap it out for a water tank with a little mop thing that it drags along while dripping a little water (i put cleaning solution in it too) It seems to bump into things way less than the Roomba does. The thing about the coredy is the mop just drags a dirty cloth across the floor after a while. I can clean it, but I\'m bending down and cleaning it multiple times in the clean cycle or risking it just not doing an awesome job. The roomba has the self empty bin. I love that about it. I haven\'t had to empty that yet. I usually run both at the same time and block odd areas. They both have battles and will crash into each others\' bases making them have trouble finding home. I\'ve set roomba not to go near cordey\'s home and got magnetic straps i am gonna use so cord3y doesn\'t go near roomba\'s base. Roomba has more map features than cordey. But they both seem dumb. They clean the house, sure but there\'s no rhyme or reason to their movements. They move so haphazardly that it\'s just luck that they get the dirt. \n\nI haven\'t used my Narwal Freo at that big house yet. I\'ve only used it at my mom\'s place. Things I noticed the second I used it. The mapping feature is so fast. It goes into a room and scans it. It\'s not making the map by going around the entire outline of the room. It moves on a pattern. I know where it\'s going next. It shows live where it is on the map and knows where the base is. I can pick it up and put it down somewhere else and it knows where it is on the map. I can make my own names for rooms. I can set no go zones. I have carpets and I can actually let it go on them as it raises the mop. It actually mops the floor. I don\'t need to use cordey\'s mop feature anymore. \n\nI was watching it go near my brother\'s room door and prayed it wouldn\'t bang into his door while he slept. It did bang into a stool leg. It avoided hitting his door. It seems like it has a lift feature for getting over bumps. I watched it back up, lift itself up then rev forward to make it into the bathroom that had a lip. I can\'t wait to see how quiet or loud it is over my vents on the floor. Cordey is quiet over them, but roomba is loud AF. Brushes just spinning over the grates like a bad band came into town to play. One good thing about the Lidar is it should be too tall to go under and get stuck under my coffee tables. A minus is if I have bedspreads that hang low. It won\'t go unless I don\'t have them hanging. \n\nAnother bad about narwal is as it cost so much, I may be better off just getting the expensive solution rather than risking damage by trying to put my own solution in it. \n\nIf they sell a base for it that allows it to auto empty the dust bin,, I\'ll buy it and whatever attachments 8t needs. \n\nI saw that the Asian market had an auto fill auto empty tube mechanism... but they don\'t sell it in the US because setup was...too difficult for the US market. Gosh darn ""Stupid American"" stereotype making them not sell us stuff, haha...unless it was tested in America and users said it was too hard. I\'ve set up a bidet before so that was gonna be a piece of cake. Ah well. I don\'t mind emptying the water and refilling the clean one.', ""I'm not at my house with all the wood floors and carpet and everything i want to test it on, so I haven't used it much yet. In Mid February, I'll actually be heading to my house and bringing it with me there to test it. I didn't wanna test it where I'm staying because the guy I'm renting a room from has a dog, and I don't want to risk getting all the dog hair allergies in my house. I'm traveling for work, so I'm a lot of hours from home. My mom's apartment has a bunch of stuff in boxes ready for the move, so that's a bad place to test it except the kitchen, which is tile, not wood. I'll get a good test of it, just not yet, so I'm not the best to say how it is yet, but the app is awesome. I do wish I could get the camera thing the L10s said it had and the self emptying bin, but I've heard about issues down the line and the water thing getting clogged, I was just too scared to take the risk with the Dreame."", 'I\'ve been in my house for a week now. I still haven\'t worked out how often to run it since my nephews visit and are super messy. \nI had them going 5 times a day, (After meals and twice overnight) then lowered it to 4 times (after meals and overnight) now they are after breakfast 9:30am, after bedtime 10pm and overnight 4am for the other 2 so they\'re not running much while everyone is awake and the narwal goes 4am 10am 4pm 10pm. I just can\'t do all the food on the floor after they eat. It\'s still too often, and I may change the other 2 to once daily. The only reason I let them run is so I can empty the bins a little less. The carpet is always giving them a lot of dirt. The only one I don\'t have to empty is the roomba, but that one loves to get stuck. No lidar, older model etc. \nThe Narwal is my quietest vacuum yet. I love how it makes my floors shine. The cleaning solution and the oscillating mop pads are awesome. It has been pretty good at avoiding obstacles. It only got stuck twice so far under a bed... the bed had some double sided tape that I never ended up using to keep the mattress in place. That tape started to fall down and was on the ground part way and when the vacuum rolled over it, it got actually caught up in it and couldn\'t get out. \nAnother time it told me it was stuck and I checked the app. It said the brush rollers were tangled. My mom was doing laundry and it grabbed an underwear and told me it was tangled.  I told it to come back to the home base and saw it had a pair of undies.  Took that off before it went home and sent it on its way. I\'m glad I\'m able to override the""stuck"" nature and send it home. So far, it hasn\'t died on me yet. It charges while it cleans the mop and whenever I check the battery life, it\'s at least half. If I forget to leave my bedroom door open, it just skips it. I can tell it to do a specific room or avoid rooms or parts of rooms. For now, it avoids the laundry room and the room with the kids\' toys. I don\'t wanna risk it with their small toys. It has sucked up a battery before. I found it in the dust bin. \nIt is my smartest one yet though. It doesn\'t crash into things and doesn\'t get stuck under the coffee tables or the legs of the egg swing chair by deciding to shove itself under there so far it can\'t go back... looking at you coredy...it doesn\'t randomly get ""stuck"" on nothing at all where I have to go searching for it and making it make noise...looking at you roomba...I can see where it is in real time and know where it\'s vacuuming. When it got stuck, I looked at the map and knew where it was. And I\'m able to recall it to the base station, make it clean the mops or continue vacuuming if it says it had an error. I empty the dirty water bucket and fill the clean water after every 2 sessions since my house is big. My floors look great. I\'m way less worried about the nephews constantly dropping food. While I do wish it auto emptied, I\'m also glad it works as it does. I\'m thinking of moving one of the vacuums to the carpet area upstairs since narwal does such a good job... but I kinda want an auto empty one up there since it\'s carpet... but I don\'t wanna get rid of my auto empty one downstairs since I have a carpet down here too. (Roomba)\nThe Narwal cleans in a pattern that 100% makes sense. No random cleaning. I can tell it what order to clean each room and if it can\'t get to one room, it just moves on to the next one. I\'m happy with my purchase and I only have to change the water and empty the dust bin. I do have to take it from charging to empty the dust bin as it\'s covered, or pause the job as it\'ll pause and tell me to check the dust bin if I open and remove it. I love how narwal works. If only it could empty the dust bin, it\'d be perfect. I haven\'t messed with the cleaning solution as I was intending. Maybe once the one runs out and I buy replacements, I\'ll dilute it... but I\'m not sure I want to risk putting something else in there that doesn\'t belong. \nMy main concern with the Dreame L10s was I\'m worried about the water bin getting clogged as it has been known to do so. So far no issues with my narwal water. \nIt wasn\'t made in the US. Some grammar is a little odd, but not bad.', ""I've decided to lower my frequency to twice daily overnight. 10pm and 4am. I moved one of my vacuums down into the basement and just use the Narwal and the coredy (vacuum only) on my main floor. I empty the dust bins like every 2 days for both of them. I only use both of them because if I forget to empty the bin, I'll have double time before both fill up... I have like 1200 square feet and it takes 2h 15-2h 20 minutes to do the whole thing. I have to change the water in the morning... or whenever just before the 10pm mopping since most of my main floor is wood aside from the rug in the living room, and I let it wash the mops every 108 square feet. It has a method to the madness and I know where it's going and when as it does the same path every time it cleans. I've been startled by it before sneaking up on me when I've had my headphones on and been playing games. It is my quietest vacuum. It can be heard when not wearing headphones for sure, but it's not going to wake me up while I'm sleeping. I do like having it do 2 runs overnight only because my nephews eat in the middle of the night and I find the 10pm clean to be a bit early if they're gonna eat overnight and make messes, but I don't want the house to be dirty for so long. There's maybe 1 place where it gets stuck and I have no idea why. And it also gets stuck in curtains. Curtains that are on the floor are a no-go with lidar. It just won't go by them...and if it does, it may not want to get back out. Also, it doesn't always avoid cables. As it's 10pm or 4am, the lights are usually off. IDK if it needs light to see the cables or not...but yeah, it has gotten caught in them. It is really good about avoiding obstacles though for the most part...except skinny chair legs. It'll ram into those sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the mopping, I haven't had to mop since I have been using it. I walk barefoot and after using it, it passes my inspection. It does the carpets too. I don't have small children over super often, so I don't have all the cereal and big food particles on the floor, but I'll have a random small food item they miss. It picks it all up. I feel less stressed as I'm not cleaning up after them so much...if only it did counters, haha. With all the washing and cleaning and mopping etc, the mopping pads did start to fall apart. Mind you, I was doing 4x a day at first. I honestly think I can get away with once a day...but kids make messes so often that even after it cleans, someone is gonna make a mess again and if I don't want critters, I want it cleaned up quickly. Better it than me though, right? Haha. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally went from dumb robot vacuum to smart lidar, so this is a huge step up. The mapping is so fast, the cleaning is great. The spinning brushes man, it's a godsend! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cleaning solution was like half way done...so I decided to add water with a syringe and a blunt needle... then added a bit of murphy's wood cleaner (10mL) and filled the rest with water... So far, so good. YMMV, but $47+ for a cleaning solution...It has only been a few days, but as I only added a little, I'm hoping for no clogs. The consistency is most likely the same. No suds so far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really happy with it. Though I should say, there's a robot coming out that does it all and may be more reliable.  It's called the Roborock Q Revo. \n\nNGL, it's looking like the vacuum to get!""]"

"['Roborock all the way. It’s miles ahead of iRobot with advanced tech like LiDAR mapping, ultrasonic mopping, collision avoidance, stronger suction, and at the high end mop washing with the ultra dock. \n\nIf you’re able to spend $1400 on the s7 max v ultra, it will change your life. It’s honestly one of the best investments I’ve made because it cleans incredibly well, and is very hands off besides filling up the clean water tank and tossing the dirty water. \n\nI got it on black Friday for 1100 something…they usually have good deals around the holidays too…so you will def get significantly more bang for your buck than the iRobot s9 that costs a relatively close $900.', 'What are your needs? What type of flooring do you have? How much hardwood vs carpet.\n\nRoborocks are very good, but nothing cleans as well as a Roomba for carpets. The S9 is the most powerful Roomba and cleans very well. Most of the problems it has had have been worked out with all the software updates now. That said, their newest is the j7+ and it offers some of the best obstacle avoidance, and is the only one with any sort of guarantee to avoid pet waste. Roombas are almost always cheaper than Roborocks too, especially as most of them are still on sale. The j7+ can be found for around $600. If you\'re a Costco member you get extra replacement parts and a bigger battery, it\'s named the j8+, but it\'s the same price as the 7. Above all, Roombas are generally the most durable robots too, with nearly all major parts being available for purchase if needed, they still support their first robots too as they are still working! Irobots are also the only ones with real dirt sensors, to focus cleaning on extra dirty areas. They also are the only ones that reliably empty themselves as needed via sensors, vs just guessing and continuing. \n\nRoborock are very good too, especially if you have more hard floors and don\'t need to worry about pet waste. They easily have one of the best apps available , and software overall, along with navigation. Not to mention the S7MaxV ultra is more hands off in terms of floor cleaning, as it can vacuum and mop, and clean itself. It\'s worth noting however, while they are built well, and have shown to be pretty durable, if you have any problems, Roborock has a bad rap for customer help. Some people who buy their extended warranty don\'t even get help. I can\'t speak personally of that, but I\'ve heard it more than you would expect unfortunately.\n\nThese are the two main robots that have been dominating the market. Ecovacs are a ""hit or miss"" kind of robot,  generally their hardware is built well but their software is always lacking and they always have some sort of problem, or quirk. Other brands are where you start technically going from high end to mid, to lower end. Dreame, Eufy, Roidmi, etc. They are all generally good too, totally depends on your model and price. Again, given that the main manufacturers like Roomba and roborock are on sale right now, I\'d stick with them unless of course you find an even better deal otherwise.', ""I'd like to piggyback on this thread as I've been reading since Black Friday. I really want to try out the Roborocks S7 series too, but I heard the support is basically non-existent. Looking at that, I'm afraid to put 1000+ investment into something that might be a warranty nightmare a few months later.\n\nGiven I know Costco sells the S9 online, and they basically take it back if it's broken no questions... I am fear deciding at this point.\n\nAnyone know if Roborocks customer service has gotten better?"", ""Sorry lol, sometimes I start typing and get carried away!\n\nAlso, I understand! It sounds like a Roborock would be a great fit for you! Roombas have gotten better, especially with the j7, but given you don't have a ton of carpets, and you have the tricky area of tile, I think the Roborock would be better overall, as they have good suction for crevices and such, so that should help. Their navigation is nicer and more accurate, along with more features, like being able to clean a single room or area multiple times as needed, and more of course. \n\nAs far as the S7MaxV vs the S7ProUltra goes, I believe the only difference is the object recognition. The S7MAXV Ultra has an AI with an extra camera and sensors on the front to recognize and automatically avoid objects that may cause problems, like socks or cables. The S7ProUltra is the same machine, but without the object avoidance AI.\n\nIf you're not worried about the robot getting stuck on cables or shoes and stuff, then I would definitely save the extra money and just get the pro. Likewise, if you don't need mopping, then both should be available with the regular self emptying bin, without the mop part, if you wanted as well."", ""The max V ultra is the only one with the empty/wash/fill charging dock. I just got one and it is amazing. It empties the dustbin into the dock, washes the mopping pads and refills the mopping on its own. This is important if you have a larger home, as it will return to dock as needed during the cycle and then continue cleaning. I have roughly 2000 sqft downstairs of all hardwood, tile, and laminate, and it usually washes the mop about 3 times and empties the dustbin a couple times as well\nI generally don't ask it to clean the office or master bed/bath because of obstacles, so in reality it's self cleaning fairly often."", ""My j7+ is definitely a good vacuum and doesn't get stuck or lost (often) but it does still tend to miss areas and rooms. Because it's a camera only navigation system it needs ambient light to know where it is. If you don't have every room well lit it has a harder time figuring out where it is. Its definitely still a very capable robot though. They're also very easily repairable and easy to find parts for. \n\nThe reason why roombas are better at cleaning carpet is because Roomba has a patent Monopoly on the dual brush roller design.\n\nThe RoboRock Max V is also not without its issues. I have heard the washing system for the mop can be finicky and the lifting system only lifts the mop 5mm.  Another common complaint is that the max fee goes through mops pretty quickly but my Narwal T10 with a very different self washing mop system also goes through mops really fast. \n\n If you're looking for something with obstacle avoidance, self washing mop, lidar, it's still a great choice.""]"
"[""First, figure out your current non working robot. Definitely let them know you received it not working, they will probably ask you to send it back and refund you. They might even just tell you to keep it and refund you anyway. Either way, you bought something that's not working, and should be compensated, especially as it should be within the 30 day return window at the least.\n\nSecond, I personally agree with the person below, Ecovacs can be very hit and miss, and for how expensive they generally are, they should be better. Given how many are available for purchases used says a lot too. I also agree with staying away from some of the smaller known brands, unless you can score a really good deal to make it worth it. Some might be good, some might be bad, just be cautious. \n\nThird, I don't know what is and isn't available for you, but if it's available, a good machine I would look into is the base model Irobot I3+. They might be on sale for the holidays and are definitely worth the extra money. They clean well and last longer than most robots. Another would be a roborock or Dreame. Personally I have two iLife machines, they are not self emptying but are cheap and work well, the company was also helpful when I needed them.\n\nHonestly some more information would help too. Like how much space do you need to clean? Overall budget, what's the max? What type of floors? Pets? Features you need, want, or don't care about?\n\n Most robots have decent filtration now thankfully, but not all are equally as good. Some self emptying stations are the same way, some may use generic bags, vs some using HEPA. Some may use a bag and an extra filter. If you have allergies it would be better to get one with the better bags or filters. If you have a lower budget or less space I wouldn't worry too much about self emptying as that feature generally adds a lot to the price, but care more about the filtration of the machine. Robots tend to pack the dust in their bins well enough it doesn't fly around too much, but again, some or better than others.""]"

"['I wonder if the performance of the S7 and my S4 Max is significantly different; one of things I noticed when comparing a few of the robot vacuums is that the S4 max had a very ""direct"" airflow path; the air flows in through the brush roller, up and back into the bin, the filter is on the back of the bin and the air flows straight out the back of the bot.\n\nWith the Shark AI Ultra, the airflow seemed a lot more convoluted, flowing through the brush roller, up and back into the bin, then has to turn over that sort of baffle assembly, throw the filter at the top of the housing, then out the front of the bin, then another turn to go out the side of the unit.\n\nI can see that this is a result of the design for the self empty out the rear of the vacuum.\n\nI really like the idea of these self emptying vacuums, but maybe there\'s a performance penalty being paid for needing to pack that extra hardware into the bot.']"

They asked us to send the robot back (not the whole unit), and gave us a shipping label. In less than a week it came back, in the same box, and still didn't work. They said they would send a new robot. Repeated the return process. Received a new robot that wouldn't pair to the base unit because the serial numbers didn't match. They had us try something in the app but it still didn't work. So, they had us return the entire thing this time and sent a new one. This one had a problem sucking up the dirty water and flooded the area. So, again they had us return the entire unit and sent us a new one. This time it used too much water when mopping leaving a wet mess everywhere, and running out of water long before completing the task. Finally they admitted defeat and had us return it for a refund.  This all took place over a period of more than 2 months. \n\nSo, when it worked it was amazing. Once it developed a problem, customer service was slow to respond initially but became more responsive as time went on.

The map was beeing updated in grey.\nWhen i cleared the whole house this way, i clicked again clean whole house but i made two virtual walls so it does not go around the whole house since i have a big house, and the map was updated, meaning the grey areas have now changed colour to match the rooms they form part of.\n\nYou might also encounter a problem where the robot might move the charging area on the map. If this happens, remove robot from charging, place it in front of charger hit return to charging dock from app and stay in front of robot when it is going the wrong way. This may take up to 5 minutes. Then the robot will see / sense that the charger is in that area and it will give up going to the previous wrong location and proceed to the charging dock.\n\nHope this helps.']"

The price is negligible.  I really hope the device holds up, there are reviews (as usual) both positive and negative about reliability.']"
['Sounds like the s7 might be the right choice then? The only feature I don’t like is the fact that you need to pay extra for the mop drying feature on the s7. I guess it’s not a huge deal when you get better performance out of the vacuum']
"['I bought the Airrobo P20 last week, Walmart early Black Friday had it at $99.99 and still does. It\'s a budget model so there are no mopping or self-emptying features but I\'m impressed so far. It uses gyroscope navigation so it\'s not randomly bouncing off of everything, it goes back and forth. That\'s the reason I chose this over the Eufy budget models.\n\nMy main vacuum is a Miele classic c-1 canister with a turbo brush (it rotates via suction). My husband is in a power chair and has a service dog. I installed 24"" industrial carpet tiles in the living room which is much smoother for him than padded carpet. The Miele leaves a surprising amount of dog hair behind on it. The Airrobo is picking up a lot of that now, so it\'s doing what I wanted. It has a rubber scraper type blade behind the brush that\'s probably helping. I\'m a little surprised (and a wee bit disgusted, LOL) by what I\'ve found in the dustbin so far.\n\nThe Miele is bagged; it has powerful suction and it does get fine dust better, which is why I bought it because my husband also has COPD from Agent Orange. Dog hair can make vacuums stink so I use a cut-to-fit charcoal filter along with the regular filter in it. I figured a robot vac would be good enough for everyday vacuuming between deeper cleanings with the Miele. So for my situation this little robot is a good combo.\n\nWe live in a double-wide so space is tight. The Airrobo seems to navigate our home quite well -- so far it\'s only gotten stuck under the edge of a rocker recliner. The app is nice. I was initially going to just use the remote control but decided I\'d try the app. I\'m glad I did because that enables the machine to downloaded a software update and there are more options.\n\nIt\'s the same price on the airrobo site today, as well as on Amazon. For a hundred bucks I\'m very happy with it.', 'Mopping on robot vacuum cleaners is pretty lame, even on high-end models. \n\nI would suggest focusing on getting a good robot vacuum cleaner. The Roomba j7+ is pretty good. \n\nIn terms of mopping – if you really care about mopping, you’re best off getting a dedicated mopping robot. \n\nDon’t bother with the iRobot Braava mop lineup; the overall cleaning performance is pretty good if you check out vacuum wars videos. But they use a very bad 2019 VSLAM system from the Roomba S9 and it struggles with floor transitions. \n\nIf they released one with the navigation system from the j7+ then it’d be an instant buy. But sadly not. \n\nBottom line: buy a good robot vacuum like a Roomba j7+ and a dedicated mopping robot if you really want mopping. :)']"
"[""Go tonthe YouTube channel Vacuum Wars and watch some of their vids.  Thats a quick place to pick up decent basic info and see reviews of bots from major producers.   I wish they had more reviews of more of the smaller brands.  You only will need to watch a 3-5 of them. One should be the best of 2022.  \n\nDecide on the features you want and then narrow down your choices based upon reviews.  I'd recommend passing on the top end models for your first bot. Its like buying a top of the line computer for bragging rights only to have it become a run of the mill entry inn6 months to a year.  The rate of change has been pretty high.  Second after you've owned one for a while you'll find things you love, hate and could be improved which will help you pick out your next one.  \n\nAuto empty is a must.  I'd recommend based on my experience that AI obsticle avoidance is something to be strongly considered.  Id skip mopping.  I dont think they are ready yet Fourth pay attention to what the reviews say about the app. Fifth if you have furniture you want to get under pay attention to the total height of the bot."", ""So because you have mostly carpet, that automatically gets an Irobot Roomba recommendation. Nothing cleans carpets better than a Roomba. They are also built to last and have most major parts available if needed. Irobot still supports their old robots too, unlike most of the competition. \n\nThat in mind, and because as of today they are all still on sale, if you don't need any crazy fancy options, your best bet would be the Roomba i3+ Evo. Great cleaning at a good price. It also has the ability to select what room you want cleaner, and has a self emptying bin.\n\nIf you want more features, and the current flagship robot from Irobot, the Roomba j7+ is also your best bet. You get all the features and options, and it's on sale today too, with Amazon specifically giving a little extra discount. The biggest difference with the j7 is the object avoidence system, helping to keep the robot out of harms way. It also allows for better mapping too, meaning not only can you specify the room, but the exact area or spot too, even just asking Roomba to clean in front of the kitchen counter via Alexa or Google. Roombas are also the only machines to have dual rollers for cleaning, and can actually determine what areas are dirtier than others, and focus cleaning there. \n\nOf course any Roborock is also a good choice. If you want the highest end, the S7 MaxV is their current flagship. You can buy the robot by itself without any docking station now, and add one down the road if you wanted. The Q5+ and Q7+ are also great, and are considered there lower to mid-range robots at better prices.\n\n The biggest problem with Roborock is their price, they are expensive. But they are also very good. They clean very well, are built well, have arguably the best app and software, and better flexibility. They however don't clean carpets as well as Roomba."", 'You are the best; thank you for responding and helping me!', 'No problem! Happy to help!', 'This was great advice.  I’ve owned the J7+ and just bought the Roborock S7 Max V.    I’ve also owned the Ecovacs T8 and Roomba i8.  The Roombas are great on carpet.  The Roborocks are good on carpet, but also mop,  super fast at mapping and navigation and reliable.\n\nThe i3+ would be great for a smaller apartment.  My one issue with Roombas is they bump into furniture a lot and sometimes loudly.  The J7+ with AI fixed this and is MUCH gentler and quicker.  It’s on sale for $599 right now.  It’s what I use for a carpeted upstairs.\n\nLast thing is where you buy.  If you have a Costco membership, I’d try to buy there over Amazon.  Costco took back a misbehaving T8 bot for me after 1.5 years, with no hassle.  Their bundles also added better battery life and a few extra filters and rollers.  They have the J7 and i8 Roombas on sale now.  Roborock Q7+ from Amazon would be another to look at for the price you mentioned.\n\nGood luck!']"
"[""1 is usually a problem with the soap.....Best to water it down with distilled water.\n\n2. All of them are overhyped in one way or another.\n\n3.

"[""To keep it simple, if you're following Amazon, the Irobot is $130 cheaper as of writing this, and seems exactly what you want, so I would say that.\n\nThe longer explanation: because you're not worried about app features, and are prioritizing longevity, I would still say the Roomba. Roombas are known for being durable, and easily repairable with many major parts available to swap out if you need to. Roombas are also the best at cleaning carpets, no robot has beat them yet, even with their lowest models like the i3. \n\nNow I'm not bashing the Roborock q5, as it's also a great vacuum. You will get way more features and options. No-go zones, virtual walls, carpet boost, suction settings, etc. They also clean very well on all flooring, however like I said, nothing out cleans a Roomba on carpet. If you have more hard flooring, and only some carpet then the Roborock would be better. They're pretty durable so far, but they don't have the reputation that Roomba has, especially on the customer service end. In fairness, nearly no company stacks up against Irobot, Roomba was, and is, the original, and they intend to keep it that way. The Q5 is a good machine for sure, however given the price difference, it could be a harder buy. Just be sure you don't want the extra features, sometimes they come in handy, but at the same time, it mind as well just clean the whole place anyways. \n\nIf you really don't care about the extra features, the Roomba is both cheaper, and will probably be easier to repair.\n\nTo note however, both utilize bags for their self emptying stations. If I'm not mistaken, the only robots that have bagless stations are Sharks. The exception here is Roborock, in that their station for the S7 does have the ability to be bagless, or bagged. However it's only for that model, and is an added expense."", 'This is super helpful, thanks so much.\n\nThe only other question I have is about handling hair and not getting tangled. Which do you think is better?', 'Both are probably fairly similar. They just go about it in different ways. \n\nRoborock tries to resist the tangle in the first place, but may not always work, so you get some that will wrap around the brush. The Roomba tries to resist it too, but if hair does wrap, it gets purposely pushed to the ends of the rollers, and can be removed in one easy to deal with clump.']"
"[""I believe they skipped Zero-M and went straight to Power Fins for most of their robots. That said, nearly every and all Shark Robots had some form of anti tangle system, mainly with a built in comb to help reduce build up, which is mainly how the zero m system works. \n\nAs far as Duo Clean goes, it's not really needed for robots. They're designed to be able to clean both large and small particles alike. They have a larger gap than a normal vacuum does for the floor head, meaning larger things can just get sucked up right away.\n\nThis actually follows their main vacuums now as well. Most, if not all, Zero-M machines have been updated to Power Fins. It's a very similar system, with the biggest difference being the fins are slightly longer, and the bristles are in long rows in-line with the fins, rather than separate. \n\nAbove all, I think you're also right, Irobot has dual roller patents for their Roombas, and they are not gonna let go any time soon, if they can help it. I'm sure there would be a way to change it enough to avoid problems, but I'm sure that's more costly, and nobody wants to temp them into getting in trouble.""]"
"[""Yeah, lidar is incredible It always knowing where it is in the room since it's constantly refreshing that info every rotation. The camera requires every room to be well lit while cleaning. Cameras are great for obstacle avoidance which I do love on my j7+. \n\nMy j7+ does clean well but like I said, it can sometimes miss rooms. Also, fuck Amazon for buying it. That's where the camera data is going now too. Don't forget that lol""]"
"[""If wires are a concern, then you need something extra smart, with some sort of AI object detection and avoidence built in. The Roomba J7+ is a great machine. As is the Roborock S7MaxV, and Ecovacs OmniX1. There is also the Dreame Z10 and Samsung Jetbot Ai+.\n\nIf you have carpet, nothing out cleans Roomba. However the best overall in the market is probably the Roborock S7MaxV. Honestly, I would highly recommend you look at Vacuum Wars in YouTube, he is also on Facebook and even Amazon. He tests a lot of robots, and may help you narrow down your decision. \n\nThat said, it would still be better if you could do some cable management, like using zip-ties or other wire management helpers. While the AI systems are very good, depending on the situation, it may still not see something or get caught and trapped somewhere.\n\nAs far as doors go, your best bet is to keep them open as much as possible, or get a door stopper. Most higher end robots won't bump and move things as much, so it shouldn't be a big concern, but again relying on robot alone may still lead it to get trapped at some point.""]"

Even the most expensive one. If you have shag carpets, probably the robot won’t clean it.\n\nWhile watching reviews on youtube, don’t be fooled secret sponsored videos. I saw a 20min video that all says shitty Viomi is better than Roborock S7.\n\nDon’t worry about Pa value too much. You will see Xiomi robot with 4000 pa and Roborock with 2500 pa. Xiomi is better? No. Pa is important but not alone. Robot also need power to function which indicated by W.\n\nI think it is more important to robot has good app than suction power, especially you are kinda obsessed person. You can go crazy about robot’s behaviour. I have deebot t9, it is pretty good but the app is horrible. On the other hand are other brands apps flawless? Ofc not. Like I said, every robot has a problem.\n\nIf your carpeted areas seperate the hardwood and you want robot to mop, roborock S7 or upper model are only choice because of mop lifting feature.\n\nThere are tons of things about vacuum robots as you notice. You need to do research deeply, good luck!', 'Ok yeah. You had said you didn’t care about mopping so I didn’t add.

"[""Overall, yes the S7 MaxV Ultra is currently the best robot as a whole. The closest thing that competes is the Deebot X1 Omni, however I believe there is now a Dreame robot similar too. They all have Ai, vacuuming, mopping, and will self empty and clean its mop.\n\n However I believe most will agree that Ecovac deebots have many.... Quirks. They generally are ok, but personally I would rather just get the roborock. Roborock pretty much has the best software and customizability, with irobot being second. Irobots software is interesting in that it can talk to the matching mop, and can even suggest areas of concern and focus cleaning as needed if that's if interest.\n\nThe best robot for vacuuming alone is probably the Roomba j7+, and its new brother the j7+mop. While they now have a mop option with the j7 as well, it does not self clean like the above. The Roomba j7 has better Ai than the roborock if you have pets, it has a pet owners official promise (poop), if it hits pet waste in the first year of owning it, they will replace it. You also have the option to subscribe/rent it, everything included, even insurance for a monthly fee. \n\nThere is also the Samsung jetbot Ai+. Again it is not perfect, and only has a vacuum option, but if you have 90%+ hard flooring, it may be a better option. All the robots here have great pickup and cleaning, however the Samsung has a large soft brush roll that works best specifically for hard floors. It also has a very good Ai system, and is the only robot other than Dyson and iLife to use Cyclones to help keep the filter clean, if more fine dust is a concern. \n\nKeep in mind however, this can all be subjective and can depend on the user and your situation.

"['I am unsure about the X8, however it seems to be a decent bot but I would recommend having a look at what Roborock has to offer just to be safe. If you don\'t care about mopping, have a look at their Q-series. Of course you can\'t go wrong with an S-series if you can find one In your budget. I would personally stay away from the S5, as that is an older model and does not have some of the new features. As for the Roomba, if you have a cluttered home, I\'m not sure if I could recommend a Roomba, due to their camera navigation not being as smart as Roborock\'s and maybe even the X8\'s. I own a Roomba i6 and it works for me. I use it in a small space. It does sometimes bounce back and forth on my chair leg and table leg, which I feel like is typical behavior for Roomba. But if you have a fairly ""simple"" home where you feel like a robot shouldn\'t have trouble navigating, I would recommend the Roomba i3. I think Roombas have trouble navigating in tight/awkward spaces. If you can, get a Roborock. If you can\'t, I think the Roomba i3 wouldn\'t be the end of the world.  \nPS: None of the models I\'ve mentioned actually have a remote. I think Roborock has the best app. I believe the only Roomba model that supports the remote that they still make is the 692/694, which wouldn\'t be worth upgrading to from the 11s.

There's videos on YouTube about mopping tests so you could also check those out. If you decide to get any of the Roborocks from the S7-series(which i would recommend if you want to make sure you get good mopping), they will automatically lift their mopping pad once they detect carpet. It doesn't raise that high though, so it really only for for low rugs. The S7-series also vibrates the mopping pad, which i'm not sure if they really clean better than the other Roborocks, but it's still there.

The suction power can also get adjusted to stronger, with one dog, level 1 for me is enough, but many dogs special case so would check if roborock would work better for you for a bit bigger price investment.\n\nWhat i read before is that roomba is very noisy, for me that already was a dealbreaker.']"
"['This is a great breakdown, thank you! And honestly for our first robot this sounds like the perfect start. I’m assuming I’m going to fall in love and upgrade a year or two from now.\n\nWe both work from home - could you explain the bump and run annoyance?', 'Sure - a mapping robot will vacuum in a fairly logical way, kind of like a human would. It enters a room and vacuums in long rows, starting, say, at the left edge near a wall and ending at the right edge near the wall. It will then travel to the next room - often not vacuuming over areas it knows it has already vacuumed - and repeats the process in the next room. \n\nA bump and run robot basically goes in a straight line until it bumps into something - a wall, a door, a chair leg - and then goes off in a straight line away from whatever it hit - at a maybe 45 degree angle to where it hit. Imagine a pool ball bouncing off the edges of a pool table. (It\'s not *quite* like that - it will kind of ""feel around"" when it hits an obstacle, so it will clean along the edge of a wall, and it will also feel its way around a chair leg to clean).\n\nSo it takes a little longer to clean (90 minutes vs. 60 minutes in my house), and it will carom all over the house, sometimes entering a room, hitting an obstacle, and leaving it to clean somewhere else.\n\nIt does clean about as well as mapping robots - the bump and run algorithm means that it will almost always cover all of the ˜1000 sq ft in 90 minutes. Imagine a pool ball from the earlier example being self powered and bouncing from edge to edge for 90 minutes - it\'s going to cover the entire surface. \n\nThe eufy is pretty good at detecting obstacles a couple of inches before it hits them and slowing down to just gently tap them; OG Roombas used to hit them pretty hard.']"
"[""I ended up installing an older version from APKPure, but then I had to spend another four hours trying to get the vacuum to connect to my wifi.\n\nI was just about to resign myself to the fact that it just wasn't going to work when I came across an off-hand comment somewhere else that said to make sure you have the GPS location turned on on your phone/tablet or it won't connect.  I have no idea why, but that was apparently the key I was missing--so if anyone else is having an issue getting it to connect to your wifi, make sure your location settings are turned on (this particular tablet doesn't have GPS, so it seems to be okay with the wifi scanning location settings). I don't know why it needs this, but at least it finally worked.""]"
"['I have the roomba j7+ now and had a shark IQ before this. You will need to check with the manufacturer of the unit you are looking at to see if it can do Room by room on a schedule so you can have it do specific rooms but not your bedroom at night. \n\nMy roomba has it built into the app so I can schedule specific rooms or groups of rooms.  The shark didn’t have it in the schedule feature on the app. It was the whole house or nothing on a schedule but I did figure out how to get the shark to do specific rooms on a schedule using Alexa. \n\nAnd like others said you’ll want a unit that has lidar.', 'I agree on paper yes LiDAR should be superior. I tried a non-LiDAR i8 (bigger battery version of i7 from Costco only) the ceiling camera VSLAM was horrid. The j7+ front camera VSLAM (w/ illumination) with actual AI object detection won me over (I did the iRobot Select since it includes warranty even accidental damage as long as you subscribe and all parts and disposable items included in the membership shipped for free). I have seen a lot of posts from every brand of robot dying out just past the 1year warranty. The Roomba\'s also won me over because they\'re usually shorter than LiDAR based bots and go under more of my furniture. I tried two LiDAR bots but returned them to Costco. I fully believe in LiDAR though, in execution it wasn\'t superior for me. I know Tesla\'s have some other sensors but they rely a lot on the camera and Elon calls LiDAR a ""crutch"", I have mixed feelings about that. But iRobot has apparently said they won\'t add the structured light sensor like on the S9 to future models as the j7 exceeded their expectations.\n\nI think iRobot could add and others (while adding an object detection camera) could switch to a flat style LiDAR on the body like the iPhone 13 and 14 Pro have next to the camera. I think iRobot could add it and the other could shorten the body of their bots with it to get rid of the hump.\n\nI know the Roomba may have less suction but I love the dual brushes for debris pickup. I still believe we\'re 1-2 models from perfection with any brand of Robot Vacuum. They\'ve come a long way, all brands of robot vacuums, and they are almost, and soon will be pretty much perfect.\n\nP.S. the LIDAR AI Shark was one I tried their current app & robot update about bricked it and the past 2-3 months on the Apple app store if you sort by recent there is not one review over 1 star. They claim they\'re working on it.']"
"[""You have to make sure that your router has the 2.4ghz frequency. Dual-Band or 5ghz won't really work as as most Dual-Band routers want to switch to the 5ghz band for devices within close range, i.e., inside your house. I had this same issue and when I found a cheap 2.4ghz router, I used that one to set it up and everything was fine after that. Hope this helps!""]"
['It’s marketing. My unit’s battery died but they replaced it. For the price I am still pleased. \n\nMy sister visited and literally said “your dogs don’t shed” because the bot kept the floor so clean. (I have Dalmatians- they shed a lot!)']
"['That’s surprising. I have a Z10 and the capacity is much lower but our mop is wet. We dampened the mop before we put it on and switch the water setting to high. It doesn’t add water to the mop but sprays water onto to floor in front of it.', ""I have the same issue and think of returning it. This is really annoying as it doesn't really mop that way.\n\nI don't understand why this happens. I thought that it might have an empty water tank. I told it to return to the station after the minimum m² I could set (which was 10 m²). This still didn't help and it still dry mops."", 'I created this account just to post an alternative solution. Short version: Lying on the floor to suck with a straw is ridiculous and also ineffective. I got a 5 ml dose syringe at the pharmacy (free of charge in Sweden), but you can get them online for like 1 $/€ including shipping. Took one half syringe of air and then during the 2nd try it started bubbling and eventually water streamed perfectly. Much better than a straw (which I also tried and didn’t work). I had the waste tank removed and also the “Multi-Surface Floor Cleaner” removed as well – and I did not activate self-repair or anything like that just did while the robot was out and nothing going on in the base station.\n\nLong version:\n\nI also had the issue with no water coming to the robot nor base station. Pressing “Plug-in Version Number” 5-10 times and selecting “Base Station Self-Repair” did help after awhile to fill the base station with water. However the robot didn’t fill up. The way you can tell if it does is to tell it to go mop somewhere where you can clearly see and then hit pause -> turn it upside down -> remove the mopping pad (velcro), but keep the plastic holder -> put it back on the floor and hit resume. Then follow it around with a mobile torch or a flash light and listen to the sounds (easier if you put it on mop only and no vacuuming).  It takes a while before it starts pumping out water, like a couple of minutes, then every 20-30 seconds it will try to refill the mopping pads with water and should leave wet stains on the floor when doing so, how often/much depends on which humidity it’s set on I guess. If it doesn’t, there is no water in the robot and you need to try the syringe trick. I pressed down on the rubber in the middle with the dose syringe to open it and just used the syringe like I would fill it with medicine. I hade one of those dose syringes with a bottle adapter so it fit really nicely. Perhaps they should complement the box with syringes lol. Seems to be rather bad testing done since they rolled it out with this issue. I had two Dreame L10s Ultras and the build quality seems robust at first glance, but the two I’ve had are vastly different when it comes to sounds. My 2nd one sound has a low frequency mechanical whine from the motor when the mop pads are twisting and has way worse Wi-Fi connection than the first one. Failed to setup Wi-Fi first try and doesn’t seem to update as often on the map about its whereabouts as my first one did. I exchanged my first cause the straw trick didn’t work for me, wish I had thought about the syringe the first time. So I really hope this will help someone, obviously shouldn’t need to go through the hassle for a robot vacuum with this price, but at the same time it’s only air in the tubes that need to be evacuated, nothing is wrong with the product except for the engineering… Guess it’s the cost of being an early adopter.', 'Need to follow this post. So helpful', 'I just submitted feedback through their app. It feels like the onboard water tank will be empty before the room is fully cleaned. \n\nAnd even though it is set to self clean every 10 m2 it really doesn’t help. And that’s the minimum.', '\nIn your case, do you see water in the base injector? and in the robot? You have to see drops,,,, a sign that the tank is full but well, if it does not guarantee and they will surely give you one that does not have that problem, luckily it works perfectly for me, and I can say that it does it very very well I hope future updates in the app it shows that it is very new but it is very fine I cannot compare it but,,, if I can say that it is going very well and very fine navigation, it is very tidy', 'Is there anything else you feel is bad on it? I was about to buy the RoboRock until I found out about the this one and it seems like it’s way better than RR, other than the mop issue. \n\nIt uses LiDAR, RGB camera, etc. everything is the same. People say the app is just as good, the performance is just as good or better. But it has a much nicer dock and a dryer for the mop pads! \n\nIf it is only the mopping issue, I think I can live with the workaround you mention. But if there are even more performance or app issues… no thanks!', ""I think you mean the S7 MaxV Ultra? The one with the huge station with water tank and cameras on the front of the bot?\nHow does the performance compare?\n\nI'm kinda torn between the base S7 and the L10s Pro (the one without the station).""]"

But all robovacs are kind of loud on hard surfaces. \n\nRoombas are generally better at pet hair because of the dual rollers. But with one dog and mostly hard surfaces, there will probably not be much of a difference if you run it every day. \n\nMapping won't make robovacs clean better, but it will make them more efficient, which helps with cleaning larger spaces (including that they can return to the base, recharge, and then continue cleaning), and with cleaning smaller spaces faster.\n\nBut the mapping is really nice to have if you are home when the robovac runs. Because it's always something of an annoyance, so it's nice that it finishes as fast as possible, and it's nice that you can tell it to not clean a particular room if you happen to be in it, and that you could further minimize distractions by having it clean only half of the house each day (although I wouldn't really do that with pets)."", ""Skip the roombas I've owned almost $8k worth over 10 years and not one was worth half of what I paid.

"['If you can still return it you should. I picked up a shark iq self empty and had it 2 weeks.
