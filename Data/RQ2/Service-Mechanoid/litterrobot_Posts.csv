"I just got my litter robot 4 and have reset it a few times for incorrect weight. My 18lb cat does not weigh 6lbs (trust me, there are days I wish he did!!). Is there anything I‚Äôm doing incorrectly (or not doing ) in the reset or tare the scale?"
"Acclimation training in progress!2 years ago, u/DefNotAShark posted a comprehensive account of what worked for him to acclimate his scared cat. I followed it closely, although my cat isn‚Äôt as affection motivated as his. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a look to any new user. Both he and I had immediate success by physically placing our cats into old school litter boxes years ago. Both of us did the same with LR (though, admittedly, I did so much less aggressively because my cat doesn‚Äôt love being held as much as his). I also used a mixture of Dr. Elsey‚Äôs cat attract litter with her usual (Fresh Step w/ Febreze).

My LR4 arrived on Sunday, and today on Friday (Day 5), I have documented success! This feels like a huge victory because my 5 year old girl is highly skittish and can be resistant to change. She‚Äôs actually been using it for about two days (maybe 3?) now. 

I was paranoid that she wasn‚Äôt using it because I‚Äôve caught myself being absentminded and distracted during the last week, and I somehow convinced myself that the waste in it could have just been the few clumps I added from her old litter box, even though those clumps were clearly not in the same position as I‚Äôd left them ü§£. To stake her out and be sure, I was able to repurpose an old smartphone into a fully functional pet cam. (Shout-out to Alfred Home Security app, which is an outstanding free app!)

Next phase will be letting her see it run a cycle. Gonna keep cycling it whenever she‚Äôs not around for at least the next week or two. Maybe more. Terrified she‚Äôs gonna lose trust in it once she sees it move. On several levels: can‚Äôt afford to lose that sweet sweet progress! 

Posting this was one part ‚Äúsuccess story in progress‚Äù, one part ‚Äútips for new users‚Äù, and one part self-serving ‚Äúkeeping my own morale up.‚Äù üòÇ"
Can LR4 with one cat be left unattended for a week?I currently use the PetSafe Scoopfree. The price of the replacement litter trays is making this no longer cost effective. I've been looking at the LR4 but I need something I can leave for a week at a time and trust to work without supervision. I see several reviews saying that the sensors get dusty and can cause frequent issues. Is this really as bad as it sounds? Is anyone able to let the LR4 run for a week without any attention? I just have one cat so I don't expect it to have to be emptied sooner than a week. Thanks!
Cleaning / Maintenance recommendationsI‚Äôve been enjoying my new LR3 C since 5/5/23. Am going away early June. Looking to ensure solid functioning and simply maintain appropriately. I searched on Reddit and found no posts. I trust your expertise! Any links or bullets much appreciated!! üíñüêà‚Äç‚¨õ
"How to get your litter robot set up for success.This is my third litter robot, brand new, model 3 without Wi-Fi. One is working just fine, and the other needs some parts.

To be honest, I've taken my robots for granted for a while now. With too many cats using one, it can get pretty messy. So here's my question: how can I set up a new litter robot for success? Specifically, is there a way to disable some of the sensors without losing any of the functionality?

As you may have guessed, it's that weird sensor that always seems to get covered in cat litter during the cleaning cycle. Any ideas or advice?""

Edit+  just a quick reminder to myself: don't go overboard with the cleaning liquids on the metal part of the litter robot. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!"""

"Is 24 hour sleep mode possible?My cats are still getting to know our LR -- three cats, we've had it two weeks, and today for the first time one of them used it. It's been off all that time, except when I did a manual cycle. No one seems terrified of it, which is great, because two of them are very skittish.

I'd like to be able to leave it on, so that I can tell if cats are checking it out even if they don't use it, and so I know sooner if they do use it (or at least may have used it), but I definitely don't want to accidentally spook any of them before they're all using it regularly. 

I see that in the app I can set Sleep Mode to run from 12am to 12am both weekdays and weekends, now, but has anyone actually ***done*** this? I'm worried it might end up reading that time as no time rather than 24 hours, or that it might run itself once at 12am every night with that setup. Usually, I'd just test something like that by doing it, but like I said... I'm pretty worried about spooking one or more of them out of trying and trusting it."
"I regret getting a litter robot.I've had a litter robot 3 for a month now, and I gotta say.. It sucks. The cats use it just fine, but it feels like the stupid thing gets stuck every other day, and half the time the cats' waste gets stuck on the inside of the wall and it touches their fur when they are trying to use it (and even the stuff that gets dropped in the bin still leaves smears of wet urine or cat shit on the inside walls).. I've tried several kinds of clumping clay cat litter, all with the same results. Frankly though, the fact the thing gets stuck and just sits there with flashing yellow lights is irritating as hell. Can't trust the damn thing. What happens if we leave on a trip or something? The litter box will just get stuck and the cats won't have a place to shit for a few days, right? I actually regret getting rid of my old regular litter boxes. Only consolation is that it was a gift, and I didn't pay for it."
"LR4: Massive waste of money and timeI‚Äôm fed up with this machine after 5 months. I spend far more time dealing with it than we ever did with a regular litter box. On top of that, because we are supposed to trust it to do its job and it doesn‚Äôt, the cat ends up peeing elsewhere in the house. The design was a neat idea and if this was a manual crank to dump the litter in the box for about 20% of the price, it would be great. We‚Äôve fully cleaned it several times, checked sensors, etc and it never works right. 

Constant faults, being stuck in the emptying position, bonnet comes loose and there‚Äôs a gap between it and the ring, misreads on how full the bin is even when fully empty, more faults or stopping for no reason‚Ä¶ every single damn day it‚Äôs something. 

This POS shouldn‚Äôt be in production."
I wouldn‚Äôt be rushing to update and calibrate LR4 - mine shows 40% full afterwards with bag emptySubject line says it all. The calibration was a waste of time.
Stubborn Cat Finally Using LR4We have had the litter robot for about a month now and we're struggling getting one of our cats to use it. She finally started to use it consistently after we made a small  platform around the level of the step for her to jump on to get into the litter robot. Hopefully this helps anyone else with a stubborn cat.
"LR3 Connect Sensor being weirdHey, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the app side of things that are being funky or the LR3 itself so I need someone to kinda help me troubleshoot. 

I‚Äôve had it for 10 months or so and have two cats. I‚Äôve not really changed the litter types at all and used to be able to go 4 days or so without having to change the waste bag. 

I changed it on Friday and by Saturday night/Sunday morning the app was already saying it was full. Sunday afternoon I took it apart, knocked off any loose litter on the inside by the sensor and even cleaned it off with isopropyl alcohol. I got home from work about an hour ago and checked the app and it already says 94%. Visually, it‚Äôs definitely not nearly that full and shaking it to ‚Äúlevel out‚Äù the waste doesn‚Äôt help much either. 

Also, I just reset the app gauge and manually cycled and it now says 6%. I didn‚Äôt remove the litter. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. I‚Äôve turned it off and on again, I‚Äôve taken it apart and cleaned it, I‚Äôve reset the app itself, I‚Äôve checked to make sure the bag is under the drawer line, and I‚Äôve cleaned the sensor off with isopropyl alcohol. I‚Äôm not sure what to try next."
"Success! My cats are both using it, here‚Äôs what helped.So happy my cats are using their LR4 and so far, so good. I figured I‚Äôd share what seemed to help. I have two cats, both are 10 y/o. One is a very confident male and the other is a skittish female. Both are not too picky about their litter box or type of litter, but can be a bit intimidated by electronics that move and make sound. This is their very first experience with any sort of electronic/self cleaning cat box. 

Day 1 - I did not set up LR4 in the same place as their normal litter box, because I just wanted them to get used to LR4 being in the home first. This is a bit different from LR‚Äôs advice, however it worked very well for me. I wanted them to still have their old litter box available for use, in its normal spot. This way it wouldn‚Äôt be too overwhelming for them. I hadn‚Äôt added litter into LR yet or turned LR on. Both cats just treated LR like it was a new piece of furniture. They liked the shipping box it came in more then the actual LR. 

Day 2 - Added litter and turned the LR on. Both cats seemed startled by LR rotating and making noise. This is the point at which they started having trust issues with LR. They would keep somewhat of a distance from LR and keep turning their heads to watch what LR was up to. 

Day 3 - started giving treats around LR. Even placed treats on the step and scatter shield. Was generous with petting when they took the treats from LR‚Äôs area. I had to be patient at this point and sit with them in front of LR for awhile. Would give pets throughout the rest of the day when they went close to LR. By the end of the day, I had removed some waste from their old litter box, and placed it into LR. I wanted them to go by smell to know it was a litter box. 

Day 4 - Success! My first cat (non-skittish one) used the LR successfully.  Saw him go to it multiple times in the first day. 

Day 5 - Success again. Second cat (skittish one) now using LR. 

So not too bad. Took 5 days for both cats. A little patience goes a long way. I also recommend keeping it on the 15 or 30 min. cycle, at least until your cats adjust. My next step is to get rid of the old box and place LR there instead. Im not too worried about this step since they are already comfortable with LR."

I bought a Litter Robot 3 on in December 2019, along with a 3-year warranty. A couple of months ago my litter robot developed a problem ‚Äì it consistently got stuck halfway while cycling.

When it is stuck, I can solve it by pressing the ‚Äúoff‚Äù and ‚Äúon‚Äù buttons, unplugging the power, or moving the robot a bit; then it will continue to cycle through. But now it is getting worse ‚Äì it is stuck 2-3 times during 1 cycle, so now it becomes burdensome.

**My 1st attempt** to contact [support@whisker.com](mailto:support@whisker.com) was on 9/21/2022. I sent an email with order number, purchase date and warranty information. I received no responses. **Case #00983949**

**2nd attempt** was on 9/27/2022. Received no responses. **Case #00995076**

**3rd attempt** was on 9/30/2022. No response. **#00995076**

**4th attempt** was on 10/4/2022. No response. **#01000615**

Before I post my experience on other social media, I am going to wait a few days to see if they will contact me. If not, trust me I am going to post my complaint everywhere online until I hear back from the company.

Honestly, I am very happy with my robot. I was considering buying a Litter Robot 4 for my 2nd floor. But this really ruined my experience, especially since I purchased a warranty with it.

New buyers be aware"
"Bought LR3 and I regret it. It feels I spend more time troubleshooting it than when I was scooping litter from the litter box.I got the L3 last Saturday and within the first week, it‚Äôs been nothing but trouble. I thought my issues would be training my 2 cats to use them but they started using it the next day. Day 1 was fine but as soon as Day 2, cycling was interrupted 2 times. Checked everything - mat in the front, LR3 not close to the wall, etc. Day 3 and Day 4, mid cycle interruptions again. And each time I get this notification, I have to turn the power off and then on. Day 5, the cycle was interrupted again as expected, but this time LR3 shows offline in the app after turning it on. I followed the troubleshooting guide but it didn‚Äôt help so now I don‚Äôt get notification when it stops mid cycle. Since I don‚Äôt trust LR3 not stopping mid cycle, I have to keep checking it when I‚Äôm at home and when I‚Äôm at work, I worry that my cats would end up doing the deeds somewhere in the house (or hold their pee). 

This is really frustrating. I‚Äôm experiencing issues within days after purchasing it. More so for something I paid more than $500 for and can‚Äôt get customer service to help. I can‚Äôt get someone on the phone now because of apparently unprecedented level of demand for LR4, their phones are unavailable. 

I never posted a negative review in my whole life. But today, I need somewhere to rant. And if any of you have suggestions to fix it or a better option for me, I would be grateful."
"LR3 Connect Constant Cycle InterruptionsI just purchased the LR3 Connect last week.  Within the first 24 hours, the unit began having ""cycle interrupted"" errors every single time it cycled.  Resetting the power manually resolves the issue, but it's gotten to the point now where I have to leave it off during the day and cycle manually each night because when it gets stuck there is no litter for my kitties.

Ive checked my litter levels, and its either at or below the fill line.  My LR3 is also level (it has a little unlevelness to it when it cycles due to the litter shifting).  I also dont see any obstructions anywhere.

Has anyone else experienced this and have a resolution?  I absolutely LOVE it when it works, but I cant trust it to work when Im not home to monitor it."
"Not happy with LRConnect software - they need to work on this.I‚Äôve been really happy with the litter robot for a while, but lately the software side of the connect is just not working correctly and so I can‚Äôt actually use it as an automatic box. One of our cats will occasionally watch it cycle and put her paws on the edge, triggering an over torque fault. Previously I could use my app to turn the box off and back on, which would continue the cycle and be fine. Now if I turn the robot off via the app, the app will no longer update until I physically press the reset button on the base. Even though I‚Äôve tested it and it does come back on via my app command, the app continues to just say ‚Äúoff‚Äù. So now I can‚Äôt trust the box when I‚Äôm not home. What‚Äôs the point of the remote app if it requires you to be standing there beside the unit? This is just the latest in a string of weird software issues - such as the cycle count being way off and resetting randomly. I‚Äôve tried everything. 

The product itself is fine, but they need some real help in IT."
"Don‚Äôt give up!! (Also fat cat friendly)Some tricks for anyone feeling the dread of maybe returning the LR. Be patient!! Obviously this won‚Äôt work for everyone, but it worked for us. 

1. Use a mixture of litter attractant and dirty litter from previous box. 
2. Cat nip spray. Buy it at Walmart. It helps the box seem more appealing 
3. After a few days, calmly place cats in LR and reassure them with lots of treats. Obviously don‚Äôt force them if they are scared. Give them a lot of reassurance. 
4. Let the old litter box get nasty. 
5. If they still use the old box when it‚Äôs nasty, go cold turkey! I was so worried about doing the cold turkey method but it worked out just fine. 
6. I‚Äôm waiting another week before I let them see a cycle, but they have heard the noises from me manually cycling it. 

Hope this helps! 

ALSO if anyone has a 22 pound cat, don‚Äôt worry... they fit lmao I bought the ramp for her though. 

Another trick I forgot to mention is cat grass! You can buy it at pet stores or Walmart too. It grows within a few days and cats love it. I placed it next to the LR and they started hanging out next to it a lot. 

Don‚Äôt give up! Be patient. This thing is amazing and worth the patience. Trust the process and read up on it."
"Please fix Sleep mode!The litter robot when on sleep timer just will come on no matter what at that time. A cat can be in the litter robot and the thing just runs a cycle! The timer should still take priority, I had a cat in the robot when the wake up time started....

I've used it for awhile (the sleep timer) but never encountered what I woke up to today. The robot wakes up at 6:15am and cycles. Never thought to much about it, kind of a alarm lol. Anyway this morning I woke up before 6am and was just chilling in bed till around 6:14am, when one of my cats decided it was time to go #2. The robot woke up, started cycling while she was finishing and she had to hop out while cleaning started. 

Luckily she trusts me and has sense went back in to finish up, but its a problem, no? 

The timer should let the go button know not to run or something??? I mean if it was #1 it would be a horrible clean up event at least 1st thing when waking up. Also she could of got hurt if she was older and not able to get out of the way. That would of really ruined my life for awhile....

Anyway should be a easy fix to have the timer run when sleep timer is run I think? I won't be using this (sleep timer) till its fixed though after this event. Really have it go from not on to back to sensor at least but more complicated would be to always run the cat presence senor as a priority with the timer. 

Thanks and for everyone else I'd suggest leaving the sleep timer off till this is fix"
"Smell and reliabilityI have 2 Maine coons with most stinky poop ever.  I tried clumping litter, tide breeze system- smell is bad. ( vet is not useful, cats are healthy, just some more stinky than others)

I am thinking about switching to litter robot.

First question- will it help with the smell? I hope it will but I am not sure how big improvement to except. Is lr4 better model for stink?

Second - I read here a lot about issues with the robot. Is it the case what happy users don‚Äôt post or I need to expect to replace robot in a year?"
"LR3 reliability - at sh*t's endIt seems on a weekly basis I get both a pinch sensor and bonnet alert. Everytime I do the LR suggest led fix for both but after a few days of working without issue, these things still pop up! I just want the LR to go one week without any error messages.

I'm sick and tired of this! For several hundreds of dollars we paid for this piece of machinery the reliability is awful. How Whisker thought it would be a good idea to bring this (which is the 3rd generation, obviously) to market is mind boggling.

I have no interest in paying $85 for a new bonnet and whatever part to fix the pinch error. I just want to drive the LR to a field and go Office Space on it.

For those who bought the LR4, is it any better?"
"Reliable automated litterbox options available in the EU?I've been waiting for months for the LR4 to release Iin Europe, but it seems there's no fixed date yet. I just spoke with customer service and they think early 2023 is a good estimate but can't make promises. 

Two major reasons we waited for the LR4 instead of buying the LR3 is the larger opening (our cats seem to prefer that) and the larger waste bin (since we have three cats and it'd fill up quickly otherwise).

I'd rather not wait a whole lot longer, since we're dealing with some stuff that's making it difficult for us to stay on top of the litterbox situation. At the same time, it's a big purchase, and I don't want to end up regretting it in a year and either needing to stick with an unsatisfactory product or buying the LR4 anyway.

With that in mind, I wanted to see what people might recommend. Waiting for LR4? Going with the LR3 anyway? Another brand? A number of the litterbox alternatives I see mentioned here, like Leo's Loo Too, aren't available in Europe, so I thought an EU-specific thread might be handy."
"Is it worth it?Thinking about getting one for my two cats but I am struggling with the large financial commitment. Does anyone have any regrets or had any problems with the machine? My fear is that it will stop working in two years and I will have to replace it. I am open to any suggestions as for specific model, etc. that would be reliable. Also, I am wondering if anyone has experience with another machine that is comprable or better value - or is the LR generally considered the best? Thanks!"
"Looking for a LR - need advicesI never had the LR. Just waited to pull the trigger for too long. Prior experience with electronics taught me that top of the line is usually not the best. So I have a few questions: 
- for a newbie, what model would you recommend? Most reliable? Easy to setup and use? The easiest one? 
- I don‚Äôt need it to work with Alexa or wi-fi unless it is a must. Comcast is sketchy in our area. The fewer setups, the better. Need an easy thing which would fit into out toilet and not scare the cat. She is small-medium, 6 years of age. 
- is Amazon a good source? Usually it is OK except for cosmetics.
- for the first buy, besides the LR itself, do I need to buy something else? 

Any advise would be sincerely appreciated."
"LR3 ""cat sensor"" calibration or alternatives needed!This is an over-designed and under-engineered design, and WAY overcomplicated for what it is doing.   


The simple switch method from the LR2 ""just worked"" and I guess that was too easy for the company, because the logic program in this new one is infuriating for no benefit in functionality. The pressure sensor has variable resistance, and it must be within a range (which I saw once on the internet and have been unable to relocate since) rather than being a simple switch again.   


If the resistance is too high or too low, the stupid thing just blinks at you and doesn't work at all. This is what happens when the sensor fails - ok, that's no big issue, it wore out. Doesn't matter that I have LR2 units that are easily 3 times as old still working without a single part replacement.... So I replace the sensor. And it works for about 2 days, then is blinking randomly and stopping the functions AGAIN in mid cycle! Try to adjust it - lighter tension. Fast yellow and no function. More tension - Again fast yellow and no function!   


Seriously. WTAF. This is NONSENSE. It is a dang switch! It reads ""more weight arrived"" and sets the timer, or it sits there waiting. It isn't ""weighing"" the cat in this design, and THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD BUY THE NEW ONE BECAUSE I DON'T NEED THAT ADDING TO THE COMPLEXITY! Seriously Whisker / Litter Robot.... Stay in your lane. We need a globe that detects the cat and sets the timer, LIKE IT USED TO BE, and then does the sifting for us. That's all!

Has anyone found a RELIABLE way to calibrate this, with actual metered resistance numbers? FYI: ""the length of the bolt"" is NOT IT. I've tried all those and all I get is blinkblinkblinkblink.... NO. There has to be another way."
"Best auto litter box for larger cat?I've been considering...

* PETKIT PuraMax
* Litter Robot 3 (4 is too expensive for me)
* PetSafe ScoopFree Complete Plus

My primary needs are..

* Decent space for my larger cat \~15 lbs (I'd really like him to be comfortable if I'm spending all this money)
* Good  odor control for my smaller apartment (I don't mind something I have to  clean weekly, but I like the auto-scooping especially when  entertaining)

Other considerations...

* The PetSafe box is a lot cheaper up front, but the others may justify their price over time with cheaper litter?
* Something that's relatively quiet would be nice
* I generally choose reliability over extra features and sensors. Smart Home connection is neat, but not necessary.

Thanks in advance!"
What features do you want to see added to the next generation of Litter Robot?
"Litter robot 4 vs Leo's loo too early thoughtsLittle background on two cats I have :

I am new to automatic litter solution since my first 6 year old cat (Sphynx ) liked to use our toilet since she was 4 months old. I only started to appreciate how smart she is when we got another kitten which does not have the same level of intelligence. So after three attempts to train the new cat and finding shit all over my house I gave up. Here come robots.

Purchased Leo's loo too a month ago. Both of my cats started using it from the moment I turned it on. I was not concerned with the smart one since she obviously prefer sand over toilet seat. The new cat also is using it without any issues. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them take a shit and get notifications on it for some odd reason. More on that later. A month in on it, the core function of this robot works as advertised. I mean not a single snag. I have yet to clean it or change the litter in it. The weight function is spotty and not reliable enough to tell the difference between the two cats. They have 4 pound difference and I still can't really tell who went for it.  That's about it.  The only issue was that I had Leo's loo too on the second floor of my house and my cats had second litter box on the first floor. Solution was to get another toy for me and my cats. So obvious choice is to get the same Leos loo too robot and add it on my app. However, Robot 4 adds few more interesting features which Leo does not. I was still concerned about all the reported issues litter robot 4 users had with hardware and software. I still went for it given that Whisker has 90 days return policy and I can send it back.

So I ordered Litter robot 4. for those who are interested , Whisker (Litter -Robot 4 ) had 3-5 day shipping on their site at the time of the order. It ended up being 7 days till it was delivered.

Opened it up and went through the set up within few minutes. Both cats yet again took immediate interest and both relieved themselves in the orderly fashion. No burn in period at all. Both dropped the Duce right away.

I own Leos loo too for a month. I have Litter robot for few days.

Features which **Robot 4** has an upper leg on Leo's loo too:

A. Dumping old sand into the waist bin. This is a big one since you would have to drag Leo;s globe out and find creative way to get rid of the litter without making a mess. While setting up I had to dump clean litter and saw this feature worked perfectly. That's a win for Robot 4.

B. Bigger opening to get in and out - looks like they don't seem to mind jumping in smaller or bigger opening.

C. Waist bin level monitoring - so far it is showing accurate level. Leo's loo does not have that option.

Features which **Leo's loo too** has over Robot 4

UV light  - It is too early to tell how Robot 4 will perform in the smell department , but Leos loo too does not smell at all even with the full bin of waist. It actually smells like an expensive air freshener.  I don't know if it's a UV light that controls the oder so well or/and the design which isolates waist bin from the globe's opening. I mean I could have put it in the kitchen next to the dining table and still be happy with it. I will wait for a month and update this thread on the smell situation for Robot 4.

&#x200B;

Issues so far :

Leo's loo too - none

Robot 4  - as I took that thing out of the box and went through the first few cleaning cycles, I did face an issue with the hard clicking sound. Felt like a mechanical issue with the rotation mechanism. I was laughing that it had to happen on the first day given all the reviews I have read prior to ordering it.

Someone else had the same issue here : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV\_hVTHRw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV_hVTHRw)

So I did some quick research and it ended up being a small issue with the fence causing friction and coming into contact with the plastic piece on the globe while it is rotating during cleaning cycle. I posted my solution here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking\_sound\_when\_rotating\_lr\_4/jcqbxby/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking_sound_when_rotating_lr_4/jcqbxby/?context=3)

Not sure if it is a positive point, but robot 4 has ton of support discussions online. I feel like most of the issues will be easy to find and resolve them on your own. Not so much for Leo's loot too. I don't think Leo's loo too is just perfect and hence has no wide issues coverage online. It may be just a much newer product.

Missing function on both Robots: Email notification/ SMS

\- My boss made fun of me for buying robot and not scooping the old fashion way. He is usually on my case for buying too many tech gadgets. I only told him about one robot btw. So I have been taking screenshots of push notifications on my cat's bowel movement activity and sending it to him via text message. Wish there was an email/sms solution so I can automate this task.

I will update again in few months."
"I wish the feeder robot played a voice message like many other less expensive automated feeders do.As stated.   The feeder robot is the most reliable and best feeder we have owned and the app is great too. We especially like that we have one app for the LR4 and the Feeder bot, I just wish it played out voices to the cats when they are being fed."
"How much better are the later models than the 1st gen? Is the build quality better? I have 2x 1st gen LR's, and it seems like I'm always having to tinker to keep one or the other working reliably. I've had to replace multiple sensors, wiring looms, 1x motor, 1x circuit board.I compare the build quality of the non plastic parts to that of something made in someone's garage. I was very surprised how cheaply they were built considering the cost. Nothing is water (urine) proof, the motors quicky start rusting, as do the components of the sensor directly under the globe (I'm not even sure what that one is for). I've also had urine get into the circuit boards. The spring in the front sensors always fail after a while. The felt strips always come off after a while etc. The hall effect sensors have to be brushed out every 2nd day or so or they won't cycle properly. Is it worth upgrading to a new model, or do others report similar grievances on those also? Thanks for your opinions."
"Litter Robot 4 not re-connecting to WifiHi everyone,

I have the LR4 and have an issue with the WiFI connection. Pretty frequently, it loses connection overnight. I have my router configured to reboot every night at something like 4-5am which helps with overall network stability, so I suspect that the LR4 is failing to reconnect when the reboot happens.

It's the only device on my network that has this issue, and this nightly reboot keeps my wireless network extremely reliable. I work from home, and prior to configuring things this way, my Wifi would occasionally go down during the workday (which always seemed to happen in meetings), so turning this reboot off isn't really an option.

Turning the LR off/on fixes the issue, but I generally don't notice this happens until the LR gets stuck upside down during a cleaning cycle and the cat has pooped on the floor.

I don't know that I'm expecting anyone here to have answers, but I'm wondering if anyone has run into this kind of issue and has a fix/workaround. I'm technically savvy, so have no issue doing some kind of manual configuration in my router if there's a solution.

I'm going to see if configuring the LR4 with a dedicated IP in my router does anything, but does anyone have any other suggestions?  


UPDATE:  
I've configured my LR4 to have a dedicated local IP in my router. Since doing this, it hasn't failed to reconnect.  


So if anyone finds themselves in the same situation and has the know-how to configure it, it is an option. "
"what is the source of noise in the litter robot three?I have heard alot of bad things about the LR4, it just doesn't strike me as all that reliable from what I have read on reddit. Which makes the LR3 seem so much more appealing. The only thing that turns me off of the LR3 is the noise, does anyone know why it is so noisy? Is it a property of the motor, perhaps maybe a gearing thing? Is it friction between the golde and the base? This seems like a very solvable problem so has anyone tried?"
"Having tons of issues on the LR4 and its only a week oldSo is it just me, or does each Litter Robot keep getting less reliable with each generation? I had a LR2 that lasted a really really long time and was practically bulletproof until something started to warp and while it still works, it often gets off the tracks. LR3 was reliable for about 6 months and then became extremely problematic, stopping most of its cycles half way through. Replaced almost every part in there and still doesn't work. Ordered a LR4 hoping they had made something more like the LR2 this time but bigger and with all the tech. Nope. This thing is flimsy AF. The bonnet will not stay on it. I keep getting sensor errors on the app. And this morning I found a small plastic piece in the drawer, still not sure where it broke off from or how.   


I put in a support request today, but honestly I think I might just return this. It's absurd that this thing costs as much as a decent washing machine and is built so cheaply."
"'Unexpected Error' - Cannot connect LR4 to app via BluetoothI can't seem to find any solutions to the issue mentioned...I finally get the LR4 after months of backlog, then the app connection to the unit doesn't work. There doesn't seem to be any other option than to connect via Bluetooth, so that's not helpful. 

I've seen that others are also having this same issue, even after trying all of the things suggested (hard reset, close app, blah, blah, blah), which do not work. It's something within the unit that isn't picking up the Bluetooth signal. Tried everything imaginable, to no avail.

So far, not impressed and seems like an overpriced item that isn't going to be reliable.

Pluses: Quieter than the LR3...that's about it so far.

The fact that Litter Robot doesn't seem to have offered any resolutions is not comforting. I'll be contacting them again and may just return the whole thing since the advertised features don't work."
"my solution for a defect sensorMy LR3 stops to sense the cat pooping events correctly.  Tried to reset many times.  Not working.  I know the sensor is not reliable even you fix it.

So I just connect LR3 to IFTTT and Alexa.   Schedule three routines to clean at sunrise, noon and sunset.   My cat usually use LR for about 3 to 5 times a day and I know my cat is smart enough not to touch the LR when it is running.

My next step is to connect a motion sensor in the LR directly.

Now, I am not worrying about LR stop working for a whole day now. "
"LR4 first month: So many issues make me want to return itI ordered the LR4 even before I adopted my cat because of the long wait. Now it finally arrived and after more than 2 weeks of use, I already want to return it:

&#x200B;

1. WiFi randomly gets disconnected and it does not reconnect. I needed to turn it off and back on, or sometimes even redo the onboarding process. This happens more than once a day making the whole point of ""no scooping"" not true anymore, especially combined with the second point below. Oh, and if you are away from home, you have no way to get it back online and worst case scenario your cat loses the toilet.
2. \[Probably biggest dealbreaker\] Let's talk about reliability... one time the app shows ""Clean Cycle Complete"", but when I checked it was like halfway in the cycle - like, you can see the poop bag underneath. This means, if I did not notice it and did not reset it in time, my cat would have no toilet. And the app basically just lied to you. This one instance paranoid me so I am checking it regularly to make sure it was in the right state.
3. ""No scoop"" is a maybe, but ""no intervention"" is a lie. About HALF of the time, LR does not clean the poop. It is either stuck on the side, stuck on the net (the part that separates litter and poop), stuck on the edge of the litter pan on the silicon portion, or even outside on the step. My cat is relatively big (15 lb) but never got litter chunks out of the litter box before. Though it happened quite often with LR. \[Edit: comments say that delaying the cycle could fix some of the stuck clumps. I can see it fixes the plastic portions, but I am not convinced it's going to fix the silicon portion, but I will give it another week\]
4. Negative odor control. I am using the same litter (Arms & Hammer) as I used with a traditional litter box, it smells a lot worse. I actually like the smell of the raw litter (out of the box) but LR somehow removed the fresh litter smell and kinda emphasized the poop smell... 
5. The app is not very useful. The history is not complete if the cycle happens during the time it disconnects with Wifi. - Yes, even if it is back online there's no chance you get your data back! Also, the app does not refresh itself. After a cycle is finished, you need to manually refresh the page a few times to see the latest stats. No refresh no new data. It feels very awkward.  Combine with 1 you basically cannot treat the app seriously anymore...

I did not check the details about the return policy because I thought after so many generations this should be a good product now. Now I want to return it and saw that you need to pay a $75 shipping fee to return it. Is it worth $75 and the whole hassle to try this out? If I knew there would be so many issues I wouldn't try in the first place. Probably on me that I didn't do enough research. But I figured I'd still post it to see if any of these could be resolved or if any of these could help others when making the decision.

&#x200B;

Edit: Added a few more details. Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I will give it another week. "
"Should I hold off on purchasing a Litter Robot 4?I always wanted a litter robot as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone when I say cleaning up cat poop is the worst part of owning a cat. With the release of the LR4, I was very interested in purchasing one but this is what gathered in less than 30 minutes of searching Reddit for an answer:

The liner is thin and tears easily. 
The charcoal filter needs to sit correctly or it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit not on a perfectly flat 180 degree surface, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the litter is too heavy or too light, it won‚Äôt work. 
If there is too much litter or too little litter, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit is facing a window, it won‚Äôt work. 
If you have indoor security cameras with night vision, it won‚Äôt work. 
The chances of getting a machine that actually works in the first place isn‚Äôt too high and a lot of you are on your second LR4 unit already. 

The list goes on, and I‚Äôm truly wondering: is this nearly $700 machine truly worth it? If I‚Äôm paying that much for anything, I expect it to work without much troubleshooting and be reliable for a reasonable amount of time. Or should I hold off to see if any of these issues are addressed?"
"2nd replacement DFI & pinch kit installed today - LR3\~3.5 years later and just replaced the DFI & pinch kit again,   first time it was a pinch sensor issue and this time it was erroneous drawer full that cleaning the sensors was not correcting.  It appears the drawer full sensors have been redesigned,  hopefully for better reliability.   With 3 cats it seems they only last 1-1.5 years before the corrosion causes faults. 

Anyhow I am going to buy another kit (maybe 2) to keep on standby for next 1-1.5 years when this set goes bad,  don't want to wait just in case they discontinue the kit down the road.   They are only $30 and seem to be the achilles heel of the LR3 so if I can keep my LR3 going for another 2-3 years with a couple kits its better than spending major coin for a new unit (LR3 is now more expensive than when I bought 3.5 years ago).   My ROI for the unit will be acceptable to me if I get another year or two out of the unit.

"I thought this was supposed to *reduce* the amount of time/effort I spend on the litterbox.I cannot get my LR4 to work reliably enough I can even consider removing the other litterboxes.

Brand new LR4, set up on Monday.

* On laminate floor, no mat/carpet underneath
* Not touching the walls
* Using Dr. Elsey Ultra clumping cat litter
* Filled about 1cm under the fill line
* No nearby IR sources
* Firmware & app fully updated

It gets a ""Cat Detected"" error (usually twice) during at least 2/3 of the cycles, but manages to finish, taking about 5 minutes for a clean cycle. It's lost the plot every single night via ""Cat Sensor Fault"", twice leaving it stuck with the hellmouth to the drawer left open for hours. After that I put it on a sleep cycle overnight, so at least it'd remain usable. Cat Sensor Faults constantly. Last night I got a ""Cat Sensor Fault"" notification at midnight, smack in the middle of the sleep cycle & when I checked on it in the morning it took 3 manual interventions to get the cycle completed.

I've cleaned the sensors, I've taken off the bonnet & reseated the dome, I've sat & watched it cycle more times than I ever wanted to.

Does this get better? Is there more I need to do to dial it in? What could possibly be causing so many false positive sensor issues in a brand-new, barely-used product?"
"For a $650 Product Under Warranty its Got to be the Worst Customer Experience Ever!My litter-robot hasn‚Äôt been operational for over 3 months. I‚Äôve received absolutely no support from the company Whisker after sending various forms of correspondence to your organization asking for assistance. I‚Äôve made exhaustive self help searches on Whisker customer support pages - read Whisker support instructions, viewed numerous You-Tube videos, searched/ researched/ read many WEB pages and it appears the robot cannot be fixed. The Whisker organization doesn‚Äôt have the interest in helping me and the product is under warranty. 

In late July, I called customer support and was put on hold. After over an hour, I selected the ‚Äúcall-back‚Äù feature. After two weeks I had not received a call-back, I called Whisker several times believing no-contact was an aberration, thinking surely no reputable Business would disregard their customers. After each of these calls I was put on hold. I wasn‚Äôt going to do the ‚ÄúNO CALL BACK‚Äù Option so on 8/10 I submitted a support ticket (00917433). Two weeks later (8/25) a Whisker email requested I send the litter-box SN (LR3CI378274). Hey, I used the SN to create the ticket! I was unable to respond to the Whisker email in the time-frame Whisker stipulated, and my case was dropped. I replied with an email on 9/4 letting Whisker know I didn't see the email in time, and needed assistance. Guess what? I still haven‚Äôt heard back from that email. Since the litter box is under warranty, I thought maybe Whisker would prefer to complete a refund of my order (#100805315). I submitted a refund request on 10/5. Guess what? I still have not received a call, letter or email.  

To be clear, I‚Äôm able to get the robot working one cycle at a time. However, the robot continues to loop through the two messages (1) pinch fault and (2) Box Full. The pan isn‚Äôt full. It has one clump in it. To get the box working, I‚Äôve gone through a series of steps numerous times. I‚Äôm able to clear the error messages and ready the box for my cat. He uses the box **once** maybe twice before I have to ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù the sensors and box. It takes about an hour to get the box ready, and only about 2 minutes to manually scoop. I finally gave up and unplugged the beast (not the cat). Here are the onerous steps I take each time to ready the box.  

A Pinch fault error causes the contraption to be inoperable 

1. I deep clean the globe, remove all stuck waste, brush, and vacuum litter out of base including the pinch detectors, reassemble and reset. The litter box message states ""ready. 
2. This deep clean process takes nearly an hour. I have to move the Globe outside the house because because all the litter sits up underneath the globe (on top), and I have to rock the globe back and forth to the litter to fall out. A big mess in the house the first time. 
3. My cat uses the box **once,** the robot cycles and the message ‚Äúbox full‚Äù is immediately received. The box has one clump!!
4. I dump the single clump from the pan, Ready the box, the cat uses **Once**, and the message ‚Äúpinch detected‚Äù is received. Its back to dragging the contraption outside again
5. I do another deep-clean and ready the box. The box indicates good to go (‚ÄúReady‚Äù)
6. Steps above (1-6) are repeated each and every time my cat uses the box
7. The box in its current state is not operational and is unplugged.

"LR3 issues getting ""stuck"" upside down for no reasonHi, LR3 Connected. Have had for a little over 2 years and love it. Works great w/two cats.

Getting the dreaded ""lets get stuck upside down with no litter"", which we at least get reliable ""clean cycle interrupted"" messages.

It's obviously after one of our two cats does their thing, but no cat or anything goes into the LR. I just observed. Cleaned it a month ago, so everything is fairly tidy and no sensor blocked.

Is there a way to debug this besides coming upstairs to a treat from our male cat? Our female usually acts funny and howls, I assume because she holds it in.

To reset? We have to un-plug and then hope when you re-plug, the bin goes into ""reset"" mode and can find the 0 datum on the rotating part. Sometimes, it requires multiple unplug<->plug, reset, cycles to get this to happen though."
"When to remove old litterbox?Hello, my kitten has used the litterbot in front of me and when I'm not looking but also still uses the dirty litterbox (which I stopped cleaning to get her to use the new litterbot). When is a good time to reliably take the old litterbox away and solely rely on the litterbot? I was thinking of just doing it now since she uses it but sometimes I catch her sitting in it and doing nothing."
"LR4: Cat Sensor Faults and Offline Errors?Hi Litter Robot Enthusiasts,

Sorry for the long post. I received my Litter Robot 4 a few days ago. This is my first Litter Robot and I was very excited when it arrived, but I've been having some frustrating errors.

1. **Cat Sensor Faults:** This happens a few times per day.  Initially, it may have been because I didn't properly ""zero"" the scale by pressing the Reset button when I filled the litter, but I now press the Reset button frequently and I still get Cat Sensor Faults daily.  I think my cat maybe spends >2 mins inside when he uses the box, which triggers the Cat Sensor Fault. This is a problem because sometimes the machine just doesn't cycle at all after a Cat Sensor Fault.  For example, last night I had a Cat Sensor Fault at 10:59PM and when I woke up at 7AM today the machine hadn't cycled (FYI the cat was nowhere near the machine at this point), so I had to manually start the cycle.  **Is there a way to get the machine to reliably cycle once it has had a Cat Sensor Fault?**
2. **Offline**: For the past 2 days, my Litter Robot has randomly gone ""offline.""  When it's offline, I'm unable to use the app to cycle the robot (although interestingly I still get some notifications in the app like ""Cat Detected"").  I don't think it's a problem with my home WiFi, since my WiFi is working fine on my other devices.  In order to resolve the error, I have to unplug the machine and then plug it in again. **Has anyone encountered issues with the machine going offline and what the problem could be?**

I find these 2 errors together very troubling because if I were to go away for a weekend and there's a Cat Sensor Fault alone, then I could hypothetically still use the app to cycle to the robot.  But if there's both a Cat Sensor Fault and an Offline error, then I worry the machine won't cycle at all for the whole weekend (since I can't be there to physically unplug the machine).

FYI I'll also reach out to Whisker via chat.  

Thanks in advance, Reddit community!"
"I see a number of posts here regarding wi-fi connection. If a LR3 cannot connect to the wi-fi, will it cease to function properly? What problems can a lack of wi-fi cause? Also, how does cleaning work?I have a reliable wireless internet signal, but I also live in the countryside and a storm, strong wind, or heavy snowfall can knock out my wi-fi for a day or two. Would this prevent an LR3 from functioning?

I also notice a lot of posts about manually cleaning the machine. How often does this tend to be required, and how much effort/time does it usually take? Will I need to spend 2 hours wiping cat pee from the inside of a mechanical chamber twice a month?

Thank you"
"[UK] Wait for LR4 or get LR3C now?From what I‚Äôve read on this sub the LR4 might be available in the UK before the end of the year. The sub‚Äôs also full of complaints about problems with it (in particular the sensors not working when it‚Äôs placed on carpet, which would apply to me). 

Is it worth waiting for the LR4 and dealing with potential problems with it (knowing that there‚Äôs a massive customer support backlog) or would you just buy an LR3C now?

Also, does anyone have any experience with the Homebridge plugin? I was thinking I‚Äôd make HomeKit trigger an air purifier for 15 minutes when the occupancy sensor fired and am wondering if it‚Äôs reliable enough."
"Warranty length decreased from 3 years to 1I've been wanting to get an LR for a while but I figured they'd be coming out with a new model soon so I waited. One of the things that drew me to this product was the 3-year warranty that was included before.
Now with the LR 4, it looks like you only get a 1 year warranty included and you have to pay $100 to upgrade it to 3 year. Did this just change? I hope they're not expecting reliability issues with this model."
"Has anyone bypassed the DFI? I would be willing to guess it can be bypassed with the right resistor.It works for now but I don't know for how long so I'd rather just bypass how than have to deal with replacing on an ongoing basis. I've already bypassed the bonnet sensor because of a failed led module (twice failed...). I am going to bypass the pinch sensor when I bypass the DFI and will consider bypassing the cat sensor too.

I simply want to have the litter robot more reliable. It's about 5 years old and I'm always having to reset it via home assistant or a smart outlet when it goes offline or has a fault. I'm trying to eliminate as many reasons for it to stop upside downnor not run for an extended period of time as I can.

Wife approval factor has been going down since it stops for every single fault and it's about once a month I have to rotate manually and it's a pain."
"I HATE trying to onboard this effing thing to the internet...For the amount of money this thing cost me, it sure seems to be buggy AF... I follow the directions, but the litter robot wifi doesn't come up reliably, and when it does, it hangs at the last step of onboarding, and it wouldn't matter much except I have to use the app to reset (ie, turn off and back on) the thing 5 times a day to get it to cycle correctly...

For half a grand, I'm surprised it's not a smoother experience."
"Replacing the DFI on a LR3 Connect (Kit) with laser, not IR, DFII've had a LR3 for many years now and have had little to no problems.

Last year, I bought the kit to upgrade my LR3 to a LR3 Connect with the Wi-Fi and app. Again, no problems.

Unfortunately, this year, my DFI (drawer full indicator) sensors have acted up and no matter how much I clean them, reset them, and follow the Support video advice, the dreaded blinking blue light always appear after a cycle and won't disappear until I Reset.

So I believe I need to replace the sensors.

Here's the thing: [on the litter robot e-commerce shop, the only DFI kit available seems to be the Infrared Version](https://www.litter-robot.com/shop-all-products/lr3-pinch-contact-dfi-kit.html).

However, [support articles have seem to suggest that the Laser Version is more reliable than the infrared version](https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/lr3-dfi-laser-or-ir/69807) (less parts to manfunction). So I want the Laser Version.

The support articles seem to indicate that the Laser Version only works with the Wi-Fi Connect versions of LR3.

So I have two questions:

1. Is it possible to buy or get the Laser Version of the DFI?
2. Although my LR3 was originally a non-WiFi version and currently has IR DFI, I upgraded it with a kit to the Wi-Fi Connect version. Can I replace the IR DFI with Laser DFI as I have a Wi-Fi Connect version (via upgrade)?"
Flashing blue light to rapid yellowI replaced my dfi and pinch detectors 4 months ago and now when I turn on my lr3 I get a flashing blue even if the drawer is not in. When I hit reset it then goes to the rapid flashing yellow lights. I‚Äôm really getting tired of fixing this thing. A $500 litter box should be way more reliable.
"DOA Litter Robot 3Hi, just venting.

I spent way too much money on this thing, and waited far too long with multiple shipping delays, for it to be literally nonfunctional out of the box. Very disappointed, because it is now a massive waste of space in my home, and I'm not even sure if the support team will get to me within the return window at this point.

The bonnet is in place. The key is in place. I've tried cycling the machine both with litter and with nothing in it. It turns like an inch and then I get a flashing yellow light. I don't have the WiFi model because, well, it's a fucking litterbox, why on Earth anyone would spend $50 more to have a cat toilet that talks to you seems asinine. How naive I was. Now, I don't know what the issue is. Now, I know why they upcharge for this feature -- because these things break, apparently.

Was much happier with my LR1 which provided many years of reliable service and I'm sad to have gotten rid of it."
"Cat uses LR before it's done cyclingWe've had the LR for about 3 weeks now and one (of two) cats has this habit that's driving me insane where the LR cycles and it's about halfway done where it starts to pour the litter back onto the bed. He then jumps in, starts pawing at the flap that's currently holding back the litter like an absolute madman (creating a lot of noise). The LR then usually stops the cycle, so the bed is at an angle and contains only a portion of the litter. But there's something about the cycle that triggers him to want to poop (now that I think about it it's always poop, not pee) and he starts pooping in the slanted and half empty bed. It's not a huge problem but 1) this behavior doesn't trigger a new cycle so the poop gets left behind until a cycle is triggered by something else and 2) it's pretty gross because the poop rolls around against his paws and body because of the angle, and I can imagine the whole situation can also be a bit stress inducing for him. 

I kinda wish the cycle wouldn't stop when it's at this point when a cat jumps in as I doubt he would attempt this shenanigans if the thing is in motion. As far as I can tell there isn't anything dangerous that could happen (and it's not like the cat sensor is that reliable anyway) so I'd feel pretty comfortable with it continuing its cycle. He'll just stand in the bed and go along for a ride and do his business when it's done.

Anyone else experience behavior like this?"
"LR3 won‚Äôt auto cycle consistentlyI‚Äôve been waking up in the morning and noticing there is pee/poo in my LR3 which discourages one of my 2 cats to not use the box (see cycle timeline pic). I‚Äôm not sure how this keeps happening and I‚Äôm looking for some tips. 

I‚Äôve verified the following already
- Pushing down on the unit does trigger the scale and the unit does auto cycle after whenever I do it
- I do reset scale after every litter change etc..
- I‚Äôm pretty sure the litter I‚Äôm using isn‚Äôt too light 
- Tried hard reset 
- Changed auto cycle timer to 3min (might change back to 7 to see if that changes anything) 

I‚Äôm wondering if one cat goes in, does their business and triggers the sensor. Then the other cat goes it and somehow prevents the auto cycle? 

Will the LR3 refuse to auto cycle if it detects a weight still inside? And shouldn‚Äôt it just auto cycle whenever that weight leaves?

Trying to troubleshoot, my one cat keeps peeing on the floor I need help bad üòÇüòÇ"
"Issues with LRF - optimal litter but there's not much, don't get consistent notifications, randomly goes offlineHi all,

I'm very close to just returning the LR4 and annoyed with all the issues ive been experiencing.

I've had it setup for about a week now. 

When I left for work the other day I noticed it was still stuck in sleep mode, when selecting to change the mode it states it's offline, did my cat manually turn it off? This happened twice.

I don't get any notifications whenever the robot is being used or cleaned, contacted CS they sent me an email but did not reply, it's been 4 days...

Anyone experience these issues before? Doesn't seem right for a machine that's so expensive. I know some people swear by these robots but I'm having nothing but problems. 

Another important issue is within the app it shows there is optimal litter but when looking in the robot it is severely low. Is this normal? I hVe t seen the optimal status change once... I do see the level was lower than 50 in the app but still read as optimal litter...

Super annoyed."
"LR4 has consistently stopped at this exact spot during a cycle. This is while it is on its way back to normal position after dumping waste. I cleaned the sensors and dumped the waste bin last night, didn't fix it. Any ideas why it is doing this? (yes, I know I need to clean the inside)"
"When to get rid of second litter box?Hey y‚Äôall!

Seems to have worked as they‚Äôre pretty consistently going into the LR. Can anyone provide some insight as to when to get rid of the old box?

"Terrible Customer Service and Fails to DeliverAfter seeing all the reviews that said emailing customer support would take weeks to receive a response I decided to brave the phone in support wait times. I was on hold for an hour and a half and finally made it up to 2nd in line for support before the service dropped my call. I immediately called back and was told (by a prerecording) that I was calling outside of their business hours, despite it being thirty minutes before their supposed closing time and the fact that I had called well over two hours before the end of business hours. Incredibly frustrating experience just to get help with the problems of the actual machine.

The robot itself does not work. It worked fine for the first month before requiring a manual cycle every time I wanted the litter to be changed. Then when I attempt a manual cycle, the cat sensor incorrectly goes off pretty consistently and the robot gets stuck upside down with the hole directly over the waste drawer, making it impossible for the cats to use. After wasting 30 minutes (daily!!) pressing buttons, turning on and off the machine, unplugging the machine, and consulting their manual for whatever color light indicator is flashing (and then consulting it again when the light color combo changes after following the instructions and it still not working) SOMETIMES the robot will reset to its original position before my cats use it and I start the entire process over again the next day. Additionally despite following all of the instructions for emptying the waste drawer (hitting reset after taking it out, etc.) the sensor constantly detects the drawer as being full despite it being completely empty. I ultimately just use a normal litter box in tandem with this machine which makes me wonder why I paid as much as I did in the first place if I‚Äôm still scooping litter and constantly trouble shooting a finicky, sensitive, and useless device."
"Cat won‚Äôt use consistentlyMy partner purchased the LR3 last year when our cat stopped using her other automatic litter box, and while it took some time for her to adjust, she eventually began using it regularly. However, over the last year, there have been about 2 instances where she just stops using it and instead will meow to go outside or has peed on the floor or the couch. She isn‚Äôt an outdoor cat, but goes outside with supervision and I‚Äôve rarely seen her go potty outside. She will use the LR if you place her in it (which I‚Äôve started to do) but otherwise she really isn‚Äôt using it on her own. I have no idea what could be frustrating her about it, or if she‚Äôs just forgetting it‚Äôs there? We cleaned it thoroughly about a month ago, and last week I used wipes to clean the inside of the globe. Still, no regular use on her own. Has anybody else experienced this? Any tips?? I‚Äôm pulling my hair out over here!"
"Frustrated is an understatementSo about once a week the robot 4 gets a cat sensor fault at 1 am . I‚Äôm asleep and don‚Äôt see it and the cats use the rest of the house as a cat box.

I spent over $900 for a cat box that my cats can‚Äôt use consistently and they pee and poop all over the house when it faults.
I also had contacted whisker about the liner the cats scratched through. I submitted a ticket and didn‚Äôt hear back so I had to contact them again I was lucky to get through via chat and the rep was great and sent me a new liner but I shouldn‚Äôt of had to chase them down for the issue. I had even purchased the extended warranty. 

Not to mention no matter what litter I use it just cakes up on the liner and I have to deep clean it once a week and scrap the caked on pee.
It seems at this point I‚Äôm spending more time and energy deep cleaning and cleaning up pee around the house than I would be if I kept the traditional cat box."
"Just got off the phone with support--I'm scheduled to get my 3rd LR4 (2nd replacement). Heed my advice.I don't know why it happens, and I don't know how to fix it (if there is an engineer out there who has reverse-engineered their LR4 and can share some information, I would love to hear from you), but these LR4's seem to work fine immediately out of the box, for a couple of months, and then the issues start to appear. This first replacement unit (2nd LR4) that I have now, I literally placed it on my level, flat, hardwood floor back in February of this year, and I haven't moved it until yesterday when the errors became intolerable. After my experience with my first LR4 unit that I received in the fall of 2022, I knew not to fall prey to hopeful, wishful thinking that the LR4 will just magically start to work properly. This time, I only tolerate ONE cat-shit-outside-the-LR4-on-the-floor-mat, not multiple cat shits on the floor and cat pees on my living room couch like I did over the 2022-2023 winter season. No, f\*\*\* that. I took it into my garage and spent about 6 hours cleaning and troubleshooting, to no success. My LR4 gets stuck at the exact same spot mid-cycle, and there is no way to continue or cancel the cycle using any combination of button-pushes and power-cycles. Once it gets to this one spot mid-cycle, the only way for me to get it back to the home position is to take the bonnet off and manually rotate the globe with my hands.

I don't understand how this company could be so irresponsible and careless. I'm about to receive my third LR4 unit. Third! Whisker must be losing money from this LR4 product... and if they're not, then that thing must be sooooo overpriced that the cost to produce must be close to $50, and the remaining $650 goes to funding all the customer support, tech support, shipping and handling, replacement units, etc.

Why the f\*\*\* didn't this company perform thorough product testing and R&D before releasing this product? And, if they did, and they knew this product was faulty when they released it, then why did they go ahead with the release? Why would the CEO decide to release a bad product and upset a large subset of Whisker's customers?

&#x200B;

My advice to any new LR4 owners is as follows: **do not tolerate the solid-red-lights cycle interruptions.** If your cat(s) is(are) anything like mine, then they probably don't poke their head into the unit while the damn thing is rotating. Most cats, I think, won't do that, because they're literally scaredy-cats. Especially do NOT tolerate solid-red-light cycle interruptions that are difficult or impossible to clear by some combination of button-presses and/or power-cycling the unit. You can try cleaning it, but if you've owned it for at least 1 or 2 months and you start to get these cycle interruptions then it's probably not because of dirt and debris (unless yours is really, really dirty). Do **not** hope and pray that these faults go away. Just pick up the LR4, bring it into your garage or some place where you can troubleshoot it, put out an ol'fashioned litter box for your cat(s), and try to get your damned LR4 to work PROPERLY and CONSISTENTLY. Try to get it to consistently cycle without any interruptions, and don't put it back to use until you are satisfied! Otherwise, you'll probably come home to a pile of cat crap and/or piss because your LR4 got stuck mid-cycle and your cat(s) had nowhere to go #2.

We paid $700 for a big hunk of plastic, a motor, some sensors, and some circuitry. We paid $700 for a product that WORKS, not one that will unexpectedly stop working while you're at work so your cat will ruin your $2000 couch!! We deserve more than that for $700.

Let's say you would otherwise spend 3 minutes, every day, scooping cat litter. After 90 days (the approximately lifetime of these LR4 units, in my experience), that cumulative time is 4.5 hours. Given the $700 that you paid to not have to do all the scooping, that's an hourly rate of $155 per hour."
"At my wits endNo matter what I do, my Litter Robot 4 keeps saying its waste bag is full whenever it is actually like 30% full. It's remarkably consistent in that. I'm sick of going through  a bag every 2 days. What can I do?"
"Sherman pees in the very back- how bad is this?Hey, first full week of the LR3. I keep it off. He‚Äôs pottying consistently in it. I turn it on when I‚Äôm home from work, maybe 1-2x/day to enjoy benefit. Anyway, noticing his pee pattern , as per his normal, is high up in the back. I‚Äôm reading up on LR, thanks to you all. Long-term, will his lifetime pee pattern lead to an inoperable LR? I try to reshape his litter and push it higher and wipe the rubber to simply clean it. Appreciate your input!"
"Can't believe I need a Litter Robot support group but here I am. I have a LR 3 connect. Does anyone have any tips to get a cat to use it. No litter box problems until now. One cat I can't keep out of it, another does his business and gets out and my female won't use it at all."
Cat terrified of robotJust had my LR4 for over two weeks now. I finally after a lot of coaxing and treats convinced both cats to use the bot. Since they were both using it consistently I decided to try and leave it turned on to cycle (my mistake‚Ä¶) and now one of my cats is terrified of the robot and protest pooped/peed on the floor this morning. Am I screwed? I turned it back off but I‚Äôm unsure of what to do at this point. I still have a traditional litter box next to the LR4.
"My experience/review with Pretty Litter and LR4I bought the LR4 around 4 months ago. Before that I have been using Pretty Litter with my cat for the last 4 years, primarily because the odor control was much better than any other litter I‚Äôve tried. Before buying the Litter Robot I searched for people‚Äôs experiences/reviews using Pretty Litter with it and I only found a few posts and some mixed reviews, so I thought now that I‚Äôve been using it for a while I‚Äôd share my experience here in hopes it might help other people. 

First of all: Does it work? Yes! At least for me, it works almost perfectly. One bag of pretty litter fills up just about right to the fill line. Also, since I used to use a bigger litter box with 2 bags per month, now that I only use one bag per month I‚Äôm even saving money. The only slight weirdness to keep in mind is the ‚Äúlitter level‚Äù reading on the app won‚Äôt work, it will always think the litter is low since it is based on weight and the Pretty Litter weighs a lot less than normal clay clumping litter. 

With the litter robot I find that the pretty litter in fact lasts even longer than it did before when I was scooping it manually, because when it spins some of the litter that is covered in pee drops down along with the poop, even though it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúactually‚Äù clump. This also has a bonus effect that you can still use the health monitoring feature of the litter by just opening the drawer when you get a notification that the clean cycle has finished and you will likely see the colored crystals. In the normal litter box a lot of the time by the time I scooped, the color would have mostly faded unless I scooped pretty soon after my cat happened to pee. 

Also, the odor control has been excellent in my experience. I read some reviews on here which said the Pretty Litter caused the litter robot to smell really bad, which honestly I haven‚Äôt had any experience even close to that. The few times I tried other litters before (several different ‚Äúodor blocking‚Äù clay litters, also pine and corn) they all smelled significantly worse. 

Another plus is that since not as much litter gets wasted forming pee clumps, the waste drawer fills up very slowly and the litter doesn‚Äôt significantly deplete to a level where I have to add more. I only have to empty the drawer around once a month which also matches with the same frequency I switch out the litter to a new pretty litter bag which works well since I can just push the ‚Äúempty‚Äù button and remove the waste from the month along with the emptied litter. Since the waste is still covered with crystals, it doesn‚Äôt actually smell bad, at least with just my one cat using it. Wiping down the globe is also usually pretty easy, unless you waited too long to switch the litter and pee started to stick to the side (the litter does kind of lose its absorbing power at about the 5-6 week mark in my experience with one cat) although you can just mix it around some with a scoop before emptying to mitigate that issue. 

My cat learned to use the robot pretty quickly, and even keeps sticking his head in there while it‚Äôs cycling which causes it to pause and continue later but it hasn‚Äôt had errors for that reason so far. I did have one sensor fault which I had to restart the robot, but I think that‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt wipe the sensors the first time I swapped out the litter so they accumulated some dust over the two months. 

Another negative it that it does track litter more than my old litter box which was a top entry where the cat had to jump in and out from above. And probably tracks more than heavier litter alternatives such as clay. 

Of course, my experience may not apply to everyone. I know for multiple cats pretty litter usually recommends multiple bags per month which obviously wouldn‚Äôt fit in the litter robot (though maybe you can also just switch it out more often?) I also believe the people with odor problems were telling the truth about their experience, though I can‚Äôt explain why their experience is so different from mine. Maybe different cats have different poop consistencies which don‚Äôt work as well with the non clumping litter. 

But if you find yourself annoyed by having to empty the waste bin a lot or the clay litter smelling bad and you don‚Äôt mind the additional cost of silica litter, I do think it could be worth a try. 

I hope this post is helpful to others who are currently happy with pretty litter and considering getting the litter robot, or vice versa if people are having problems with the clumping litter and want to explore an alternative."
"My cat waits for the LR4 to cycle then attacks the clumped pee out the LRMy 1st cat took to the LR4 immediately. My 2nd cat was terrified at first and completely refused to use the LR. After a while she finally got around to using it normally. She has been using it consistently for 4 months without fear of walking in or out of it. 
The problem is that she has grown a habit of waiting for the robot to cycle so that she can hiss and attack the clumps sometimes even grabbing the clumps out of the box and onto the floor. I am unsure of how to curb this aggressive behavior towards the LR? Anybody else had their cat behave this way?"
"Daily Cat Sensor Fault error makes the Litter Robot 4 uselessI'm really pissed off. We've had our unit for a few months and it constantly freezes mid-cycle with a ""Cat Sensor Fault"" error and a red light. It's so unreliable, we can't leave it alone with our kitties overnight for fear of this happening. Thus, we setup a regular litterbox as a back-up. I'm seeing this issue widely reported by other people as well. Shame on Whisker for allowing such an unreliable product out the door without the proper QA process in place! I had an LR3 for years. What a disappointment their new product is!

&#x200B;

Edit: Just want to provide an update to be fair to LR. The last firmware update fixed these issues. Our LR4 is now working consistently as expected. We can even leave for vacation now without worrying about the unit freezing. All is well! Thanks for fixing this LR! "
"Just got my LR4 - it works great!I just wanted to put a positive ‚Äúit works!‚Äù post here because before I got my litter robot, I read through many of the threads here and was very worried about whether it would work out or if I would regret it. 

I‚Äôm happy to report that both my cats used the litter robot within a few hours of me setting it up and have used it consistently for the past 4 days! They have not once returned to their old litter.

Also, the machine appears to be working great, set up was very easy and straightforward and I‚Äôve had no trouble with the sensor or the cycles being completed. The app is also great for controlling it (setting up sleep mode, minutes delay before cycling, etc.).

I use the Boxiecat pro litter (as suggested by several users on this sub) and it has worked great thus far- no residue left on the inside of the robot, no odors, great clumping, very little tracking.

All in all, I love my litter robot 4 (and my cats do too!) and I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase!"
"stuck on pause cycleAnyone have an issue where your litter robot 4 will pause during a cycle and get stuck there no matter what you try to do to fix it? Mine will be fine for a few days then get stuck and it always happens in the most inconvenientb imes like not being home and then our cat will poop in front of the litter robot because it can't go inside. 

Anyone have a fix for it?"
"LR4: 3 weeks in and very pleasedWanted to post our experience so far for anyone curious. 

TL;DR: Yes, we love it. So do the cats. Yes, even with some minor issues, I would still highly recommend it and I'd buy it again.

We bought the LR4 knowing full well the variety of issues many people were having. I did quite a bit of research on automatic litter boxes, and even with the issues people are having, LR was still the most consistently well rated of all of them. The LR4 would also be more comfortable for our long boy. He was the reason we were looking at this; he was peeing outside the 4 litter boxes we have (for 2 cats) once in a while, so we wanted to try this to see if it worked any better for him. Unfortunately for our wallets, he freaking loves it.

We made the purchase Dec 5 2022 and it arrived by Dec 28. Within 5 minutes of setting it up, both cats went inside (even after seeing it cycle for the first time upon plugin). They both used it within 10 minutes, and haven't touched any of the other litter boxes since (I know, we got super lucky). We have a 3-story townhouse, and I thought for sure they'd at least use the upstairs ones at night for convenience since they sleep with us upstairs, but they insist on walking all the way down to the basement to potty in their new automatic throne. They absolutely love it. And I love not having to clean out 4 litter boxes. 

Overall, we haven't had any major issues. However, what we have experienced:

* occasional ""cat sensor fault"" errors. This only ever happens after I refill the litter, and after I wipe out the sensors with a microfiber cloth, the error goes away. I've taken to refilling the litter, letting the dust settle for a minute or two, and then wiping. So far since I adjusted to that pattern, I haven't seen the cat sensor fault error. (Thanks to various posts in this sub for the wiping out the sensors tip.) This seems like it can't be avoided; you can't control dust. I don't mind wiping out the sensors because it's super easy.
* The liner got small rips in it in 6 days. Contacting support via website chat was super easy, and they promised to send out a replacement globe liner. It took about a week and half, but I finally got the shipped notification yesterday. Luckily we can still use ours with the small rips, but if it were anything major that meant we couldn't use the LR until the replacement arrived, I'd be disappointed in the shipping time. 

Other info if useful:

* **Cat litter**: Dr Elsey's Ultra Unscented Clumping Clay litter
   * We also keep the litter in a bin next to the LR with a 2 cup scoop inside. This makes refilling super easy (also a tip from this sub). We buy the litter in 40 lb bags, so it's really nice being able to scoop it into the LR instead of awkwardly dumping a heavy bag. 
   * I have asthma and this is the lowest dust option I have been able to find.
   * Tracking: it happens. it's a little maddening, ngl. But for now we're just vacuuming the area regularly and putting down various litter mats. 
* **Waste drawer**: 
   * Liners: The ones LR provides are sturdy and they work. However, they don't have draw strings so tying them off is a little tedious (for me and my preferences). I ended up getting these [eco liners from Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8WR8RFH). They're specifically designed for the LR4 drawer (they have LR3 ones as well), they have draw strings which makes emptying it SUPER fast and easy, and I don't feel awful about putting so much plastic out into the environment.
   * Emptying: With 2 cats, we empty the drawer once every 3-4 days since this is the only LR we have and they refuse to use any of the other ""basic"" boxes we have around the house. Again, with the draw string eco liners, it's easy and I don't feel bad about how much plastic we're going through. 
* **Weight sensor**: Ours is pretty accurate. We have it on vinyl flooring with no pads or anything under the LR. It weighed the boy at 12.3 one morning, I took him to the vet a few hours later for a checkup, and they weighed him at 12.3 as well. The LR scale can vary by a few ounces (sometimes the boy will be 12.3 and sometimes 11.7, but it doesn't switch back and forth between them, so it could be time of day, if he's had water or food, etc.) but I don't need to know exact weights. Just keeping an eye on their general weight is good enough for my use case. 

Again, overall super happy with this and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Hope this post is useful to others trying to decide."
"One of my kittens is far too interested in the cleaning cycle.Now, we‚Äôve only had the Litter-Robot 4 for just over a week. Both cats took to it fairly quick. The cat in question took to it instantly. They are both about 4.5months old. One is more adventurous than the other but as soon as a cycle starts no matter where they are in the house they run for the robot. 

My app history is full of cycle interruptions I‚Äôve watched it in person to see it too. I‚Äôve even picked up the kitten or moved her away just to see how much she needs to watch this. 

Each time she interrupts it she goes in, trills and pads around inside, paws at the bits here and there, jumps out, and jumps back in, rinse and repeat. Often she will jump out and wait for the cycle to resume, then jump back in. Once she got in while the waste bin portion was open to air. I don‚Äôt know if it concerns her that there is (I presume) so much odour. She seems to try covering it by pawing on the plastic walls but also steps down into the waste bucket üò≥üôÑ

As for things I‚Äôve tried:

- Leaving sleep mode on  24/7 - trigger manual cycles through the day. What‚Äôs the point? It changes nothing but frequency of the cycle but not the behaviour.

- Set maximum delay before a cycle starts. This has probably been the best thing, plus sleep mode through the night. The idea is that it becomes more about using the litter than the cycle. But not to the point it becomes a manual cycling affair. 

Not sure if the kitty is just curious, I assume so, or disturbed by the fact that her scent keeps getting removed. I once watched her (not ‚Äúwatch watch‚Äù), go pee, get out, wait and interrupt the cycle (short delay at that point), then poop at the point just before the litter vanishes behind the grate, then get out and keep interrupting the cycle‚Ä¶when it finally completed after about 20min she went back in, and as if by magic pooped again as soon as it was done. She seemed ‚Äúquite concerned‚Äù when sniffing around when it was clean, so who knows‚Ä¶maybe she wanted to scent it up. I don‚Äôt mean to humanize her motives but I‚Äôm trying for some sort of rationale. Maybe she was actually doing me a favour and being patient before pooping? I have no idea what goes through a cat brain. 

Finally, when trying to keep her out during a cycle using my foot or picking her up, it‚Äôs almost like trying to keep an adult cat from catnip. It borders on a bit crazy trying again and again to get back in. I won‚Äôt be doing that again, I was just trying to see how much this was curiosity or need vs something else. She was pretty worked up trying everything to sneak back in. I don‚Äôt want to do anything to dissuade her from using it and trying to stop her from interrupting it is obviously pointless, she couldn‚Äôt separate the two concepts I‚Äôm sure, so I‚Äôll let her do her thing.

So I give up. She is using it right, at least initially, I have the longest delay set in hopes they might be too occupied to bother with it. My concern is she will start to trigger cycles and do her business mid cycle or get her paws into the waste bin consistently, I don‚Äôt want it to be come part of her routine. 

Anyone have a cat who was like this but settled down? Her sister is sane, on this issue at least üòÇ

So should I stay with the king delay cycle? Or set it as short as possible so it keeps triggering a cycle in hopes she bores of it?"
"How long to keep trying?I‚Äôve had my robot set up for a week and neither of my boys are using it :(

I‚Äôve bought the ramp, sprayed catnip spray and left treats, added in litter from one of their old boxes, put the robot in the same spot as their old boxes, and I even bought dr.elseys litter additive and added it in the box. Nothing has worked.

I originally had 2 regular boxes for them. I took the larger one away so right now I have the bot and a small classic litter box next to each other. They are opting to use the small box. I even let it get very dirty (which I hated üò©) and they still made it work and got a little pee on the floor. I cracked last night and cleaned it because I feel bad making my kitties use a dirty box. 

A big part of me wants to remove it altogether but then I feel bad like I‚Äôm giving them anxiety and in their minds, nowhere to go potty. I think they‚Äôd go on the floor if I took it away and I don‚Äôt want to stress them out.

My boys are a bit older, 7 & 10. I‚Äôm at a loss on what to do now barring extremes. They aren‚Äôt scared of the box. They don‚Äôt run from it and will rub their faces on it, but will NOT go inside. I need to figure out how long to try this out before returning it ü•≤"
Stubborn Cat Finally Using LR4We have had the litter robot for about a month now and we're struggling getting one of our cats to use it. She finally started to use it consistently after we made a small  platform around the level of the step for her to jump on to get into the litter robot. Hopefully this helps anyone else with a stubborn cat.
"LR4 Completely Broke after 2 WeeksIs anyone else having this issue or have solutions for it? I am beyond frustrated with my purchase of the LR4. Not only did it take 6 extra weeks to arrive after I was told with the pre-order that it would be here in July, but it only ""worked"" for about two weeks. While it worked it was great, but that was very short lived. After those two weeks I have been faced constantly with the solid red bar and notifications such as ""cat sensor fault"" ""cycle interrupted"" ""cycle paused"" and there is nothing blocking the sensors, no cat in the litter box, nothing. I have tried calling the company, their phones are shut down due to high volume of calls, I have tried emailing the company only to not get a response, I have tried the chat function that is pushed so hard, and it never works, I have even tried contacting them on Instagram to be met only with automated responses, now I‚Äôm trying Reddit, maybe I‚Äôll have better luck? I have done everything possible listed under troubleshooting for the LR4: cleaning the sensors, emptying the entire thing, resetting the system by pushing down the reset and connect until it turns off then wait two minutes then turn back on, removing the globe to empty and clean it, I have tried everything. Nothing works. It may ""fix"" the issue for 30 seconds, only for it to start cycling and then proceed to have a cat sensor failure and then stops completely while the globe is all the way upside down. For obvious reasons, my cats can't use the litter box when the litter is covered and it is stuck ""emptying"" and I'm getting tired of my hardwood floors getting ruined because they are going to the bathroom outside of the litter box because it consistently doesn't work. I am very upset, frustrated, disappointed in the fact that I spent so much money on what came highly recommended to me, only to be met with so many problems and no solutions. I'm not sure what else to do since I am not receiving communication back in any capacity. The entire thing doesn‚Äôt work anymore whatsoever. üòï"
"Litter Robot 4 stops mid-cycle and won't restartI have a 4 and am having a consistent issue with the cycle stopping mid-way but not finishing.

About 3x a week, I will come into the room and the robot will be stopped mid-cycle, at the point where the hole is lined up with the tray, and a solid red light.  My first thought is that, of course, one of the cats has messed with it and it's on pause.

Except it doesn't kick back on after 7 minutes and finishes the cycle.

This morning I walked in to it mid-cycle and stopped with a solid red light.  I checked the app and it had been more than 7 minutes--by quite a bit--.  I did the following: Did a ""start cycle"" on the app (no response).  Did a ""start cycle"" with the buttons on top of the robot (no response).  Turned the robot off and on again (cycled thru the lights and stopped on solid red again).  Completely unplugged the robot and plugged it back in (that time it did start to do the cycle then immediately stopped).  Lifted and swept under the robot, then tried to ""start cycle"" again.  Nothing.  There is nothing in the way, there is nothing poopy hanging around, the liner has ""popped"", nothing looks different from any other time it's been used.  The tray is not full nor is anything blocking the opening.

The problem here is twofold: I leave for work in 15 minutes and the litter box is unusable.  So how does that work exactly?  And of course #2 (LOL) is that I paid a lot of money for a litter box, not to be spending too much time trying to get it to function.  For $800 it should almost wipe my cat's butt for me, not me spending the morning trying to reset it so that the cats can use it at all.

Did I get a lemon?"
"Caution! No Support From the CompanyUpdate 10/24/2022: Received satisfactory service from the company. Case closed.

I bought a Litter Robot 3 on in December 2019, along with a 3-year warranty. A couple of months ago my litter robot developed a problem ‚Äì it consistently got stuck halfway while cycling.

When it is stuck, I can solve it by pressing the ‚Äúoff‚Äù and ‚Äúon‚Äù buttons, unplugging the power, or moving the robot a bit; then it will continue to cycle through. But now it is getting worse ‚Äì it is stuck 2-3 times during 1 cycle, so now it becomes burdensome.

Before I post my experience on other social media, I am going to wait a few days to see if they will contact me. If not, trust me I am going to post my complaint everywhere online until I hear back from the company.

Honestly, I am very happy with my robot. I was considering buying a Litter Robot 4 for my 2nd floor. But this really ruined my experience, especially since I purchased a warranty with it.

New buyers be aware"
"Cat LitterI've been using my L3 for over a year now, using World's Best Litter. I kept getting a ""Dump Position Fault"" error message, blue-yellow-red lights flashing. I took it apart and cleaned it multiple times, and the message kept popping up.

They have subsequently sent me a new base.

I am now wondering if this is attributable to the litter over time? I don't love how it tracks/dusts, but I feel better about my cats grooming themselves with a natural product. And it's been my chosen litter for years. 

Last Thanksgiving my young cat was drooling and lethargic, I think that may have been from her ingesting regular litter (I was waiting for my WB order to get delivered). Those symptoms seem consistent with cats ingesting regular clumping clay litter- as of my findings from Dr. Google.

WB is expensive, and I'm nervous to have another drooling lethargy kitty session."
"Does LR4 pet weight function work with multiple cats?I have two cats, not sure if what I am reading on the app is accurate."
"LR4 issues with scale and nightlightI just received my new LR4 yesterday, and I'm mostly thrilled. My cat started using it almost immediately with no encouragement, and it performs its main function of cleaning the litter flawlessly. So far, so good! However, there are two annoying issues that I can't solve:

1. The SmartScale in the app always shows 0.0 lbs. I've tried updating the firmware, power-cycling the unit, and pressing the reset button multiple times. I've seen in another post that the scale doesn't work great on carpet, and yes, my unit is on carpet. I will buy an 18"" circle of wood from Home Depot as suggested. But if that's really the issue, shouldn't it show SOME weight rather than 0? It always shows ""Cat Detected"" in the app history when my cat enters, and it always initiates a cleaning cycle 5 minutes after he exits, so it's definitely detecting a weight change. So why does it consistently show 0.0 lbs? Seems like there's something other than the carpet issue here.

2. I can't get the nightlight to turn on, no matter what I do. I've tried both Auto and On settings in the app, and all three brightness settings (Low, Medium, High) ‚Äî no dice. Am I doing something wrong, or did I receive a bad unit?

Thanks for any insight!"
"can you get alerts for when the cat sensor goes off? NOT for cycling complete, I need to see the poo :)I have a lr3 and I never updated to the new app so mayyybe it's an option in there but I would like to get a notification when my cat uses the box and before it dumps it so I can check her poop. She's having diarrhea but I think it's a red herring and she's actually constipated, but I need to see how much is there and consistency and you guys know how it is! I have a camera set up but it sends me notifications every time the sun moves and makes different shadows. Any hacks using Google home or anything like that? Thanks for any info!"
"Bonnet Removed is the stupidest alertI‚Äôve been having trouble with this alert ever since I received my LR3 4 years ago. It‚Äôs not consistently going off, but there will be spells of it happening multiple times a week. Customer service says to pull the tabs of the bonnet out so they are making contact blah blah blah

Why even make this a problem that stop the cycling of the litter robot. The dome could probably still cycle even if one of the tabs wasn‚Äôt in the slot correctly. Now my cats have pooped on the floor. Fantastic. I‚Äôm about remove this whole Litter Robot. 

Has anyone gotten this alert to permanently go away?"
"Ways to get around having to shake the tray every other day?My LR3 connect will say it‚Äôs full after about 15 cycles. Pull out the tray and it is just a pyramid of waste, so if you shake it then it will run another 10 cycles. Shake it again and get another 7-10. There has got to be a better way than this? We consistently get 35-50 cycles before having to change the bag, but we have to shake it starting at about 15. 

Ideas?"
"Tray Full - How often?Ours is filling about every 2 days with 2 cats. Do I need to shake the tray to level or something else? Or does that seem consistent?

They have another litter box available, but they never use it."
"Help, cats decided they don't want to use litter robot anymoreHi everyone, I'm in need of some tips or advice. 

I've had the litter robot connect for about 2 years now. My cats never had much of an issue with starting to use it and have been consistent with it since the switch. 

I haven't changed the litter or any environment changes but now all of a sudden they have decided to not pee in it anymore. Resulting in them peeing on carpet outside of it (I also have it in the litter robot hutch) 

I have done everything I can think of to fix/prevent the outside peeing since then but nothing seems to stick. I have borrow a friend's high end vacuum carpet washer, I have used enzyme eliminators and litter attract in the box

Does anyone have any suggestions at all on how to potentially fix this problem or anything, itd be greatly appreciated"
"I like the Litter-Robot....but their customer service..yikesDoes Litter robot have a customer service phone number? No one is replying to my ticket and chat agent is always offline. It's been a few days now  


I'm leaving for a week and I need some resolution :( (my brand new litter robot no longer works)"
"Newly adopted stray instant fan of Litter Robot!3 days ago, I officially adopted the beautiful stray 7 month old domestic tabby who's been visiting me for a month. No microchip, had her bloodwork (clear!) and first vaccines done, scheduled for surgery and microchipping in 3 days.

I've never taken in a stray cat before, but given the horror stories I've heard about toilet training puppies, I fully accepted I would be cleaning up some messes until she understood what the patch of ground up corn and cassava is for. The Internet explains cats will instinctively go to the litter box because of their need to bury their waste in soil, but having no experience and not knowing the last time this young cat was around a litter box, I did not let myself assume it would be that easy. I have a litter robot for our resident cat, but it took her FOREVER to start using it. Treats, catnip, silvervine, smelly unscooped old litter box, nothing worked. She now uses it consistently, never gone anywhere outside of it even after we took away the old litter box, but I'm guessing she would have stuck with the old set-up if given the option (look on the bright side, sweetheart: now you have a clean bathroom every time you need to go, even when I'm not home!). I expected Juliet (my new furbaby) would take even longer to adjust to it, so I got a foldable travel litter box for her base camp and for her to use until she got comfortable with the litter robot.

One thing that worried me was, after peeing in her carrier on the way home from the vet, she didn't pass any urine or feces for over 24 hours. Didn't use the travel litter box, didn't go anywhere in her room, either. The vet said, since there were no signs in the bloodwork or kidney dysfunction and no signs of a blocked bladder at her exam, that it was likely just from stress, that it's common for animals to do this in a new home (her dog whom she got a month ago did the same), and to keep waiting.

That day (yesterday), we had a heatwave so bad that I had to move Juliet out of the storage room I set up as her base camp into my room because it has an air conditioner (resident cat Cali is free to roam everywhere else, including the 1st floor and basement where it's cooler). This also happens to be where the litter robot is. So I move her, set the AC at 80, go back to work, come home, check the litter robot log on a whim... and see it was set off and cycled 4 hours after the move! She never used the litter box, never used the carpet or anywhere else, but left alone in a room with a litter robot, that's where she went! I didn't show it to her or put her near it or anything! I never expected she'd be down for that so soon, but she used it of her own accord.

Since base camp swapping is part of cat introduction, Juliet is comfortable in my room, and Cali has no problem with using the travel litter box, I left Juliet in my room the rest of the day, and she used the litter robot again late that evening.

I'm so relieved she's okay and so glad the litter robot has her seal of approval!¬†She can't have seen one before -- anyone who cared enough about a cat to buy her a $500 gadget would have had her spayed and vaccinated -- but she's an instant fan.

Good job, guys!"
"LR isn‚Äôt recognizing my catsI have two cats that are both around 9 lbs. They both love the LR. However, even after doing more than one reset, the LR still isn‚Äôt detecting their weight consistently. I‚Äôve had to manually cycle the machine multiple times. Any tips?"
"Quality control and customer service has gone down the toilet.Just thought I‚Äôd share my recent experience with autopets and their litter robot 3 connect. 

I have had a LR3 non-connect for about 4 years and have had to hack the thing apart to make it work consistently. First the cat sensor went bad, then pinch sensor faults, then dump position. This was bought from RobotShop refurb and has worked since repairs/deletes were made.

I decided that wifi connectivity would be great because I am getting busier, and I‚Äôd like to know if the globe gets stuck upside down or something. Ordered one with extended warranty.

The day it arrived I immediately had a dump position fault. 2 hours of ‚Äútroubleshooting‚Äù later and.. New base was on the way. This troubleshooting consisted of sending photos of the unit, cycling like 40 times, and reconnecting the power supply. The person on the phone had no idea what a hall-effect sensor was, which is the likely culprit for this issue. Red flag, old tech support knew these robots inside and out 2-3 years ago. What the hell happened?

New base shows up, same dump fault issue. The new globe works fine on my old white LR3 non connect unit, so the globe is fine. The issue is with the base. 

I asked the tech support person if these robots are at least tested with weight in them before leaving the warehouse.. She couldn‚Äôt answer, but offered me ‚Äúwhite glove service‚Äù for a brand new unit.. This means that the new unit will have been tested for 3-4 hours before sending it out.

This was essentially an indirect answer to my question. Testing new units is a luxury service, doesn‚Äôt sound like they have any sort of quality control system in place to prevent these things from happening.

I totally understand that supply chains are messed up and things are getting more expensive.. But at this point I would be okay with paying significantly more for a well designed robot that actually works, and goes through quality control testing before shipping out. Why is this not standard? How hard is it to throw some granular no dust substance into the robot to simulate cycling litter? Just a single cycle and then empty.. Takes 5 freaking minutes people. 

The tolerances/fitment on the new LR3 connect unit is downright abysmal too. The globe just drags against the base/bonnet because it was molded in an oval shape, old unit is perfectly round. New unit is significantly out of round. 

All in all, buyer beware. You have a very high chance of being sent a steaming pile of trash, and may end up like me. The person with 3 fucking litter robots sitting in his office with a 4th on the way. 

It‚Äôs pathetic, and I really hope another business steps up to the plate to make something better. Because this isn‚Äôt it.

"PETKIT got their 'next generation' when will LR4 be out?Did some research on automatic litterboxes and these two seem to be the go-to while I prefer the LR3 because it feels more consistent according to reviews. However, it has really been a while since it was released so wanna ask if LR4 be anywhere insight to improve the machine?"
Has anyone else had this problem?So my cats are light enough to not consistently set off the weight sensor but heavy (and strange) enough that they will jump into the litter robot during a cycle and set off an over torqe fault because the litter robot thinks it's full. Has anyone found a way to stop cats from jumping in mid cycle?
"Sticking pee clumpsJust got our connect 3 and already noticing a consistent spot where our cats pee. Near the front right where the  ""litter full"" line. I have the timer set to 15min and the clump is still sticking to the silicone/rubber liner. 
Using Purina 24/7 lightweight litter.

Also, the night light stays on all the time even when the area the connect 3 is in is lit. 

Anything I can do to apply to the liner so nothing sticks? Is that recommended?"
"Getting your Cat Acclimated 

In most cases, cats will quickly adapt to a new litter box. If your cat is having a hard time adjusting to the Litter-Robot, we have included some tips and tricks that have worked for our customers in the past. You can also try googling tips.

1. When starting out with the Litter-Robot, leave the base unit turned OFF. It is best to wait until you see evidence of consistent use before turning the base unit ON to use the automatic cycling. If a clean cycle is required during the acclimation period, just run the cycle manually by turning the unit ON and then OFF again after the cycle has completed. Once you feel your cat is comfortable using the Litter-Robot, you can then resume the automatic mode (leaving the unit ON).

2. Keep the old litter box in the same room or next to the Litter-Robot and let it fill up. This will give your cat a choice between the clean Litter-Robot and a not-so-clean litter box.

3. Put some soiled litter into the Litter-Robot for a familiar scent.

4. Use Cat Attract additive. There is a brand of litter by Dr. Elsey‚Äôs called Cat Attract. There are also ‚Äúcat attract‚Äù products on the market that you sprinkle into your normal litter. You can find it by doing a search online.

5. Place treats on the ledge or around the Litter-Robot so that your cat associates rewards with the unit. One customer even placed treats in a dish inside the unit to get their cat to go inside and see that it is safe and has clean litter.

6. Sit down with your cat next to the unit. Comfort him and show him that the Litter-Robot is not to be feared. Customer Service Code: 5050

7. Another customer placed the globe on the floor and secured it so that it would not rotate. Having the globe at eye level helped the cat to feel more comfortable entering the globe.

\*\* If you've kept your old litter box, some of the litter boxes are big enough so the globe can be placed on it securely. We had a customer try this, her cat started using it, and continued to use it after she replaced the globe on the Litter-Robot base!

8. Since cats are curious and love to go into boxes, you might also try putting the original packaging box over the Litter-Robot with a hole cut out for the entry and the drawer.

9. Don't block the unit or create a place where the cat could feel ""trapped.""

Here is a video with some more information:

Is it worth it ?Highly considering this pricy option! My two 1.5 year old cats consistently poop outside if the litter box despite us keeping it clean ! We‚Äôve tried everything.
"LR3 Base Glider buttonsHow often do these need to be replaced? I assume they're made out of Teflon or a similar, low friction plastic.

Over time, do they become less smooth and add more friction and resistance to the motor when it tries to rotate the globe?

I've had a Litter Robot 3 for many years, but recently my motor sounds like it's straining to rotate the globe. As I consistently put the same amount and same type of litter in my LR3, I don't think the amount of or type of litter is the problem as it hasn't had this problem in the past.

Would replacing the Glider Buttons (which can be ordered from the Whiskers web site) most likely improve the mechanical rotation performance of my unit?"
"How I Taught My Skiddish Cat to Use LR3For those like me who tried everything and all the suggestions and nothing worked... This is how I transitioned my skiddish cat to the litter robot with complete success and ease (when I started doing it right).


First off I made big mistakes. But that's good because it means you can still reverse some behaviors! 

I made a split decision to order the litter robot because I needed to leave town and I felt bad having my friend deal with the boxes and thought it would be easier. I ignored the advice that the company gave with transitioning because I am dumb lol. 

So I'm gone for a week. I return. Our litter robot is near an office and the other boxes remained in the guest bathroom. 

I assume they're both using the bot due to timing intervals and clean, collapse the boxes and store them. 

I later found a piece of cat poo in front of the litter robot. Uh oh... Someone has not transitioned. This was confirmed when I found another poo a day later in front of the bot. Knowing my boys it was likely Leo. He's the younger more skiddish cat. 

So I implemented everything. I put the box next to the bot. I stopped cleaning the box. I got litter attractant. I fed treats and cat nip. I modified the shipping box. I purchased the stairs, I moved¬† the litter guard, kept it unplugged...All these suggestions from litter robot and online I did everything nothing was working!!!

So I turned to Jackson Galaxy's YouTube channel. Although he is not a fan of this type of litter box... He understands cat psychology very well. His advice has always worked for training my cats. So I visited his YouTube page and started to research.¬† Clearly I am doing something wrong... And I was.. I didn't realize that Leo was afraid of the Orb. He didn't like going into it. He must have attempted while I was out of town and it scared him because it was moving. So I screwed up. That AND... 

I didn't use the jackpot treat. Galaxy talks about what he calls the jackpot treat that is something so amazing the cats focus on you relentlessly. For my boys that is chicken. They go CRAZY for it. 

My mistake was the greenies treats I was using required the cat to put his head down and not look at me while he ate. Galaxy discusses how you should use very small bits of the jackpot treat because the cat will focus on you completely and they eat it so fast that they keep their attention on you.¬† More on this soon.. because there are other critical things to address first.. 

So what I did was this: 

First I need to see if he uses it or not. So I ordered a Eufy 2k Pan and tilt camera off of Amazon. It's a little over $50 but you don't have to do any monthly payments to record things like Wyze requires. I've been very impressed with Eufys quality and ease and I can always see if a pet walks by the litter robot because it'll send a message to my phone when a pet is detected (you have to manually turn on that feature in the settings).


Now for the litter robot: 

Keep it unplugged. Do not risk the bot moving terrifying the cat again. It has to be safe and happy. If you're using the stairs make sure they're secured otherwise if they shift it'll scare the cat. Make sure the orb is locked in with the big plastic key thing in the back so it doesn't shift and scare the cat!

This is so important that I'm going to say it again. You have to make everything happy and positive. It has to be amazing and wonderful and great. NOTHING can be scary. For example when you change the bag in the bot do NOT shake the bag hard to get it open or that will scare the cats and associate the bot with being scary so don't do it! Be calm, happy, and gentle always around the bot. 

Any time I had to move the litter robot or clean it I did not let the cats see it so they wouldn't get scared. I kept the cardboard box over the bot to hide the orb and make it less conspicuous 24/7 as described in the litter robot video. 

Next I moved the litter robot to the guest bathroom and put it next to his old box. I even kept the cardboard on the robot to hide the scary orb there as well. They've known this room as the poop room for a long while. Let's keep it the poop room. I even had to disassemble the bot to get it through the door but it was worth it! 

Every time I emptied the base of the litter robot I put that excrement in the old box. I made the old box less and less desirable. But Leo kept using it still I was absolutely blown away. 

So here comes the treats. I put Max (older cat) in another room with an activity ball full of treats. I sat down with Leo at the bot and would give him treats on the steps to let him know that it's ok and it's safe and it's positive. Then I would get the chicken out. What I did was air fry it, shred it into small pieces, let it cool, and put it in the bowl. 

For NO MORE than 10 minutes at a time (training with cats must be brief) I would place very small bits of chicken on the steps or the litter guard rim. This is the JACKPOT. This food they adore so much and don't get as often as I now realize they probably should.. is now associated with the scary litter robot. But is it scary? I mean the best treat is now here with the thing that sometimes turns! 

So after some time of doing this I would pet Leo and praise him and give him scratches on his favorite spots on his head. Then we were done. It is always important to leave the cat wanting more. Never make them full. Try to train before meals. If you leave them wanting more they'll be willing to do anything...

Doing this I noticed.. Leo is starting to go investigate the outside of the bot on his own. He's looking to see if there is anymore of that amazing chicken at the litter robot! So he definitely has now associated the bot with the happiest thing in his life. 

He still, however, wouldn't go in. 

So for the next few days we do this again with the chicken. I keep associating that the bot is safe and ok. I never pushed him in the bot because if I did that could ruin all of the progress. That method has worked for some people but it's way too risky. You need to make them choose to go in on their own. 

So I got a bowl that I didn't care about and I put a bunch of chicken in the bowl. I showed it to Leo so he knew immediately wow that's a LOT of jackpot! He will do ANYTHING to get it! 

So I held the chicken in the bowl and very slowly pushed my hand further and further into the orb. VERY SLOW. Like JUST out of reach for Leo to get. He would get close .. slow down .. contemplate the decision .. move slightly closer only if I was just in reach. If I moved too far he would back away. But as I slowly lead the bowl further back into the orb he finally put a paw over. We kept this up until his front 2 paws were in. Then I placed the bowl in the very very back. He finally plopped inside with all 4 paws on his own! So I picked up the bowl and moved it around him so he would turn around and face his head outside of the orb. I then held the bowl immediately outside of the orb for him to put only his head slightly out to eat plethora of amazing chicken! 

He stayed in on his own. He chowed down. I praised him with a high pitch happy voice and I scratched his head which he loves. When he finished the chicken he stopped and looked around the orb as if he realized hey this isn't so bad either that or I wonder if there's chicken in here (again he ate it with the bowl just outside the orb so he's not eating inside of it) He then looked around a bit more and exited the orb. I praised him more and cleaned stuff up and we called it a day. 


The next morning I decided to take a big step. I went into the poop room and closed the door so I could clean the robot without scaring Leo.. and I decided that since Leo has realized the inside of the orb is not so bad maybe he will give it a try today. So I collapsed and cleaned his old box and stored it away. I made sure my camera was set up. I cycled and again unplugged the robot. I put that giant cardboard back on.¬† I always made sure to keep it cleaned up before they ate so they'd be more tempted to use it however I also would sprinkle their old litter in there so they smell it and know. It also helped that one time Leo used the old box next to me so I put some of what I knew was his inside the robot. 

On top of that I moved the litter robot in the exact spot the manual box was so his habit of going to that location in the room would be maintained. 

So he eats breakfast. I'm exercising across the hall. And I turn and I see him climb right in, do his business, cover it up, and hop right out. I was amazed. My jaw dropped. I watched and rewatched it on my phone from the Eufy camera! He finally used the damn thing!

So then what I did was I slowly transitioned it to the room I wanted to use it in. Some suggest daily moving it closer and closer... Honestly I went faster than that. But again I monitored with the camera to make sure he's still using it. He was! 

Now it was time to remove the cardboard. This could be complete nonsense but I was determined to not let anything screw this progress up. After w few days of him consistently using the robot I made my next move.

I waited until the sun would set (Leo doesn't have great vision) and with the cats locked away I removed the cardboard box so I wouldn't scare them. Then hid the box away from sight so they wouldn't think it was there to use for relieving themselves just in case. I kept the lights dim and who knows if this helped but Leo was ok with big orb being visible. 

Finally it came time to train that the orb turning is ok. What I did first was I got the cats in a position near where the robot is but out of sight. I got chicken out and I fed it to them while I then turned the robot on to cycle. The treats should happen during the entire cycle process and even slightly before. Now when they heard that sound it becomes associated with something great! I didn't want to do this too frequently or for too long because I didn't want them to RUN in the room every time it cycled expecting chicken. 

So the next day we did this again but in the room with the bot. Progressively getting closer to the bot with giving small bits of chicken. I watched Leo as he would look at the orb and then eat some more chicken then he would look at the orb as it spun. He became curious rather than scared. I made sure to keep the chicken far enough from the orb so they never have a temptation to climb in during the cycle. Instead it was maybe closest on the stairs just to show Leo the machine is ok when spinning but it's just busy. Otherwise we would do these sessions somewhat in proximity. 

Next what I did was I plugged in the bot and kept it plugged in. But I would use the sleep feature that way it would only spin when I'm home. So I made it sleep when I left for work and sleep when I slept! Keep the timer to 15min! This helps the cat get away and maybe sit somewhere else when it finally cycles and allowed me to sometimes find out when it was going to cycle. 

The first time it spun while I was home I gave a mix of chicken and greenies. Again just in proximity sitting nearby the bot. I'm phasing the jackpot out because he is using it and not very afraid of it.¬† 

I used my Eufy camera to monitor the robot. I finally verified that Leo is on his own climbing into the bot and using it for relief, and now completely content with the cycling. 

Cats do things for a reason. Their language and culture is so different from us that it can be very easy for us to judge their behavior for the wrong reason. 

I really really hope this helps someone out there. I did NOT want to return this amazing product. It has made my life so much easier and I definitely hope it continues to do just that!

EDIT: FYI with the Eufy camera if you use a micro SD card you don't have to sign up for that optional payment cloud service. Just get a 128GB micro SD card and you're set.

EDIT2: OMG i spelled Skittish wrong so many times lol. Sorry about that."

"switching from old box to LRHello! I got my LR about a week ago and so far so good. One of my cats uses it exclusively but the other one still seems to prefer the old box. My question is, how long should I wait before throwing out the old box? The hesitant one has used it once or twice so he know thats he‚Äôs supposed to go in there. Should I wait until he‚Äôs using it more consistently or get rid of the box now since he knows where to go?"
"Cat refusing to use the Litter Robot. Worried I messed up the acclimation process.Hey!  


I have two cats; one of them uses the litter robot perfectly fine, whereas the other one (who is notoriously scared of everything) does not. I have had it for about a month now. During the acclimation process, I left it off, but the amount of times it was being used and the amount of waste in it made me think that both cats were consistently using it, so I turned it back on. This is where I am worried I messed up. Obviously, only one was using it, so now the other is scared of it. She was weird about changing to the Breeze system as well, but she eventually came around, so I am hoping it will happen eventually.  


So far, I've tried mixing in litter attractant as well as not scooping the old box at all. However, it is getting really hard to put up with the smell of the old box and I am constantly wanting to clean it. I've also moved some of the clumps from the old box to the Litter Robot to no avail. I tried using treats, but I am worried the other cat will just go for them. Please give me any additional tips; I really want this to work out."
One cat refusing to use LRI have had the LR for close to 2 months with 3 cats. 2 of them have used it from day one. The third one is on and off. She will randomly pee or poo directly outside of the box. I had to replace the rug in the room since she would keep going on it. She has had problems with other boxes in the past. I make sure there is already clean litter and I slowly introduced them to it. How can I get the stubborn cat to consistently use the LR?
"Feeder Robot experiences? Unsure about mine...I've been using the Feeder Robot for a couple weeks now. I'm trying to determine if I'm just using it wrong or if it's simply not what I'm looking for.

My cat can be a sensitive eater. I was hoping this could help me keep him on a better routine and monitor his eating habits. I can't leave food out for him, but my schedule only allows me to feed him twice a day, with breakfast being the only usually consistently timed one. He goes through phases of eating so quick he pukes or barely eating half a meal all day for days at a time, and maybe it's just in my head, but I feel like it gets worse when I get more unreliable about when he gets fed. It also seems like the food being stale or not plays a role, so I try to avoid leaving too much just sitting out.

I'm feeding him Wellness Core Indoor dry food with the 1/8 cup size dispenser and the hopper insert.

Is there any type of scale in the base that tells the gravity mode how much food is in the bowl? The couple times I've tried to use it, it dumped food out 4-6 times. Is that normal? That's not helpful for me since I'm wanting to feed him smaller amounts more frequently and trying to avoid wasting food or him gorging himself. I was hoping that feature would help actually conserve food by only replenishing the bowl if it was under a certain amount.

I haven't played around with the app much, but is there any way to see statistics besides just if food was dispensed or not? That's not really helpful, besides letting me know it's actually working, since it should dispense food when I have set it to. I would really love a way to track if and when my cat eats, even better if it could tell me how much was eaten!

Maybe I was just asking for too much! I probably should've done more research. üòÖ Is there some other smart feeder out there that does what I want? Am I just using this product wrong? Am I actually totally incorrect about my cats behavior, imagining how finicky he is, and stressing/feeling mom guilt for no reason? Was he fine without me dropping $250 on something else to make my house one step closer to being a real life Brave Little Toaster?

Any advice or experience sharing welcome! He's my first and only cat, so I would love the wisdom of more experienced cat parents haha"
"Using Google wifi router; can't connect app to litter robotI've been struggling to connect the app to the litter robot.  I get to the very last step of 'wifi confirmed' and then time out.

I've tried both the litter robot app and the autopets app, have tried restarting both the litter robot and the apps.  My wifi password consists of only 10 letters.  

I did notice that the troubleshooting sites say that I need to use 2.4ghz, but google wifi is supposed to be dual-band.  Is this maybe causing problems / how do I get it to connect?"
"Helpful tips for you and your cat in transitioning from a litter box to the Litter-Robot&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uk6vw5mmz2j11.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08124c5d7157b91aa0eacc32b262d39689f54711

Most cats adapt pretty quickly to the Litter-Robot.  However, if you and your cat are having difficulties making the switch, here are some ways to help facilitate the transition:

1. **LOCATION IS KEY**

Place the Litter-Robot next to your old litter box to give them time to explore and familiarize themselves. Place litter in the unit but leave it unplugged for now.

**2.** **ENTICE**

After a few days, if your cat is not showing interest in the Litter-Robot, try enticing them by placing some catnip or a favorite treat on or near the unit.

3. **FAMILIAR SCENTS**

Add a scoop of litter from the old litter box to the Litter-Robot to provide a familiar scent for your cat.

4. **INTRODUCE THE CLEAN CYCLE**

Once you see proof that your cats are using the Litter-Robot, plug it in and cycle the unit. Make sure your cats are present when you power the Litter-Robot on and cycle it for the first time. While they observe the motion and become familiar with the sound of the Litter-Robot, you can be there to reassure them. Turn the unit off again once the cycle is complete.

5. **MAKE THE OLD LITTER BOX LESS ATTRACTIVE**

Stop cleaning the old litter box. Cats prefer a clean litter box and a dirty litter box might will promote the use of the clean Litter-Robot.

6. **SAY GOODBYE TO SCOOPING**

Once your cats are consistently using the Litter-Robot, turn the unit on and remove the old litter box."
"I‚Äôm sorry but I need to rant about one thing in particular.In future updates can we make it so that when I, the human operator of this device, press a button- the machine does what I‚Äôm telling it to do?? I feel like I‚Äôm pushing elevator ‚Äòclose door‚Äô buttons here.

I assume it‚Äôs triggered or in a panic lockdown over a speck of dust that floated in front of a sensor, maybe the signal light is red (I don‚Äôt know cause the sun is up and I literally can‚Äôt see the light *at all*) but the damn thing just ignores me 9.999 times out of 10. 

Please devs, let me be the boss of this machine. I appreciate the need for caution but If I say to dump the litter- dump the litter. If my cat lays a nasty duke and I smell it from my couch, and I say to cycle immediately or to continue cycling despite an interruption- DO IT!! 

I am capable of assessing the presence of my cat. I do not care if my hand tripped a sensor or if the light is red and we‚Äôre in a delay period- if I want to override for any purpose, I should be able to! Please please!

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
"Review - Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount - 2 Months of Use**Introduction: Whisker Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount**

The Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is an innovative accessory designed to enhance the functionality of the Litter Robot 4 by allowing users to monitor their pet's activity more closely.

I‚Äôve been using the new Whisker camera mount for about 2 months, and in this product review, we will evaluate the camera mount's features, focusing on its ease of installation, compatibility concerns, and any potential improvements.

https://preview.redd.it/30fm1qy0fl1b1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=907690c65b697907406400f2d0c16a1c3a8a7d87

https://preview.redd.it/fiffrmzbcl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04b1e86755b67f9f78c1afd2ebd21c2fad9734b2

https://preview.redd.it/fy1jpdvccl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b98ad408a2830e15edf1203b7b122b6cc03e92c

**Ease of Installation: A Major Plus**

One of the highlights of the Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is its user-friendly installation process. The mount is designed with a snap-in mechanism similar to the included fence of the Litter Robot 4, which ensures a secure fit without requiring additional tools or equipment.

It has a cover to hide any exposed wires from being played with or chewed at by your furry friend.

The original mount that came with the camera would trip the light sensors on the Litter Robot 4; causing it to not turn on the night light automatically in the dark.

(Likely due to picking up the infrared light from the cameras night vision as found below).

https://preview.redd.it/ctkh5predl1b1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f7f8c27ab4a2273374864c31ef2f1b9e9deae04

However the new camera mount accessory resolves these issues; I am able to position the camera in more positions to find one without causing a ""light bleed"" issue.

This is great since I can have the camera night vision on, as well as litter robot 4 automatic night light.

**Camera Compatibility: Just Double check!**

The Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is currently designed to work with cameras featuring magnetic mounts or tripod mounts.

However, it does not include any clip-ins or ball joint attachments for cameras that utilize those types of mounting methods, my Eufy Indoor C24 camera I use which actually utilize both these methods so I was mostly out of luck. (So, I thought?)

I could have used the magnetic attachment; the Eufy does have a metal bracket on the bottom for this, but it didn‚Äôt feel as secure as I would have liked. I knew the cats would easily pull it down due to the weight of the camera.

https://preview.redd.it/ydx9aedecl1b1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbce97e04c9ee91771b898896c9ef20dc596adfb

(Camera mounting clips in red below for reference)

**Solution!** After about 30 minutes, I managed to get the camera installed securely without the magnet by taking it apart further than a regular user might be comfortable doing as found below:

https://preview.redd.it/ydugzolfcl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3baeb6e747a0f42aebe0852b27401c715df4fba8

**Summary of steps include:**

&#x200B;

1. Remove the SD card, if you have one installed. This is important! If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll damage the      camera.
2. Open the case. There‚Äôs a small recessed area at the bottom of the camera between the black camera face and the white base. Pry gently with a screwdriver or a sludger.
3. Once you have the front part open, carefully remove the braided red and black speaker wire from the camera board.
4. Unscrew the stand from the case. It‚Äôs secured by one small screw. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be left      with; my case I decided to paint the stand black while I was here, but usually it would be white.

Once I had access to the ball joint, I removed it from the stand and fed it through the hole on the new LT4 mount, and then screwed it back into the camera assembly, giving it a tight fit to the mount without any play.

https://preview.redd.it/kfz9afmjcl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dad8600034270cf3316e3065730a84c02479457f

To accommodate a wider variety of cameras and consumer preferences, the recommendation for Whisker should be to consider possibility including more camera attachments for the mount.

However I realize they need more user feedback as they can‚Äôt possibly test all the cameras on the market. The current solution using magnets and the standard for tripod camera mounts is a great start.

**Designated Camera Angles: Perfect**

The Litter Robot 4 camera mount provides a set number of designated camera angles, enabling users to monitor their pet's activity during the self-cleaning process.

The current design currently have 4 fixed points on each side for camera angles, one important note is that if you remove the arm, flip it over, and snap it back on, it actually has slightly different positions. The intention was to get 8 usable positions.

https://preview.redd.it/05zngonkcl1b1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=117559f1278ba9ea13af61cbf8e09c3269027426

**Below are just some of the different camera angles asides from my choice at the start, and their viewpoints I think people might find useful:**

https://preview.redd.it/slzxsx6mcl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d29cab9a75bdbd8be3958d35e7511723ccefea4

https://preview.redd.it/5zau55pncl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b3c6b0ec893b7bd8f72f58a9b2cf158da952809b

**Conclusion:**

The Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is a promising accessory that adds value to the Litter Robot 4 experience. It solves light bleed issues with the Litter Robot 4 night light sensors.

Its ease of installation, facilitated by the snap-in mechanism, is a standout feature that makes it an attractive option for pet owners looking to enhance their monitoring capabilities.

Overall, the Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount shows promise, but enhancements in camera compatibility with extra attachments available could propel it even more.

As this is an early review, it is important to keep in mind that Whisker may address these concerns in future product updates."
"At the End of My RopeHi everyone, just looking for some support or advice. My cat started using the litter robot great day one, but then has progressively become more and more afraid of it over time. I have now found that she was peeing inside one of those wool cave beds while also using the litter robot every day or so (hardwood floor damage‚Äînot happy). Does anyone have any advice as to behavior regression with the litter robot? Or how to make it more appealing?"

"LR 3 Connect- Customer Service gone quietHello, have an issue w/LR3 Connect not connecting to wifi.  Spent 8-10 hrs trying different configurations using the legacy app and the new whisker app, adding the robot's mac address to my network, etc.  Got in touch w/customer service and they asked me additional questions but it's been nearly a week without any answer.  Called three times leaving my phone number for call back and sitting on queue for 40+ mins, still nothing....

What gives w/the customer service?  Looks like LR4 went live and must be getting inundated, but at least email me back!!!  I'm a repeat customer going from LR2 globe to LR3 connect and have been unable to use LR3 connect as intended for over a month.

Any suggestions?  Any customer reps filtering reddit?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*7/24 update\*\*\*

 \*\*\*Appears this is a common issue with older LR3 Connects for Serials LR3C. There was a firmware update for the physical base which appears to be hit or miss in terms of customers having to spend money to ""update.""

Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/o47q6u/connect\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/o47q6u/connect_not_working/)

**Received response: 7/23 via email**

Well after several days I received a response via email with two options:

1.) Restoration/Repair- $180 + tax +$10 shipping so \~$200+ (I suspect this is the updated base as indicated in the source above).

2.) Replace for a new unit $494 + tax or base $359 + tax (10% loyalty discount)

LR is not standing behind their product. I bought a $499 unit three years ago to specifically have wifi capabilities and now to not be able to use because of their own firmware update and having to shell out an additional $200 to make it wifi capable is unacceptable.

I'm 15-hrs + into this project with the troubleshooting and now back and forth with LR Customer Service. I'm documenting this for any future customers that have similar issues. I've been a loyal customer (purchased LR 2 and LR 3 connect- spent over $850 for this product) and I am giving them the opportunity to make this right.

**I have responded to Whisker requesting an updated base/equipment to make it compliant with the firmware and will update back as I receive a response.**"
"Should I get a Litter-Robot?Hi all, I've been looking at a lot of automatic litter trays for my two young cats. I initially dismissed the Litter-Robot because I thought the design looked straight out of the 1980s and was drawn to the cool looking Kickstarter backed designs with Wi-Fi and app integration. However, the reviews for many of those devices have been disappointing, with poor customer service. I just saw that LR has brought out a 3rd gen unit ‚Äì available in grey (which looks much better) ‚Äì and is WiFi capable, but I'm still sceptical despite the many good reviews. I need your help convincing me!  


**My main concerns are:** 

* Soiled litter leaving marks and detritus on the inside of the globe as it rotates - is this down to the type of litter you use and how long you leave it before it clumps? I use Cat's Best Organic Wood Granule Clumping Cat Litter, it clumps pretty quickly so I would hope this would be OK but let me know your experiences! I don't want my kitties fur getting covered in their own waste.
* Seems quite a few people suffer from problems with the globe becoming stuck or something causing it to stop rotating? What causes this normally?
* The 90-day trial is a big draw for me as it lessens the risk I'll be buying a big lemon that sits in the corner of the room and never gets used. How are people's experiences with LR customer service in this regard?   


Thanks all, appreciate any help you can offer!"
"LR 3 with or without WiFiI have the opportunity to buy a used LR3 on fb but it doesn‚Äôt have WiFi capabilities. The guy is asking for $250, but I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm missing out on the true experience without the app or am I overthinking it and it‚Äôs just as useful regardless? 

Also, is $250 a fair price?


Idk if this helps but I have 2 cats. A boy orange tabby and a black short hair girl. They have been giving my two normal litter boxes hell and I can‚Äôt keep up üòÇ"
Alexa skill? It seems to me that it would be helpful if there was an Alexa skill that declares for all to hear that litter needs added or the drawer is full so one person isn't responsible for keeping track of it in the app. I didn't see anything in the Alexa app...
"LR3 DFI & Pinch issuesHi all, hoping someone can help me with this issue as I'm beyond frustrated!

I have 2 LR3s and an LR2. I LOVE my LR2 - she's around 18 years old and still works like a freaking champ, even if I do need to eventually get around to replacing the groaning motor :D My LR3s on the other hand... nothing but frustration. BOTH have the issue mentioned in the title. Power on and blue ready light flashes. Press reset and the yellow light fast flashes. I've tried bypassing the pinch detector on one of them (electrical tape trick after verifying neither tab has any corrosion), however the error still persists. Neither cycles at all. 

Whiskers is supposedly sending me a new DFI for one of the LR3s, and I've just submitted a ticket for the 2nd. In the meantime, I'm stuck scooping multiple normal boxes for a spoiled 6 year old & a 5month old who both think litter boxes should all be miraculously clean every time they enter... 

If anyone has suggestions for either bypassing the pinch detector and/or convincing the system that the drawer isn't full (a little funny, considering there isn't even a bag in it at this point!) that don't include replacing the DFI, I'd be incredibly grateful!"
"Solution for the most common LR3 failureThis is for those that are out of warranty or want to quickly fix their LR3's infamous blue flashing light, (Drawer full message), yellow fast flashing light (pinch detect) or are experiencing a labored motor sound when in cycle that eventually results in a Over torque fault, (Alternating yellow to red lights). These conditions are a direct result of the DFI failing.

The issue with the LR3's DFI is the fact the emitter board's I/O expander chip pins are being subjected to excessive moisture causing corrosion on the bank of pins that are exposed by the DFI shield's opening located at it's center is breaching the inadequate clearcoat that's suppose to render the circuit boards moisture resistant. (I've also noticed some of the solder joints to be less than adequate as well contributing to the issue). As a result 1 or more of the chips pins are experiencing tarnishing and corrosion creating bad solder joints. (the solder used has a high silver content and little to no lead, when silver is exposed to moisture it tarnishes, it turns, you guessed it?!, BLACK!)I have 3 LR3's and they all have suffered the same issue. When they were in warranty I had the DFI kits sent out and I kept the old DFI's. When the third one went I noticed the tarnishing on the chip pins, so I took a look a look at the old replaced DFI's and sure enough the same tarnished corrosion on the same spot!

The good news is its salvageable without replacement!!! The fix is to remove the DFI from the base unit, carefully clean as much of the corrosion off the pins as possible and re-solder all 10 pins on that side of the chip. Verify the work, clean all the flux off, and use a clear coat to seal the chip pins up so the problem doesn't return!!!

I've done this to many DFI boards and they work perfectly! I've only had one I/O chip failure and the replacement part literally is $1.50!!, It's a no-brainer financially!!! To me re-soldering SMT (Surface Mount Technology) components is fairly easy and if you have the solder skills, Awesome!.  Unfortunately to most its rocket science. But!, if you know someone that can do it or have an electronics repair shop in your area its literally a 5 to 10 minute job!!! And it will in 99.999% of the time get you back up and running once again!."
"Pinching My Fingers!I must be doing something wrong. 

I'm still a relatively new user. Every time I change the bag, my fingers get pinched or scraped when I push each of the four edges down into the holder prongs. 

Is there a skill or trick to this? 

2 cats, so I'm doing this every 3 days or so."
"It's now been a couple months and the notification issue is still ongoing for my LR3.Is the engineering team working on it completely inept? The app can perfectly read the levels of litter, but just refuses to notify me when it's full. Wonderful that the product I paid extra for can't do it's most important feature. Time to update my previously positive review on several sites... Tired of being told that it's being worked on.. Probably will check the other litter machine options next time I'm in the market for buying a device for hundreds of dollars. I'm sure those companies are competent enough to ensure basic features work."
"DFI Kit Replacement SuccessJust wanted to share a positive support experience I had.

A week ago, the pinch detector went off, and since then, the device stopped working. Did a full cleaning, triple checked the pinch detector was clear with no litter and verified that the circuit was complete with a multimeter - something else was wrong. The app just showed an exclamation mark with no error description, and the board was blinking the blue ""ready"" light slowly.

I called support, they treated me like a competent individual (rare for support teams) and offered to send me a replacement DFI kit (sensor linked to the pinch detector). It came in under a week, I followed the relatively clear instructions for dissasembling and replacing the sensor, put it all back together, and the litterbot is back to working normally.

Thanks!"
"We‚Äôve had this thing for less than 2 months and I just noticed this separation. Anyone else?It hasn‚Äôt moved since we set it up, not bumped by the vacuum or anything. Pretty frustrating considering the price."
"Litter Robot 3 Connect Wifi IssuesI FINALLY got my new litter robot to connect to my WiFi after hours of troubleshooting and searching on Reddit. I have Xfinity WiFi, and ended up having to separate my WiFi into two bands (5Ghz and 2.4Ghz) so the litter robot could connect to the 2.4Ghz.

The issue is now that my WiFi connection throughout my home is awful. We never had issues when the connections were merged and now can barely use the WiFi. My question is, since I got the WiFi connected, can I switch it back to the merged version or does it need to say separate for the litter robot to continue working? I tried to change the WiFi in the robot settings but it won‚Äôt connect. I saw a couple places that it only needed 2.4Ghz for the initial connection but not sure how that works moving forward. Can anyone share their experience? Thank you!!

"Debating returning LR4 due to curtain sensorsMy cat is happily using the LR4 and overall I like it. Well, I like the concept. 

However, it is constantly getting the cycle interrupted, and the interruption doesn‚Äôt get resolved so eventually it just turns off, stuck in whatever position it interrupted in. Most of the time, that‚Äôs an unusable state for the cat. Sometimes, it interrupts when the litter is pooled to one extreme side, so the calibration error is thrown. So I have to go and shake the box around until the litter settles more towards the bottom, so I can finally reset the box. I am resetting or troubleshooting this box at least once a day. Some days, it has been every time the cat uses the LR4.

The LR4 is on a solid piece of concrete floor. The floor underneath is clean, and I have vacuumed it religiously. I clean the curtain sensors every day when I inevitably go to reset the LR4. I de-fur the felt strips every day as the cat‚Äôs long fur can get a few small clumps in it.  I‚Äôve taken the LR4 apart many times, checking for anything snagging or obstructing. I know it isn‚Äôt the cat cause I‚Äôll be standing right next to the box when it gets interrupted and I can‚Äôt see anything that could possibly be interrupting it.

My last Hail Mary is trying a less dusty, non-clay litter. It‚Äôs very arid where I live, so don‚Äôt know if the dust and the static is messing up the sensors. I ordered some clumping grass litter that promised low dust, so we will see.

If I am going to spend 5+ minutes every day troubleshooting a litter box, I might as well just use a normal litter box and save $650. Daily scooping only takes a minute. I am still in the 90 day trial window, so if the less dusty litter doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs going back. I am out of ideas."
"Disabling motion sensor(s) on Litter Robot 4?I have a long haired car that sheds a lot, and his hair constantly gets on and in the motion sensor which causes it to pause mid-clean cycle multiple times per day. 

Today while out Christmas shopping it paused, and we came home to poop on the carpet because it was stuck in an unusable state. 

Is there any way to disable the motion sensor so it won‚Äôt get triggered by some stray hair? Or what else are my options to bypass it? I tried putting some tape over the sensors so hair couldn‚Äôt get in there but the lights just turn red and it doesn‚Äôt move at all. At this point the machine is worse than a standard litter box since at least we won‚Äôt come home to poop on the floor."
"My LR4 review never got published at litter-robot.comTitle: Disappointed, we'll keep it? temporary 2 stars.

10/02/2022 I must state that the unit is not that it doesn't worth it... IT DOESN'T WORTH IT FOR ME, but I also understand that this is not only about the money you invest on it but the convenience of having a constant clean sand for your cats which is a lot more hygienic for them, but also for you as well, removing the burden of keeping it clean by yourself, so... said that, I think there is a lot of people that put all these in weight, and at the end, this unit, good or bad, FOR ME, the brand is actually the best available, and this comment comes from my ACTUAL, LONG and PRIOR researches on the ""best"" units available,... unfortunately, well impressed with LR3, I missed reviews on LR4.  
This is my story... After looking at the operation of LR3 at a friend's home and listening to what amazing it is after one year of use and the well-constructed, thaaaaaat modern, slick and fancy look, I decided to go for it!,.. I thought, they both, Tobbi and Diego (4 YO and 5 Wo) worth it!... and even better... there is a new iteration of it with a bunch of new features with a tag of plus dollars as well of course!... anyways, I got it!  
It just arrived today and I'm incredible exited for it!!!......... :) :) :) :) :)  
First impression!..... Very nice packaging!...  
Aaaaaaad..... THAAAAATS IT!!!....... :( :( :( :(  
Weak, cheap construction and the worst quality control on the process and final product, gaps and uneven surfaces all over the parts' joints/edges.... huuuuugues!!!!, the waste drawer doesn't seal at all with a big gap and uneven edge running all the way along the bottom of it.... (for all of these, video available), I should've gotten a little bit more into reviews before this purchase, which is my way,... I was that impressed with the performance of LR3 though, that I didn't even though it twice..., my bad! ...  
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!...  
S E V E N H U N D R E D D O L L A R S!!!! FOR THIS!!!!...  
It really hurts!... this is not about the money expensed but the sense of being ripped off... I still don't believe it happened to me! For a THAAAAAT well established and THAAAAAT good, reputed business... shame on you!!!!!!  
But there is more!...  
Hidden information!... for the time being since arrival of the unit (several hours now), I have researched on specs not DIRECT available at advertising... and compared to LR3, the internal size of the globe is 2 INCHES shorter in depth, which added to the 1 inch (advertised) in width, leads to a significantly smaller volume for your cat to move around for its businesses, for which you need to take that in consideration for larger cats.... as mine :( :( :(.  
I still have 3 months ahead of me to test the operation of LR4, most likely I'll return it at the end of the home trial... at least, one needs some kind of satisfaction after the ""fiasco"", so I'll use LR4 for the full home trial, then to decide the road to follow, and in the meanwhile, I'll continue closely following up on the operation of the LR3, for which apparently, everybody is very, very satisfied with and while convinced, I think I'll get LR3 latter.  
I'll post an update in some weeks on following the operation of ""my"" LR4 that hopefully will be useful for any person interested on...  
Stars may go lower.? I don't think so after my research on ""reputed"" brands availabe... going the stars up, neither think so. The 2 stars now, account for the 100% satisfaction on operation that I foresee as positive after use in the following weeks, and mostly based on the current operation of the reputed LR3, FOR WHICH I DONT REALLY BELIEVE, the brad is going to put at risk after that many years of building it.... except for ""feel"", as cheap constructed, and ""look"", about those BIG and UNEVEN gaps and joints, and not the operation of the unfortunate LR4, which I insist, anticipate as totally satisfactory... We'll see................... 

12/20/2022 UPDATE

Firstly, 5 stars to customer support, if there was option to add more I would. No questions asked, I just explained my situation in few, jut few words, and they promptly responded offering a replacement unit right away, the only downside was having to wait more than an hour for somebody to pick up the call. The free replacement unit arrived in one week including return of the faulty one at no charge. Up and running again!!!! Just amazing!!!

All explained about the arrival of the first unit above. 

For more than a moth it operated as expected with minor issues mostly related to dust and hair? at the sensors, which I consider totally normal for the type of product and use, this is, litter, hairy family pets and movement, so I focused on 2-3 time a week for a quick cleaning at the sensor with a brush and some dry air, and no big deal, ready to go..... for few more weeks ony... then it stared to get stuck upside down and red leds at control panel, in both manual and automatic operation, the waste way facing the waste drawer, always in the same position, no matter what you do to try to resolve it, which is not that much... cleaning, thorough cleaning, power down and power back up, review for loose screws, reset to factory setting, unboarding (is this an actual english word?), resetting network... then, the worst... unresponsive control panel at any command. Is at this point that I decided to contact customer service; having a $700 DOLLARS unit just sitting there with no use, well, I just gave up and grabbed the phone, which I try to avoid at all cost (no matter the supplier, all of them) because usually they just go by the book, have no practical experience in their products and most of the time, I end up resolving the issues by myself. Case resolved immediately and I'm very satisfied... so far!... 

CONLCUSIONS

I'm industrial Engineer and understand about production process and interactions of elements involved, bothn at technology development and actual production, and there is ALWAYS, always  room for error and faulty products, and that's why there are always WARRANTY linked to your acquisitions as well; no matter how expensive your Lamborghini is, IT MIGHT COME FAULTY... and it's expected that some of us will get it... well, this time it was me... not a Lamobirghini.... I wish!!!!.... just not there yet! . 

THE GOOD

\- One more star.... 3 now.... yeeeeeeeee!

\- Customer service. Thombs up!!!!!!!!!!!!

\- For BETTER or WORSE, and from many comments and reviews I've read for all those automatic litter boxes in the market, MY PERSONAL conclusion is that this is the best brand to stick with. This is an American company and you relay in their LOCAL support, repair and parts availability.... and no, this review is not sponsored, not looking for it, I'm just paying back to the community, that speaking out has led me to get the best products in the market, that's it.

\- Replacement unit a little bit better constructed, internal litter screen better fitted and tighter to the globe by the bottom edge, the faulty unit has it totally loose and never liked passing through some waste to the litter compartment while cycling, the globe lid better fitted as well with a tighter and easier locking/unlocking grasp.

\-  Looks like electronics still at pretty good level.

\- Wider opening to the globe, more comfortable for entering/exiting the globe.

\- Detection sensor for kittens and actual waste in the drawer.

\- Pets weight detection for health follow up.

\- More comprehensive app and app controls.

THE BAD

\- Cheap fabrication materials? Don't know, it could be the reason for contractions at cooling after casting, leading to all those big gaps at part's joints and external-bottom waste drawer unfitting/bad odor sealing, these are unacceptable for a company with this good reputation and expensive products.

\- Smaller internal globe than LR3, even LR3 is small in general, and I'd say, we family pet's owners want the best for our family, right? For the price, I think is possible to provide more comfort... and I also say we're willing to sacrifice some space in favor of them as well! which is not that much actually... when I see Tobi, our eldest at 4 YO, struggling to cover his ""gracias"" as we say in spanish, I just feel sad :( ... (there are several uses for the ""gracias"" word, not ""thank you"" only, it depends on what you're talking about).

THE UNKNOWN

\- Was the faulty one, just a random AND EXPECTED off in quality control? or it is actually a FLAW in the development of this iteration of the product that may lead to a total crash in the market?... I have read too many reviews and comments about LR4 and from that, I'm not conclusive yet.

\- For the good of my pets, I'll follow up with the operation of the unit and will attempt to continue posting updates."
"My LR3 motherboard fried...So I made my own instead.

**tl;dr:** Litter Robot 3 motherboard fried, decided to make my own instead. Was lots of fun *and* way cheaper, 10/10 would do it again. Code and schematics on github, link below.

---

So... One sorry day of December, 2021, my Litter Robot 3 started acting weird.

First, it gave me a fast-flashing blue light, switching to slow yellow when pressing Reset. Then it started to freeze at bootup on a solid yellow light - no amount of cleaning or making sure the connectors were all secure helped. Nor did sanding the pinch detector, either.

Unfortunately, at that moment, it was just out of warranty, so my only option was to buy a new motherboard, and those things are expensive.

It turns out, the Litter Robot 3 is made of pretty simple electronics. Hell, the ""CPU"" on there is a PIC 16F microcontroller. There had to be a way to get all this to work again.

So, here's how this fail-safe (/s) machine works :
 * The biggest part of it is a 12V motor + reduction gear set that rotates the drum back and forth (with the gearset making it slow, but super high torque)
 * The drum contains tiny neodymium magnets, triggering hall sensors that act as end stop switches
 * The ""cat sensor"" is a simple load-sensitive resistor
 * The pinch detector is a basic mechanical switch made of two metal pieces
 * The most complex part apart from the motherboard is the DFI sensor, which I haven't reimplemented yet but shouldn't be too much of an issue.

The parts most prone to fail in there are the motherboard and the DFI sensors, which in my opinion look *way* over-engineered. 

*Cue a side-look to an ESP32 board lying on my desk...*

With all that in mind, I settled to making my own alternative motherboard out of an ESP32. Since I'm not going to be using the stock motherboard's form factor, using the original button placements is out of the way.

All parts included, I was able to make my own for around $15. When I make a final PCB instead of the prototyping board I used it shouldn't exceed $20.

I decided to ditch buttons altogether instead, switching to a fully remote control via a web app served directly from the ESP32, allowing for much finer control over the litterbox's settings.

No more beating around the bush, here's [the GitHub repository to the whole thing](https://github.com/xtrium-lnx/litter-eater).

The repo contains the complete electronic schematics, full source code (using the Arduino IDE) with (some) documentation about how I implemented this... thing.

Here are the features it currently has :
 * Over-the-air updating for when I screw around with code / when more features come along
 * Capture portal to connect it to your home Wifi network
 * Full control over the timings, from the delay before sifting to overshooting endstops (either to make litter horizontal again or to help with dumping)
 * Makes your fried Litter Robot eat cat poop again :')

What's left to do :
 * Pinch detection
 * Drawer full detection
 * (Maybe) Cat detection depending on weight
 * Push notifications when your cats go in or when the drawer's full

Edit: added a few details about the webapp."
"Cycle Light Flashing Yellow RapidlyHi LitterRobot fam‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm kind of frustrated because the last couple of days my LitterRobot has been falsely triggering the ‚Äúfull‚Äù notification. The ‚Äúready‚Äù button would flash blue and I have gotten notifications on my app that the robot was full. I figured something was on the sensor so I wiped the sensors off tonight down in the litter tray compartment.

Now, the ‚Äúready‚Äù light flashes blue and when I press the reset button, the ‚Äúcycling‚Äù light flashes yellow/amber rapidly. I Googled this and seems to be an indicator that the weight or anti-pinch sensors are being tripped (based on the flashing yellow/amber ‚Äúcycling‚Äù light).

I unplugged the robot and disassembled and used a q-tip to swipe around the metal anti-pinch sensors to see if this might help clear the issue but it has not. It‚Äôs really nerve-wracking because this happened today and I have three cats who depend on using this to go to the restroom.

Any ideas, help, or insight someone can share? I‚Äôve NEVER had a problem until this and now I feel (dramatic-emphasis) hopeless! üòû"
"What to do when she‚Äôs in a cone?My baby girl is finally (hopefully) getting spayed next week after months of trying to figure out her chronic health issues before surgery.

She acclimated really well to the LR and she‚Äôs been using it for months now. But I‚Äôm working on getting her desensitized to a cone and it doesn‚Äôt seem to fit in the LR. I guess I should just break out her old litter box once she gets home from the procedure, and leave it uncovered. Are there any tips to this sort of... taking a break from the LR and then going back to it? (I‚Äôm in a small apartment and the litter box is in the living room so this is especially important to my roommates and me.)"
"Ramp / Other Accessories Necessary?I just got a 4 month old kitty and he's good to go with a normal litter box. I'm planning to get a Litter Robot after reading a ton of information.

He's going to be a bit floofy cat as he is a Siberian Forest Cat.

I'm putting it in a small laundry room (stacking my current washer / dryer) so it will be a pain to remove the ramp to empty the bin. How necessary would you say the ramp is? 

Also, any other accessory suggestions? It's expensive to order from these sites in Canada due to shipping so any help would be super appreciated. :)"
"Pinch Sensor / DFI issue - Please Help.Hey, so I have been troubleshooting an issue that started last night with my 14 month old LR3 that has a blinking blue light and when I press the reset blinks fast yellow. After research I found that this is most likely the dreaded bad DFI sensor. The problem I‚Äôm having is that I have to leave for work tomorrow morning for two days and I have two cats that depend on it so I‚Äôm looking for ways to resolve the issue even as a hack while the replacements come in. 

I have already tried the pinch sensor bypass and cleaning out the whole thing by taking it apart, both without luck  

Does anyone have any ideas that can help me out? Is there something that is known to go bad on the sensor that can be cleaned or re solder?"
"SuggestionI've been considering to buy a robot for a while now. But I'm still not convinced to make this investment. My requirement is for a litterbox that allows me to leave my cats alone for a short period of time. The litterboxes as their are now are perfect for one cat, ok for 2 but don't scale enough for more.

So I've been thinking that maybe for the next iteration of the product you can design it so that the litter container can be optionally bigger, maybe by swapping a ""default"" piece with a bigger one. That way one would be able to get the right size depending on how many pets he has.

Edit:

For instance, you could sell some aftermarket ""accessory"" or a variant of the base model that replaces the bottom drawer with a bigger one double the size. This in turn would make the unit taller (I guess a taller ladder accessory would be advisable then). Personally for this kind of product is not height but width and depth the limiting factors. And enlarging the drawer wouldn't add up to the surface. But having the option one would be free to trade size with capacity. As I said for one cat the product is already perfect as it is. Mine is just a wish for multi pet owners. I agree that poo shouldn't stay inside for longer than one week though (something less in summer). Just in case the app should just remind you that a clean up is advisable.

Edit 2:

Another idea for multi cat owners. Chip reader? One of my cats today had issues. Wouldn't be nice if you could know which one had to use it 4 times in 2 hours without being there watching?"
"Gravity Mode or Scheduled Feedings?Deciding how to use the Feeder-Robot depends on your pet‚Äôs eating habits. If your dog or cat has a habit of overeating or eating very quickly, you may wish to schedule your pet‚Äôs meals. By scheduling meals, your pet will be eating a measured amount, 1 to 8 times a day.

If your pet has no issue with overeating and tends to ‚Äúgraze‚Äù throughout the day (this is more likely with cats than dogs), you may wish to use Gravity Mode. In Gravity Mode, the Feeder-Robot Food Bowl remains full based on a check every 6 hours."
"What timing delay do you use?Understand it may be litter dependant, but I am curious what time settings most of you use.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ko003o)"
What is the waste capacity of the L4 drawer?How much waste can the L4 drawer hold before it registers as full? I feel like mine registers full so quickly when there is so little waste. I can‚Äôt imagine they would design such a large drawer yet only allow minimal waste capacity. It feels inefficient and wasteful. Is this normal or is my sensor off?
"LR4s most undersold feature: redesigned waste bin = more useable capacityI have had our LR3 for nearly 3 years and been quite happy with it. We have 2 cats and with the LR3, I‚Äôd get 1.5-2 days out of the waste drawer before a full alert, and then I‚Äôd need to shake the waste bin a couple of times but ultimately only getting ~3.5 days between changing the trash bag (which I used in place of liners). 

With the LR4, I set it up and installed it on Sunday of this week (5 days ago!) and have yet to touch it. According to the app its 80% full. I took the drawer out and because of the increased height (overall volume may not be any bigger), the litter no longer mounds up triggering full alerts, it‚Äôs actually filling up the whole space. I‚Äôll probably get another day out of it.

Anyway, just wanted to share that because this is huge for me. Less time I have to deal with litter and helps make things easier when we are going to be gone for a few days. 

Of course, I had to put a couple of scoops of fresh litter in over the last 5 days but no big deal there IMO. :)

Obligatory not a Whisker shill. I paid for this with my own money."
I'd like to put my litter robot over a large trash can so that I almost never have to change it. Has anyone tried this?
"LR3 or LR4 for being out of town?Hi everyone! 

After spending hours in this sub (and elsewhere online), I‚Äôve decided to get a LR. The only question is LR3 or LR4? For a TLDR: feel free to skip to 6 & 7 below.

It seems like a gamble either way. And I‚Äôm willing to take that gamble at this point, but I would really appreciate users weighing in on which one they think is (or, even better, experience as) more likely to be less buggy. I know this is just getting anecdotal evidence, and the amount of variables in each report arguably make this ask counterproductive, but I‚Äôm asking nonetheless lol

The person I had lined up to handle my cat‚Äôs litter had to bail, so I‚Äôve gotta take the pricey plunge before my 10 day trip next month (Don‚Äôt worry, my cat won‚Äôt be alone! She lives with a bunch of people who have no problem feeding/watering/interacting with her. I just don‚Äôt want them to have to deal with her litter.) 

Some takeaways I‚Äôve gathered from my research:
1) Both LR3 & LR4 have their issues, and it‚Äôs ordinary to replace parts or entire units if necessary. That seems kind of like it‚Äôs part of the experience (which is not great for such an expensive product).
2) Fortunately, Whisker‚Äôs customer service is solid. 
3) Gradual acclimation and patience are likely necessary to train the transition. Including not letting a skittish kitty see cycling until she‚Äôs comfortable enough to use it. 
4) Proper maintenance goes a long way. 
5) Smart switches are not recommended by Whisker, but users report positive experiences with them in case of needing to manually power cycle while away. 

6) LR4‚Äôs waste tray has a slightly bigger capacity and is quieter, which is why I‚Äôm leaning toward it. 

I‚Äôm not sure about this one, but
7) LR3 has maybe had more time on the market to be less buggy than LR4?

I know there are a lot of LR3 vs. LR4 threads, but this one is meant to be geared toward the prospective buyer who‚Äôs gonna be out of town, and wants to take their best shot at the dang thing just working. Sincerely, thank you in advance!

Btw I‚Äôll gladly use anyone‚Äôs referral, especially if it comes with a helpful comment!"
"Is this a normal amount of waste for the drawer to be full in the LR4?This thing is driving me crazy with how often it says it's full since it stops cycling. We have 3 cats but it says it's full in less than 24 hours pretty often. At first, we thought it might be the Kitty Poo Club silica litter so we switched to the LR litter but the issue continues to persist. I zero it every time and have tried recalibrating but to no avail.
Picture here - https://imgur.com/a/C6zyybd
That is after doing 4 or 5 manual cycles while it thought it was full. Does this look right?
I feel like for a piece of tech this expensive, the app should let you set and change the capacity and adjust it when it's not actually full"
What features do you want to see added to the next generation of Litter Robot?
"I really hope the LR4 works..Hello!

I have been using LR3 since 2018. I loved the idea of it for our two cats. Well, I didn't realize it, but apparently somehow some urine got in between the globe and liner. I didn't know about it. I kept cleaning the globe, the tray, liner... everything with baking soda/vinegar, just white vinegar an water, and dawn dish soap. I kept smelling the box and I didn't understand.. this was months out. I then figured out the liner and globe were separate..

I had the extended warranty and  I explained the situation. CS was nice and sent out a brand new liner. I installed it and noticed a huge difference... and then it started getting smelly again. I'm pretty sure the smell has embedded in the plastic somehow... because it was so expensive, we just tried to clean it and change the liter as much as we can to help with the smell.

We then got another cat and the LR was getting full quick. We decided to buy a refurb LR3. (right before LR4 came out apparently) This has helped with the capacity problem. But no matter what I do, I smell cat urine. Ever since I was pregnant and had the baby, I feel my sense of smell has increased. Also, I've noticed unfortunately the smell is causing me to have headaches...

Before even thinking of buying another LR, we tried adding odor absorbers near the litter box, baking soda in the litter, changing the litter, adding scented trash can bags, changing the filter. I feel like it's a lost cause. And on top of that, they both are giving me rotation errors and things like that.

I did some research on the internet for automated litter boxes. There are a lot but unfortunately LR is still coming out as the best brand. 

I talked my hubby into getting an LR4. I'm really hoping this helps the problem especially since they added the odor thing on the back.

 Is the liner built into this LR the same as LR 3? It says on the website that it can handle up to 4 cats... does the drawer seem deeper for capacity?

&#x200B;

I really having high hopes for this. I've noticed that people are having issues but at the same time other people are not. I can only cross my fingers..."
"Elevation idea?So, after getting an LR3 second hand that one of our cats was terrified of, we bit the bullet and got an LR4.  Night and day difference for the cat.  Immediate adoption.  There have been some weird issues with connectivity and operation, but the last week or two it seems to have ironed itself out.  Part of those issues I think was the dog interrupting the cycle, which is why I am looking to elevate the unit.

But this also brings up my biggest complaint about the unit which is the abysmal bin size.  So, I was thinking about making a platform for it that houses a larger container for waste and Dremel'ing out the bottom of the unit for the waste to fall.  This would get the dog out of there and also increase capacity.  Has anyone tried something like this?"
"Litter Robot 4 Shipping Thread***Whisker put together a shipping estimate page on their website so this thread isn't really needed anymore. I'll still update this thread as long as people keep posting just in case but unless their estimates are way off I would just reference their post. I'll link both the post on their website and their Reddit post below.***

[Link to their website with shipping estimates.](https://support.litter-robot.com/s/lr4-delivery-schedule?language=en_US)

[Link to their Reddit post with shipping estimates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/wvwfcg/litterrobot_shipping_schedule_support_ticket/)

**TLDR & Whisker update in bold below**

*(Updated August 25th - 11:00 AM EST)*

In order to hopefully consolidate all the posts about shipping time inquiries (specifically for the black version but for the white version as well) people can just post here their model type, order dates, and shipping times.  Makes it way easier than digging through a ton of different threads and random posts to see if it should have shipped yet.

I'll keep the main TLDR section updated using comments from this thread daily until they're at least caught up and shipping same week.

I am also kindly asking people to stop bogging down Whiskers support staff with shipping notification inquiries as well, unless your order date range falls within the time it *should* have shipped.  This would help free up their staff to assist other customers with actual order, software, or hardware issues.  I know the delay is frustrating but unfortunately there isn't much anyone can do about it so it's best to just sit tight and wait!  There's no reason to go complain and yell at their support staff over something that's not their fault and they have no control over.

Regarding Shipping **-** If you're on vacation or out of town when it is scheduled to be delivered and you do not want it sitting on your front porch while you're gone you  can ask FedEx to hold onto your package for up to a 14 day period.

**UPDATE FROM WHISKER:**  *(from a response sent to* [HippyGroove](https://www.reddit.com/user/HippyGroove/) \- *7/28th)*

*""Thanks for contacting Whisker!*

*As we increased our manufacturing capacity for the Litter-Robot 4, we made the decision to add a texture to the exterior of the black Litter-Robot 4‚Äôs lower base and bonnet. This tooling change will improve the overall modern appearance of the unit while providing increased scratch resistance to the outer surface. As a result of this change we are running approximately three weeks behind on deliveries of black Litter-Robot 4 units. This will affect customers who ordered between May 17, 2022 and June 13, 2022. Rest assured, though, that your order is still prioritized in our queue based on your order date, and your new estimated ship date will be emailed to you.*

*If you did want to change to a white unit, we would need to cancel this order and have you place a new one in the white instead. Unfortunately that would start the lead time of 5-7 weeks over, though, so my advice would be to keep the black order. We are working to get those pushed out just as quickly as we can.*

*To thank you for your patience, and to show our appreciation for your support, we will be including a free gift with your order. This will be included in your Litter-Robot 4 box.""*

"LR4 Completely Broke after 2 WeeksIs anyone else having this issue or have solutions for it? I am beyond frustrated with my purchase of the LR4. Not only did it take 6 extra weeks to arrive after I was told with the pre-order that it would be here in July, but it only ""worked"" for about two weeks. While it worked it was great, but that was very short lived. After those two weeks I have been faced constantly with the solid red bar and notifications such as ""cat sensor fault"" ""cycle interrupted"" ""cycle paused"" and there is nothing blocking the sensors, no cat in the litter box, nothing. I have tried calling the company, their phones are shut down due to high volume of calls, I have tried emailing the company only to not get a response, I have tried the chat function that is pushed so hard, and it never works, I have even tried contacting them on Instagram to be met only with automated responses, now I‚Äôm trying Reddit, maybe I‚Äôll have better luck? I have done everything possible listed under troubleshooting for the LR4: cleaning the sensors, emptying the entire thing, resetting the system by pushing down the reset and connect until it turns off then wait two minutes then turn back on, removing the globe to empty and clean it, I have tried everything. Nothing works. It may ""fix"" the issue for 30 seconds, only for it to start cycling and then proceed to have a cat sensor failure and then stops completely while the globe is all the way upside down. For obvious reasons, my cats can't use the litter box when the litter is covered and it is stuck ""emptying"" and I'm getting tired of my hardwood floors getting ruined because they are going to the bathroom outside of the litter box because it consistently doesn't work. I am very upset, frustrated, disappointed in the fact that I spent so much money on what came highly recommended to me, only to be met with so many problems and no solutions. I'm not sure what else to do since I am not receiving communication back in any capacity. The entire thing doesn‚Äôt work anymore whatsoever. üòï"
"LR4- How does it calculate drawer space used / remaining?I received my LR4 this week and my cat is in the ""ring and run"" stage where she hops in and out of the box several times a day but doesn't actually use it.   History shows 19 cleaning cycles run and 25% of the drawer capacity currently full...but opening the drawer reveals only about a shot glass worth of individual clean litter pieces that have accumulated.  Does the LR4 calculate drawer capacity used with a weight sensor (if so, do I likely have an issue?), is it simply doing math (every cycle uses X% drawer capacity?), or is there another way its calculating capacity used?"
"Help with the world‚Äôs most robot spoiled catWe have a cat that has only known the litter robot experience in his life, in a 2 cat household.

About a month ago, he started to pee on the floor if the litterbox is not perfectly clean. We put a camera in the room to identify which cat it was and to try and see if there are health issues.

What we found is that if it isn‚Äôt 100% clean, he will look inside the box and then pee on the floor. Mostly this happens if the capacity has just recently been reached (we would then swap the bag that night) but we have also seen it happen if his brother just used it and the timer is waiting to cycle that usage. 

I know that an unacceptably clean litter box can cause cats to do this, but his bar of ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù seems to be far too low because of his litter robot spoiled life. Does anyone have tips for this problem?"
"How long before having to empty?-LR4I‚Äôve had my LR4 set up for 5 full days. 
It‚Äôs currently reading at 55% full.

"Best litter for odor control/strong clumping/ doesn‚Äôt attract bugs?One of my cats is very sensitive to smells and will poop outside if he feels it‚Äôs too smelly near the litter box. 

I‚Äôve tried regular clay litter ( tidy cats) and noticed that it‚Äôs not the best at clumping although it was probably the better odor control litter i‚Äôve used. I absolutely LOVED the clumping capacity that Sustainably Yours/Garfield litter provided but unfortunately since it‚Äôs corn and cassava based it attracted nats every single time and had a very unpleasant odor. 

Any suggestions? 

Ps. I do change the carbon filters every so often."
Can I safely use an extension cord?I emailed customer support but no answer. Is it safe to keep my LR permanently plugged into an extension cord? I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out the power usage and what it means in terms of not exceeding capacity and causing a fire hazard.
"What is the Best Non-Clay Litter for Litter Robot 4I've recently purchased a Litter Robot 4 and am very happy with it.  I'm currently using World's Best litter - corn based - as I don't want to use clay-b ased litter.  


World's Best is performing OK - but it tends to clump and stick to the liner - and according to posts I've read it may have long-term issues with Litter Robot 4.  


So...  


What is the best non-clay litter for Litter Robot 4 as recommended by Whisker?"
"Just got off the phone with support--I'm scheduled to get my 3rd LR4 (2nd replacement). Heed my advice.I don't know why it happens, and I don't know how to fix it (if there is an engineer out there who has reverse-engineered their LR4 and can share some information, I would love to hear from you), but these LR4's seem to work fine immediately out of the box, for a couple of months, and then the issues start to appear. This first replacement unit (2nd LR4) that I have now, I literally placed it on my level, flat, hardwood floor back in February of this year, and I haven't moved it until yesterday when the errors became intolerable. After my experience with my first LR4 unit that I received in the fall of 2022, I knew not to fall prey to hopeful, wishful thinking that the LR4 will just magically start to work properly. This time, I only tolerate ONE cat-shit-outside-the-LR4-on-the-floor-mat, not multiple cat shits on the floor and cat pees on my living room couch like I did over the 2022-2023 winter season. No, f\*\*\* that. I took it into my garage and spent about 6 hours cleaning and troubleshooting, to no success. My LR4 gets stuck at the exact same spot mid-cycle, and there is no way to continue or cancel the cycle using any combination of button-pushes and power-cycles. Once it gets to this one spot mid-cycle, the only way for me to get it back to the home position is to take the bonnet off and manually rotate the globe with my hands.

I don't understand how this company could be so irresponsible and careless. I'm about to receive my third LR4 unit. Third! Whisker must be losing money from this LR4 product... and if they're not, then that thing must be sooooo overpriced that the cost to produce must be close to $50, and the remaining $650 goes to funding all the customer support, tech support, shipping and handling, replacement units, etc.

Why the f\*\*\* didn't this company perform thorough product testing and R&D before releasing this product? And, if they did, and they knew this product was faulty when they released it, then why did they go ahead with the release? Why would the CEO decide to release a bad product and upset a large subset of Whisker's customers?

&#x200B;

My advice to any new LR4 owners is as follows: **do not tolerate the solid-red-lights cycle interruptions.** If your cat(s) is(are) anything like mine, then they probably don't poke their head into the unit while the damn thing is rotating. Most cats, I think, won't do that, because they're literally scaredy-cats. Especially do NOT tolerate solid-red-light cycle interruptions that are difficult or impossible to clear by some combination of button-presses and/or power-cycling the unit. You can try cleaning it, but if you've owned it for at least 1 or 2 months and you start to get these cycle interruptions then it's probably not because of dirt and debris (unless yours is really, really dirty). Do **not** hope and pray that these faults go away. Just pick up the LR4, bring it into your garage or some place where you can troubleshoot it, put out an ol'fashioned litter box for your cat(s), and try to get your damned LR4 to work PROPERLY and CONSISTENTLY. Try to get it to consistently cycle without any interruptions, and don't put it back to use until you are satisfied! Otherwise, you'll probably come home to a pile of cat crap and/or piss because your LR4 got stuck mid-cycle and your cat(s) had nowhere to go #2.

We paid $700 for a big hunk of plastic, a motor, some sensors, and some circuitry. We paid $700 for a product that WORKS, not one that will unexpectedly stop working while you're at work so your cat will ruin your $2000 couch!! We deserve more than that for $700.

Let's say you would otherwise spend 3 minutes, every day, scooping cat litter. After 90 days (the approximately lifetime of these LR4 units, in my experience), that cumulative time is 4.5 hours. Given the $700 that you paid to not have to do all the scooping, that's an hourly rate of $155 per hour."
"Recalibration Fixed OverfillingI don‚Äôt recall anyone ever getting on here to complain about the waste bin getting too full when it says it‚Äôs full. I kept getting litter sludged up all over the carbon filter. This time it got so full that the globe got stuck open because litter was setting off the pinch detect sensors. I performed a recalibration, which was super easy and only took one try for success. It‚Äôs showing what seems to be a much more accurate litter level now. 

I bought the LR4 a few months ago, and other than this issue of overfilling the waste bin, I‚Äôve had flawless results with the LR4. I like it so much more than my LR3."
"No recent activity ?After months of stellar performance - all of a sudden, the app keeps saying no recent activity and I noticed today that the LR4 hadn‚Äôt  cycled after the cats used it! - and it must have been all day because it was turd central. Have to manually go press the cycle button? What the hell???? 

Anyone know anything about this tomfoolery????"
"What is your Litter Robot Voodoo?In another thread, a few of us were talking about the voodoo that must be performed in order to make the LR work when something goes sideways. So what is your LR voodoo?"
Litter Robot 4 wont perform clean cycle
"ExquisiCat Micro Crystals Clumping for LR3?Hi! I typically use the Target brand clumping clay litter but recently the large bucket as been hard to find in my area. I've tried all the other recommended brands by people in this sub and I haven't found one I like as much as the cheap target one LOL I find it preforms just as well as some of the more expensive brands for like half the price. 

I was thinking of trying the Petsmart brand litter and then the clumping micro crystals caught my attention and I was wondering if anyone on this sub uses it? It's pretty expensive for a 7 pound bag compared to clay litter, so I just wanted to get some opinions before I try it out. [This](https://www.petsmart.com/cat/litter-and-waste-disposal/litter/exquisicat-micro-crystals-clumping-multi-cat-silica-cat-litter---unscented-low-dust-30687.html?cgid=200152&fmethod=Browse) is the one I was looking at."
litter recommendationshi! i‚Äôm planning on buying a litter robot 4 soon and was just wondering if anybody had any litter recommendations for optimal performance?
"Litter robot 4 vs Leo's loo too early thoughtsLittle background on two cats I have :

I am new to automatic litter solution since my first 6 year old cat (Sphynx ) liked to use our toilet since she was 4 months old. I only started to appreciate how smart she is when we got another kitten which does not have the same level of intelligence. So after three attempts to train the new cat and finding shit all over my house I gave up. Here come robots.

Purchased Leo's loo too a month ago. Both of my cats started using it from the moment I turned it on. I was not concerned with the smart one since she obviously prefer sand over toilet seat. The new cat also is using it without any issues. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them take a shit and get notifications on it for some odd reason. More on that later. A month in on it, the core function of this robot works as advertised. I mean not a single snag. I have yet to clean it or change the litter in it. The weight function is spotty and not reliable enough to tell the difference between the two cats. They have 4 pound difference and I still can't really tell who went for it.  That's about it.  The only issue was that I had Leo's loo too on the second floor of my house and my cats had second litter box on the first floor. Solution was to get another toy for me and my cats. So obvious choice is to get the same Leos loo too robot and add it on my app. However, Robot 4 adds few more interesting features which Leo does not. I was still concerned about all the reported issues litter robot 4 users had with hardware and software. I still went for it given that Whisker has 90 days return policy and I can send it back.

So I ordered Litter robot 4. for those who are interested , Whisker (Litter -Robot 4 ) had 3-5 day shipping on their site at the time of the order. It ended up being 7 days till it was delivered.

Opened it up and went through the set up within few minutes. Both cats yet again took immediate interest and both relieved themselves in the orderly fashion. No burn in period at all. Both dropped the Duce right away.

I own Leos loo too for a month. I have Litter robot for few days.

Features which **Robot 4** has an upper leg on Leo's loo too:

A. Dumping old sand into the waist bin. This is a big one since you would have to drag Leo;s globe out and find creative way to get rid of the litter without making a mess. While setting up I had to dump clean litter and saw this feature worked perfectly. That's a win for Robot 4.

B. Bigger opening to get in and out - looks like they don't seem to mind jumping in smaller or bigger opening.

C. Waist bin level monitoring - so far it is showing accurate level. Leo's loo does not have that option.

Features which **Leo's loo too** has over Robot 4

UV light  - It is too early to tell how Robot 4 will perform in the smell department , but Leos loo too does not smell at all even with the full bin of waist. It actually smells like an expensive air freshener.  I don't know if it's a UV light that controls the oder so well or/and the design which isolates waist bin from the globe's opening. I mean I could have put it in the kitchen next to the dining table and still be happy with it. I will wait for a month and update this thread on the smell situation for Robot 4.

&#x200B;

Issues so far :

Leo's loo too - none

Robot 4  - as I took that thing out of the box and went through the first few cleaning cycles, I did face an issue with the hard clicking sound. Felt like a mechanical issue with the rotation mechanism. I was laughing that it had to happen on the first day given all the reviews I have read prior to ordering it.

Someone else had the same issue here : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV\_hVTHRw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y5sV_hVTHRw)

So I did some quick research and it ended up being a small issue with the fence causing friction and coming into contact with the plastic piece on the globe while it is rotating during cleaning cycle. I posted my solution here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking\_sound\_when\_rotating\_lr\_4/jcqbxby/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/10pxvcj/clicking_sound_when_rotating_lr_4/jcqbxby/?context=3)

Not sure if it is a positive point, but robot 4 has ton of support discussions online. I feel like most of the issues will be easy to find and resolve them on your own. Not so much for Leo's loot too. I don't think Leo's loo too is just perfect and hence has no wide issues coverage online. It may be just a much newer product.

Missing function on both Robots: Email notification/ SMS

\- My boss made fun of me for buying robot and not scooping the old fashion way. He is usually on my case for buying too many tech gadgets. I only told him about one robot btw. So I have been taking screenshots of push notifications on my cat's bowel movement activity and sending it to him via text message. Wish there was an email/sms solution so I can automate this task.

I will update again in few months."
"Constant issues with LR4 Please helpUpdate- I contacted support through their website because the click here link in the app wasn't clickable... Anyways they replied pretty quick and are sending a replacement base.  

I got the Litter robot 4 about a month ago and at first loved it.  I was hesitant to buy it based on the price but kept reading story after story of how great it is and figured I'd give it a try.  we have 4 cats and the youngest 2 took to it fairly quickly and with the exception of them constantly sticking their heads in when it was cycling causing it pause repeatedly, it seemed to work flawlessly.  

about a week later, all 4 cats have adjusted to it but now we start to have the same issues over and over.  One problem is that it constantly reports full after ever cleaning cycle.  with a fresh liner in place(and they are the LR4 liners) we might get one cleaning cycle where it doesn't report being full but by the second cleaning cycle it's flashing full.  during the day it's not as big a deal to be hitting the cancel button after each cycle, but overnight is always a problem and when we get up in the morning and cycle it, when the litter falls(usually heavy clumps) the unit stops and the light goes solid red.  this has been the second issue that is making me regret this purchase.  you can't cancel the red light like you can when it detects a cat.  the unit becomes frozen and nothing fixes it.  I tried unplugging it for a minute and then plugging back in and it goes through it's initial light sequences and then stops with a half green half red light bar.  ultimately the only way I can get it working again is by removing the bonnet and manually returning the globe to the start position.  I've been doing that multiple times a day and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't paid $700.  

I have researched all the tips and solutions and nothing works more than a day most.  we have it on a hardwood floor, level, not on a rug, not touching any walls.  I have removed the globe and cleaned out any stray litter. I have cleaned the sensors with a dry rag.  I have made sure the liners are on tight and not sticking out where they can get caught.  I also installed the newest firmware this week without any improvement.  I want to love this thing but all I'm feeling is buyer's remorse."
"Firmware questionMy LR4 luckily has had no real issues in the 4 months ish that I have had it . Seeing the non stop posts about issues has me wondering if I should just avoid any software updates since mine is working pretty much flawlessly.

I guess this is more for the litterrobot team but are there any downsides of me not doing software updates ? Will there come a time when the jump between versions is too big and will cause issues ? Currently it performs as advertised so I‚Äôm reluctant to do any upgrades.

Currently on;

"Designed by Dog owners. Tested by humans. Intended for Cats.  

**The Litter Robot 4**

*Designed by Dog owners.* *Tested by humans.* *Intended for Cats.*

Things I have learned while owning my Litter Robot 4.

Getting it out of the box it came in was a chore. The hood kept popping loose. I would think the hood would be better connected to the rim. My very first impression was how cheap it seemed that the hood wasn‚Äôt firmly connected to the rest of the machine. I had the sinking feeling that I had just spent $700 on a piece of cheap plastic.

After unpacking the Robot and placing it near the old litter box, I started to use the android app. The very first thing the app asks for is for me to scan the Q code. I thought, ‚ÄòWell, this sucks. The code is on the back of the Robot and at the bottom. Now I have to turn it around, tilt it up with one hand and try to scan the code with my other hand. Whose bright idea was it to put the Q code in the most inaccessible location?‚Äô I finally gave up and just scanned the code on the box it came in. 

I buy litter in a box so filling the Robot from the box was a no-go. The box was too big to fit into the opening of the Robot. I had to find a scoop and cut open the whole top of the box the litter came in and scoop the litter into the Robot. I guess the Robot designers think everyone buys litter in a small 5-pound bag. 

So, the Robot is in place, the app is set up and it has the right amount of litter. I put a small amount of litter from the old box into the Robot so the cats would get the idea that this is another place/new place for them to go. Now the cats, being cats, begin to investigate this new thing in their world. 

My younger cat (just a few months old) seems to be having fun jumping in and out of the Robot. This causes the Robot to go nuts because its sensors keep detecting an interruption. So, I spend half the day pressing the Reset button on the cowling of the Robot. Of course, this would have been MUCH easier if the app had a Reset button. But hey, I guess the designers were dog owners.

Both cats easily adapted to using the Robot. However, like before, they were fascinated by the motion and no matter which setting I put the Robot on, they kept interrupting the cycle. I spend a lot of my time getting up, walking over to the Robot and pressing the Reset button over and over again to get it to the proper setting.

I actually caught both my cats looking at the Robot, then one would go in and use it, then jump out and they both waited for it to cycle, and then they put their paws on the step and stuck their heads inside. Again, causing an interrupt. This happened every single time they used the Robot. It seemed like they were playing a game with the Robot. Jump in, poop or pee, jump out, wait for it to move then stick their head inside and it stops. Wow! What fun!

This would not have been a big deal if the idiots that designed the app had put a reset button on the app. But nooooo. I had to get up every five minutes, walk over to the Robot and press the Reset button repeatedly to get it back to the proper position. Now I‚Äôm beginning to think that I just got scammed into spending a ton of money on a cat toy.

At this point, I should probably point out that I‚Äôm a Senior with mobility problems so walking is difficult. Getting up every time my cats interrupt the Robot‚Äôs cleaning cycle is a real pain. Literally.  It hurts when I walk so it is a literal pain to have to constantly have to get up and go press the Reset button on the Robot. Boy, the simple solution would have been to just put a damn Reset button on the app. But I guess the geniuses that designed the Robot are dog owners.

About the only thing good about the Litter Robot 4 so far is that I only have to empty the bag that traps the waste instead of scooping my old box. Which is better. I guess. But I only scooped the old box once a day. Now I have to get up and walk over to the Robot every 5-10 minutes and press the Reset button. And, I‚Äôm out $700 bucks.

Time will tell if my cats loose interest in the movement of the Robot and stop interrupting the cleaning cycle. If that happens, I can see where the Robot could work as advertised. And boy do they advertise. Looks like most of that $700 cost is spent on advertising.

I‚Äôm no design engineer. I‚Äôm just an old hippie with mobility problems and two cats that I love. The concept of a self-cleaning litter box is great. It‚Äôs just too bad that this one wasn‚Äôt designed and tested by cat owners. There is a very obvious problem with the sensors and how they control the Robot. The sensors are WAY too sensitive. And the reset function should reset the cycle to its default position with one press of the button. Not multiple presses of the button.

It‚Äôs painfully obvious that there should be a reset button on the android app. An even better solution would be to replicate the five buttons on the Robot cowling in the app. All the other info the app provides is cool, but it lacks true functionality that could help the user. The app is basically all sizzle and no steak.

Maybe it would help if I understood exactly how the Robot worked. Like where exactly are the sensors? On the step or inside the Robot? If the sensors are on the step, that‚Äôs a stupid place because the cats can interrupt the cycle just by putting their paws on the step to see what‚Äôs happening. If the sensors are inside the Robot, then they should only activate if a cat is detected for a longer period of time. That would eliminate the ‚Äòcurious cat‚Äô cycle interruptions.

If the sensors are in both the step and inside the Robot, then the sensors on the step should only be for detecting the cat‚Äôs weight and have nothing to do with the actual cleaning cycle. If the purpose of the ‚Äòinterrupt‚Äô in the cycle is to prevent injury to the cat, that‚Äôs silly because I assure you that as soon as the Robot starts turning they will jump out. A cat would never just sit there and take a ride. A dog might, but never a cat.

Speaking of the Reset function, it should perform a COMPLETE reset with one push of the button. Every time I have had to use the Reset button, I had to press it multiple times to get it back to its starting position. Why? One would think that a Reset button would *actually re-set* the Robot to its starting position. Not to mention that when I have to use the Reset button, my cats come running to watch the Robot do its thing. This often causes another interruption, which requires another press of the Reset button. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.

Overall, I‚Äôd have to say the advertising for the Litter Robot presents you with a fairy tale. The manufacturer wants you to think that you just plop this thing on the floor and magically your cats will use it the way the designers intended. This is false advertising and anyone that buys one of these things will probably agree that it was designed by dog owners, tested by humans and intended for cats. That‚Äôs a scary thought.

All of this is too bad since a good, well thought-out self-cleaning letter box would be a great invention for both cats and cat owners. You would think that if humans could work out how to go to the moon and back safely, we could crack the self-cleaning litter box dilemma. Too bad cat owners can‚Äôt design, build and test one using their own cats. I‚Äôm sure that together, they could figure it out.

Whiskers Support tried to update the firmware in my Robot to reduce the false interrupt problems but they couldn‚Äôt do it remotely. So, they are shipping me a new base which I will have to install myself. Can‚Äôt wait for that journey. We‚Äôll see if I can do it and how difficult it will be. Then there‚Äôs the whole process of boxing up the old base and dealing with a FedEx pickup. Oh joy."
Performed a reset and now the cycle light stays on always‚Ä¶. Any ideas what could cause this ?
"Yet another LR4 disappointmentI have had nothing but trouble with my Litter Robot 4 since it arrived. I was super excited about this product, and after a little less than two months I have found myself thoroughly frustrated with it and will be returning it. The two main issues I am having:

\- It always gets stuck in the cleaning cycle, and manual intervention is needed daily. I have followed the troubleshooting guide and all advice I could find with no improvement in functionality.

\- Pee pools in the tray area as well as inside the base/under globe area.

I spend more time troubleshooting and cleaning the LR4 daily than I did cleaning a traditional litter box. What pushed me over the limit was it getting stuck while I had a catsitter recently - she followed all my advice and looked up troubleshooting techniques on her own, and still could not get it to complete a cycle. She had to go out and buy a traditional litter box instead. 

I'm honestly baffled that \~$700 product is sold with potential for such poor functionality. Yes, there are many people who have functioning units and I wish that I had the experience those people, however the amount of people who have faulty ones or have to spend their time cleaning or troubleshooting their LRs just so it performs its basic functions is ridiculous.

I have initiated the return process and have ordered a roll-over style litter-box instead."
"Want to love this so much, but totally frustrated and unsure how to proceed from here - Litter Robot 4We bought the litter robot 4 and waited a few months for its delivery (it arrived ~September 10 2022).  Initially we had a few hiccups with cycles completing, but all were solved with wiping the sensors and/or resetting by unplugging it. 

Now, we are at errors listed as a motor fault and/or torque error that are not solved by resetting nor solved by performing the maintenance recommended by the litter robot website. Our litter robot will not cycle at all anymore. 

We are at our wits end as the holidays approach and we don‚Äôt have a litter solution at all. I‚Äôm back to scooping litter daily with no end in sight. Does anybody have any suggestions? I can upload a video if needed."
"Release notes for LR4 new firmware that came in the last few days?Hi, I noticed today there is new firmware waiting for my LR4.  Here is a screenshot from my app showing my current versions of my equipment.

I always like to know first what the release notes show before I perform the firmware updates.

"LR3 Connect Not Connecting To WiFiAnyone have a model beginning with LR3C0 & been able to connect to the Whiskers app? It was working as expected, but now it is stuck searching for the network connection for 15+ minutes. 

I‚Äôve performed the basic troubleshooting steps. Any advice on what to do? I‚Äôve read online and it seems the only option is to ask support team to send you a wifi upgrade kit. They retail for ~$100, I‚Äôm not eager to spend more money especially since there‚Äôs built in wifi."
"My LR4 review never got published at litter-robot.comTitle: Disappointed, we'll keep it? temporary 2 stars.

10/02/2022 I must state that the unit is not that it doesn't worth it... IT DOESN'T WORTH IT FOR ME, but I also understand that this is not only about the money you invest on it but the convenience of having a constant clean sand for your cats which is a lot more hygienic for them, but also for you as well, removing the burden of keeping it clean by yourself, so... said that, I think there is a lot of people that put all these in weight, and at the end, this unit, good or bad, FOR ME, the brand is actually the best available, and this comment comes from my ACTUAL, LONG and PRIOR researches on the ""best"" units available,... unfortunately, well impressed with LR3, I missed reviews on LR4.  
This is my story... After looking at the operation of LR3 at a friend's home and listening to what amazing it is after one year of use and the well-constructed, thaaaaaat modern, slick and fancy look, I decided to go for it!,.. I thought, they both, Tobbi and Diego (4 YO and 5 Wo) worth it!... and even better... there is a new iteration of it with a bunch of new features with a tag of plus dollars as well of course!... anyways, I got it!  
It just arrived today and I'm incredible exited for it!!!......... :) :) :) :) :)  
First impression!..... Very nice packaging!...  
Aaaaaaad..... THAAAAATS IT!!!....... :( :( :( :(  
Weak, cheap construction and the worst quality control on the process and final product, gaps and uneven surfaces all over the parts' joints/edges.... huuuuugues!!!!, the waste drawer doesn't seal at all with a big gap and uneven edge running all the way along the bottom of it.... (for all of these, video available), I should've gotten a little bit more into reviews before this purchase, which is my way,... I was that impressed with the performance of LR3 though, that I didn't even though it twice..., my bad! ...  
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!...  
S E V E N H U N D R E D D O L L A R S!!!! FOR THIS!!!!...  
It really hurts!... this is not about the money expensed but the sense of being ripped off... I still don't believe it happened to me! For a THAAAAAT well established and THAAAAAT good, reputed business... shame on you!!!!!!  
But there is more!...  
Hidden information!... for the time being since arrival of the unit (several hours now), I have researched on specs not DIRECT available at advertising... and compared to LR3, the internal size of the globe is 2 INCHES shorter in depth, which added to the 1 inch (advertised) in width, leads to a significantly smaller volume for your cat to move around for its businesses, for which you need to take that in consideration for larger cats.... as mine :( :( :(.  
I still have 3 months ahead of me to test the operation of LR4, most likely I'll return it at the end of the home trial... at least, one needs some kind of satisfaction after the ""fiasco"", so I'll use LR4 for the full home trial, then to decide the road to follow, and in the meanwhile, I'll continue closely following up on the operation of the LR3, for which apparently, everybody is very, very satisfied with and while convinced, I think I'll get LR3 latter.  
I'll post an update in some weeks on following the operation of ""my"" LR4 that hopefully will be useful for any person interested on...  
Stars may go lower.? I don't think so after my research on ""reputed"" brands availabe... going the stars up, neither think so. The 2 stars now, account for the 100% satisfaction on operation that I foresee as positive after use in the following weeks, and mostly based on the current operation of the reputed LR3, FOR WHICH I DONT REALLY BELIEVE, the brad is going to put at risk after that many years of building it.... except for ""feel"", as cheap constructed, and ""look"", about those BIG and UNEVEN gaps and joints, and not the operation of the unfortunate LR4, which I insist, anticipate as totally satisfactory... We'll see................... 

12/20/2022 UPDATE

Firstly, 5 stars to customer support, if there was option to add more I would. No questions asked, I just explained my situation in few, jut few words, and they promptly responded offering a replacement unit right away, the only downside was having to wait more than an hour for somebody to pick up the call. The free replacement unit arrived in one week including return of the faulty one at no charge. Up and running again!!!! Just amazing!!!

All explained about the arrival of the first unit above. 

For more than a moth it operated as expected with minor issues mostly related to dust and hair? at the sensors, which I consider totally normal for the type of product and use, this is, litter, hairy family pets and movement, so I focused on 2-3 time a week for a quick cleaning at the sensor with a brush and some dry air, and no big deal, ready to go..... for few more weeks ony... then it stared to get stuck upside down and red leds at control panel, in both manual and automatic operation, the waste way facing the waste drawer, always in the same position, no matter what you do to try to resolve it, which is not that much... cleaning, thorough cleaning, power down and power back up, review for loose screws, reset to factory setting, unboarding (is this an actual english word?), resetting network... then, the worst... unresponsive control panel at any command. Is at this point that I decided to contact customer service; having a $700 DOLLARS unit just sitting there with no use, well, I just gave up and grabbed the phone, which I try to avoid at all cost (no matter the supplier, all of them) because usually they just go by the book, have no practical experience in their products and most of the time, I end up resolving the issues by myself. Case resolved immediately and I'm very satisfied... so far!... 

CONLCUSIONS

I'm industrial Engineer and understand about production process and interactions of elements involved, bothn at technology development and actual production, and there is ALWAYS, always  room for error and faulty products, and that's why there are always WARRANTY linked to your acquisitions as well; no matter how expensive your Lamborghini is, IT MIGHT COME FAULTY... and it's expected that some of us will get it... well, this time it was me... not a Lamobirghini.... I wish!!!!.... just not there yet! . 

THE GOOD

\- One more star.... 3 now.... yeeeeeeeee!

\- Customer service. Thombs up!!!!!!!!!!!!

\- For BETTER or WORSE, and from many comments and reviews I've read for all those automatic litter boxes in the market, MY PERSONAL conclusion is that this is the best brand to stick with. This is an American company and you relay in their LOCAL support, repair and parts availability.... and no, this review is not sponsored, not looking for it, I'm just paying back to the community, that speaking out has led me to get the best products in the market, that's it.

\- Replacement unit a little bit better constructed, internal litter screen better fitted and tighter to the globe by the bottom edge, the faulty unit has it totally loose and never liked passing through some waste to the litter compartment while cycling, the globe lid better fitted as well with a tighter and easier locking/unlocking grasp.

\-  Looks like electronics still at pretty good level.

\- Wider opening to the globe, more comfortable for entering/exiting the globe.

\- Detection sensor for kittens and actual waste in the drawer.

\- Pets weight detection for health follow up.

\- More comprehensive app and app controls.

THE BAD

\- Cheap fabrication materials? Don't know, it could be the reason for contractions at cooling after casting, leading to all those big gaps at part's joints and external-bottom waste drawer unfitting/bad odor sealing, these are unacceptable for a company with this good reputation and expensive products.

\- Smaller internal globe than LR3, even LR3 is small in general, and I'd say, we family pet's owners want the best for our family, right? For the price, I think is possible to provide more comfort... and I also say we're willing to sacrifice some space in favor of them as well! which is not that much actually... when I see Tobi, our eldest at 4 YO, struggling to cover his ""gracias"" as we say in spanish, I just feel sad :( ...

THE UNKNOWN

\- Was the faulty one, just a random AND EXPECTED off in quality control? or it is actually a FLAW in the development of this iteration of the product that may lead to a total crash in the market?... I have read too many reviews and comments about LR4 and from that, I'm not conclusive yet.

\- For the good of my pets, I'll follow up with the operation of the unit and will attempt to continue posting updates."
"Litter Robot 4 Phantom CyclingHi, before I reached out to LR support I wanted to see if the community had a suggestion for my issue. I got a LR4 about a month ago. Worked perfectly for the first 2-3 weeks. More recently it has been detecting a cat and cycling even when nothing happened. Often it will cycle, detect a cat again, cycle again etc.

&#x200B;

I've double checked no objects are touching the litter robot on the outside. Cleaned the sensors at the top of the entrance. Removed and re-attached the bonnet. Power cycled the device and even performed firmware updates. Does anyone else have suggestions before I reach out to support? If it matters here's the firmware version:

&#x200B;

ESP Firmware 1.1.54

PIC Firmware: 10512.2560.2.66

TOF Firmware 4.0.65.4"
"LR4 issues with scale and nightlightI just received my new LR4 yesterday, and I'm mostly thrilled. My cat started using it almost immediately with no encouragement, and it performs its main function of cleaning the litter flawlessly. So far, so good! However, there are two annoying issues that I can't solve:

1. The SmartScale in the app always shows 0.0 lbs. I've tried updating the firmware, power-cycling the unit, and pressing the reset button multiple times. I've seen in another post that the scale doesn't work great on carpet, and yes, my unit is on carpet. I will buy an 18"" circle of wood from Home Depot as suggested. But if that's really the issue, shouldn't it show SOME weight rather than 0? It always shows ""Cat Detected"" in the app history when my cat enters, and it always initiates a cleaning cycle 5 minutes after he exits, so it's definitely detecting a weight change. So why does it consistently show 0.0 lbs? Seems like there's something other than the carpet issue here.

2. I can't get the nightlight to turn on, no matter what I do. I've tried both Auto and On settings in the app, and all three brightness settings (Low, Medium, High) ‚Äî no dice. Am I doing something wrong, or did I receive a bad unit?

Thanks for any insight!"
"New LR4 stuck blinking between red and green on the light bar, not working at all.Hey folks, just recently got the LR4 delivered a couple days ago and it's unfortunately been nothing but issues. When powered on, it will perform the clean cycle per normal but I have already noticed plastic rubbing I'm assuming between the globe and bonnet. The big issue is that the LR4 will not actually work beyond that initial cleaning cycle.

The light bar just perpetually flashes between green and red and I don't even see anything on their support page about what this is supposed to mean. Troubleshooting it myself, I noticed that if I press down on the bonnet with force, it will eventually turn blue and seem to be working but as soon as it detects any movement and turns red, it will either stay red permanently or will eventually start flashing red and green again.

I'm guessing the CATS sensor is busted in mine but was wondering if there were any additional troubleshooting steps I can take while I wait for Whisker to respond. I've already taken the globe out and placed the bonnet back on without it and the red and green flashing persists even then. Seems like I may have gotten a lemon.

Any help would be appreciated.


EDIT: after spending time on the phone with support (who were very patient and cordial), I ended up just asking for a refund. They think it might've been a calibration issue with my carpet, but I wasn't really willing at that point to keep trying. For $650, I was expecting a much better user experience."
"Litter Robot 4 - Litter sticking and clumping to center silicone?Hello!

I've had the LR4 for about 3 weeks now and its fantastic. I have two cats, one normal and one with excessive drinking and urination problems due to early feline leukemia brain damage (both stray kittens I found in my cabbage patch).

Currently, I am using the base litter that comes from Whisker. I tried using the Arm and Hammer Glide litter that came highly recommended on the litter compatibility post, but in my experience it created excessive sticky clumps that adhered to the silicon litter mat in the globe. The 'Whisker' litter performs much better, but I still experience sticking clumps in the very center of the silicone portion. 

Does anyone else experience a similar problem? Any other solutions? Currently, I use 15 minutes as the cycle time and remove the globe for cleaning every two weeks - spot clean every other day roughly.

I should also mention this is my first time using clumping litter so not much experience with the products and their ingredient makeups."
"There's some (blue) light at the end of the tunnel (Review so far)Model: black LR4

Litter: sustainably yours multicat

\#cats: 1

location: bathroom, tile floor

ordered: early july

received: late august

I've been trouble shooting this pretty much since I got it one way or another but I had some confounding variables.

Issue A: Cat had some trouble adjusting to the LR. confounder: I was adjusting him to it at the same time we moved into a new place so that definitely contributed to him taking his sweet time. It took about 3 weeks for him to start using it exclusively.

some things that helped him to adjust were:

\- keeping the litter robot off for the first few weeks, and manually cycling it. Gradually exposing/conditioning him to the cycling (i started by first only cycling it with the door closed, then cycling it with the bathroom door open, graduated to cycling it in front him while giving him some pats and a treat.

\- Dr. Elsey's cat attract  litter additive

\- praising him when I saw him use it (he's a people cat so this works, YMMV)

\- tossing a lumps of pee from his old litter box into the LR

\- not cleaning the old litterbox

&#x200B;

Issue B) a million cat detection alerts/ phantom cycling: updating the firmware did help with this thankfully for the most part. This still does occur multiple times a day but it's dramatically reduced. It was cycling like more than 20x a day before and now maybe it does that 5x.

Cleaning the sensors with compressed air once in a while also helped with this.

I will say that some people in previous posts mentioned that the sensors may be triggered by floor vibrations. I live on the second story of an apartment building facing a fairly busy street so there are plenty of vibrations. Also kinda gross but the apartment I moved into has a few small roachies (hard to avoid them in the area that I live in sadly, despite meticulous cleaning). I've seen them scurry into the sensor port and set it off a few times. So if you have some unwelcome roommates in your own place, they may also contribute to this.

Issue C) Red light of death: again updating the firmware, turning on/off a few times, making sure the robot isn't on a grout line or touching any cabinet or walls has helped remedy this issue. Also I always turn the LR completely off when I refill the litter, clean it, empty the drawer etc. anytime I have to mess with it in anyway it's completely off which has helped keep the red light at bay.

So far this issue seems to have resolved.

&#x200B;

unresolved issues:

\#1) litter level often usually reads at low: confounder is that I suspect that the litter I use is lighter weight. It's kinda annoying but not a huge issue since I can visually see the litter level every day and top off as needed. Still debating on if I should change to another brand that isnt Boxie cuz dass expensive lol.

\#2) there's some odor: especially when it cycles and exposed the waste drawer to the air (understandably). I've added in A&H baking soda deodorizer with minimal improvement. May be due to the type of litter I use also. Regardless I empty the drawer every 3-4 days no matter the fullness and overall the smell is the same or less than a traditional box.

\#3) there was one time when the cycle got interrupted and the globe got stuck halfway thru sifting. I turned it off/on, tried manually triggering the cycle and it seemed jammed. I had to take off the bonnet and jiggle the globe to unjam it and get it going again. Luckily it was on a weekend, when I was home. If this had happened at work (I work long hours), it would've been a problem, and I'm sure I would've came home to some lovely pee on my bed.

HOPING & PRAYING this doesn't happen again especially when I'm at work one day.

&#x200B;

Overall: I'm content and I've been seeing blue bars mostly for the past few weeks.

It was a bit of a rough start, but I've seen improvement in performance, and am hoping future firmware updates will only make things run smoother. I do still feel like I'm figuring things out regarding cycling timing, litter to use, etc but I am a first time LR user.

I wish it didn't have such a steep learning curve, and honestly idk what I would've done without the support from this subreddit. Those things make this purchase sting considering the price tag. It should definitely have many of these kinks ironed out when you pay $600 for a litter box.

I would still recommend this if asked but with full transparency about my issues. If it was good to go out of the box I would sing praises."
"Horrible Technical Support from Litter RobotReceived a 2nd Litter Robot 4 that was not up to the standard of my 1st one. The new one does not look the same and does not perform as well. Took almost an hour to get into a Live Chat with someone and this person disconnects instead of helping me. Beware of buying from this company. This is the screenshot of the chat as well as the Litter Robot 4 I received. The one on the left is my 1st one. The one on the right is the new one I received yesterday.

Edit: Update. After opening a ticket and sending some photos and video proof. They sent me a replacement Litter Robot 4. I had to clean and send the faulty unit back to them. The new unit arrived quickly. It looks like all new units are now matte finish instead of glossy. The light bar on the new one is bright like my 1st unit so that is good. The faulty one had a dim light bar. I can barely see it in the dark. The top cover shape is still irregular and doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly but I can put up with it. Overall I am happy with the replacement. It seem to work better than the other one. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to go through so much effort to get it replaced but at least the company made it right. So thank you to them"
"LR3 cycle wait timeHello, I have two LR3s, and have a cat with IBD. He's doing well but urinates frequently in the same area of the litter bowl. Recently the CATS weight sensor was not working correctly which required that I manually force cleaning cycles when I was near the unit. This allowed the pee to drain and be absorbed by the litter, right now the unit is performing the cleaning cycle before the pee has time to be absorbed and is now sticking to the wall.¬†


Is there a way to increase the cleaning cycle wait time to 1 or 2 hours before cycling?


Thanks¬†"
"LR3 doesn't rotate back after dispense the waste instead keep on going.Hello,

I have LR3 for about a year and a half now. It has been working great until recently. Yesterday, it has an issue of blue light blinking even when drawer is empty/removed. I've done some troubleshoot on it and got it resolved after reset DFI sensor and clean the pinch detector metal contact under the base.

However, today I found out that it has a new issue that have never done it before. I found it rotated upside down with yellow light flashing quickly. I thought it might have been the pinch detector again since I cleaned it the day prior, I checked it just in case and then reboot the unit.

The LR3 starts trying to perform a cycle. Once it reaches to the point where the waste would be dispense into the drawer, it stops like it normally would. However, instead of rotating back to starting position, it kept going forward until there's cracking, and popping in the back where the black key place located then it would stop with flashing yellow light error code.

I'm unable to contact support at this time since it's over the holiday weekend (4th of July) and support is unavailable at this time. I opened ticket with initial issue (blue light blinking), but will update the ticket once tech support contact me.

For the time being, I would like to ask for advice in the group here and see if anyone has any experience similar to mine or if they may have some idea of what may causing the issue or some way to solve the issue.

Additional information/troubleshoot:

\- Pressing Reset twice during cycle process doesn't bring the globe back to normal position. The first Reset press will stop and second will resume then stop with flashing yellow light error.

\- Sometime, it'll cycle through up to the point where it needs to return. It then rotated back for a bit and then stop and rotated toward dispense direction for a second or two then stop with yellow flashing light.

\- I'm unable to bring it to normal position and ready light on. The unit going into cycle as soon as the LR3 is powered up and keep doing the same issue.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance."
"Compatible wood & clumping litter, EU based ?Hi folks! 

Any tips for Litter Robot-compatible pine/wood litters available in Europe? Ideally, in France? 
We're thinking of buying a Litter Robot for our three cats, but finding compatible pine, clumping, ""fine"" enough litter has been a challenge. Would greatly appreciate your suggestions! Thanks!

Edit: for those interested stumbling on this post, I'm going to test out some litters that might be compatible with the robot and report back my findings. Keep in mind that these are tested in a normal litterbox, not with the Litter Robot. I will update with the results once we purchase the robot. 

Test 1: been trying out Real Nature's wheat fibre litter. Pros: smells great, ultra clumping as advertised, super fine, would pass through the sieve. My maine coons seem to love it. Con: this thing doesn't lie - when it clumps, it CLUMPS. Meaning, pee clumps tend to stick to the box. Perhaps in the rotating Litter Robot, gravity would solve this problem and make the clumps fall. Or, it might stick to the robot's walls and be a pain to clean √®_√©

Test 2: Almo Nature. Even finer than the Real Nature one, will perform great through the LR sieve I think. A bit dustier than the Real Nature one. Pro: pee clumps don't stick to the litterbox's walls anymore & are much easier to remove."
"LR3 Base Glider buttonsHow often do these need to be replaced? I assume they're made out of Teflon or a similar, low friction plastic.

Over time, do they become less smooth and add more friction and resistance to the motor when it tries to rotate the globe?

I've had a Litter Robot 3 for many years, but recently my motor sounds like it's straining to rotate the globe. As I consistently put the same amount and same type of litter in my LR3, I don't think the amount of or type of litter is the problem as it hasn't had this problem in the past.

Would replacing the Glider Buttons (which can be ordered from the Whiskers web site) most likely improve the mechanical rotation performance of my unit?"
"Help: Cycle Not Complete - No error but Litter on the sideMy robot has stopped performing the last step in the clean cycle where it gets the litter back to the center.  No errors/lights reported but it finishes the cycle with the litter to the side of the mat instead of the center.  Anyone seen this?  I've taken apart, made sure the black lever is correct, the tabs are in, it's clean, tried reset, etc."
"Sleep mode start time is creeping forward every dayHi everyone,

Our littler robot 3 (connect) is almost brand new, had it almost 2 weeks now and the only issue I‚Äôm having is with the sleep mode. I set it up to begin at 10pm, and the first night it worked fine. The next night I heard it doing a cycle after 10pm and when I checked the app it said sleep mode was on, but beginning at 11pm. Tonight when I looked at the app it said that it was now starting at 12am. 

Is anyone else having this issue? Do I have to set the sleep mode every single day? Seems a bit silly that it won‚Äôt just keep my preferred time!"
"Port-a-PottyMy cats are working to get acclimated to the PeePoopPod.  Which so far, I am quite impressed with. 

I survived an accidental button press, one bag change and an erroneous waste level full message because I didn‚Äôt roll the bag down correctly. 

For the record, I spread smushed the bag down.  I was frustrated because I hit the ‚Äúempty‚Äù button when I meant the ‚Äúcycle‚Äù button and to my absolute horror and shock, all of the litter dumped out into the bin. So you all know, all the waste in the globe filled perfectly into the bin. 

I tried to sift through the litter in the drawer to put the cleaner litter back in but the task was just too much on my sense of self worth, especially during these times. (I am saying this mostly in fun. I think.) 

Therefore, I made lemonade out of lemons and performed the bag change. One of the cats stared at me conveying all the judgment of all the cats in my local area and this sub while I accomplished this task.  I fell apart under the pressure. 

I later closed the door for privacy and was able to finish the job correctly in the judgement free zone I deserve. 

After washing myself up, I had a treat of tea and 2 biscoff cookies. 

Judgement cat immediately checked my work and then went back and brought her friend, Audit cat.  I have a few cycles so it appears I passed or at least did well enough for them. 

I am bad a reading directions at times. I was so excited to rip a few pieces of tape and remove some cardboard from the fully assembled up. I put more work into deciding where to place it. 

Anyways, I am hoping I am as fortunate as those in this sub that this works for my cats and I do not experience malfunctions. I have a cat (audit cat) that can only use a top entry litter box because they straddle the litter box. The smell and clean up was more than once a day and very time consuming and atrocious.

Oh. I observed Judgement cat sprinting away from the LR after using it. It is like they just used a port a potty.  I left it at 3 minutes because if they can‚Äôt handle the smell, neither can I."
"LR3 connect troubleSo I have a original LR3 that I performed the upgrade to the connect module on some time ago. 

I ended up eventually having some sensor issues that I didn't get around to getting sorted until recently, but my LR3 hasn't been online since before the new app.

I'm trying to get it connected back up, and with both the new and old app, they hang around the step where it's validating connectivity. Now, I know it's connected, I can see the association in to my AP, and that it has had traffic in and outbound, and has performed DNS lookups to what I assume is the cloud service they use to process commands. But it just spins and never gets any farther (the app isn't hanging, but it isn't proceeding either). I've done the airplane mode thing, though I don't think that was my issue, as I have auto-connect disabled on my phone to all my local APs, but I tried it anyway with no change in the outcome.

Has anyone else gotten into this situation and resolved it? I've got a ticket in with support, they gave me the standard canned reply, which I followed up with a bunch more information about my network and what I'm seeing but haven't heard back, so I thought I'd ask here too.

My concern right now, I've gathered there was a new firmware issued at some point, and I wonder if I'm in a chicken or egg situation now where I can't connect up without the new firmware, but I can't get the new firmware without connecting up. It sounded like from another post in here that is a possible state. Since I haven't been online with my LR in a long time, it's possible I am in that state.

Anyway, any suggestions appreciated! I'm being lazy and trying to avoid doing a packet capture of the network traffic, but I may be at that step if I can't find any other optioons."
"Good LR litter for long haired catI see lots of post about best litter for the LR. I've been using ever clean since day 1 with the LR and very happy with how it mask smells and performs in the robot. However, we now have our first longer haired cat, and I notice her backside seems to often have bits clumped litter. 

Can anyone recommend something that is less likely to stick to a long hair cat while while working well in the LR and providing odor control?"
Why is my LR4 not respecting 25-minute delay? It seems to stop considering anything past the third weight detection.

"Panel Lockout Seems to Revert to Off.Hi,

We've got a 19 month old and he loves to press the buttons on both the FR and LR. Seems like the Feeder Robot respects the Lockout but, somehow, every few days, the LR reverts back to not being locked out.

The one thing I can think of is that my wife and I have the LR app on our Androids but one or the other will set the panel lockout. It'll work for a random amount of time, and then we'll see him pressing the buttons and it responding.

Is there something I can check as to why this might be happening? 

Thanks."
"Message to CEOMr.  Zuppke,

Thank you for the recent message to your customers. It helps to know that you recognize you have a problem. I think most of your customers like the concept of your product and want to see you succeed. I personally have been a loyal customer for five years. I'm sure, however, that you can sense the level of frustration on this forum.

What would best address that frustration is more frequent, candid communication. The LR4 is undeniably flawed--or, at a minimum, unreliable--and seems to have been released prematurely. You must be working on fixes, but please let us know that. You are advertising heavily and presumably increasing sales while cutting back on customer support. That's not a good optic. It may help you get over short-term hurdles but risks damaging your reputation long-term. Moreover, continuing to send out faulty units will only compound your problem. 

You might be able to reduce returns and even support tickets if you would frequently reassure us that you're working on a solution to specific problems, such as the red bar of death, the frequent loss of WiFi connectivity, the overly sensitive sensors, or the globe getting stuck in an unusable position, to name a few. If some problems are insurmountable, it would be a show of respect to let customers know so that they can make informed decisions. Just communicate. 

Please. I have loved your products, the creative ingenuity of your ideas, and the excellent customer service you had in the past. Please make it all work again."
"Am I 'Reset King' for Phantom Delay Cycles?Now that I own both the LR3 and LR4 -- and am kitty steward to two highly active Bengals -- I'm finding myself trying to head off more and more unwanted phantom LR globe cycles by pressing the respective ""Reset"" button.  For the LR3, it doesn't help that it's near a window and use it to boost themselves up to look out, and for the LR4, just sticking their noses a few inches inside starts a phantom delay cycle.  Of course, in either instance, I'm hoping to save the motor from unnecessary running or premature failure (if it is possible).  


I might do this perhaps a half-dozen times a day.  But in this tongue-in-cheek posting, I was wondering if I should hand my ""Reset King"" crown to another.  What is the extent of your curious or undecisive-at-the-doorstep-kitty experiences?"

"LR3 or LR4 for being out of town?Hi everyone! 

After spending hours in this sub (and elsewhere online), I‚Äôve decided to get a LR. The only question is LR3 or LR4? For a TLDR: feel free to skip to 6 & 7 below.

It seems like a gamble either way. And I‚Äôm willing to take that gamble at this point, but I would really appreciate users weighing in on which one they think is (or, even better, experience as) more likely to be less buggy. I know this is just getting anecdotal evidence, and the amount of variables in each report arguably make this ask counterproductive, but I‚Äôm asking nonetheless lol

The person I had lined up to handle my cat‚Äôs litter had to bail, so I‚Äôve gotta take the pricey plunge before my 10 day trip next month (Don‚Äôt worry, my cat won‚Äôt be alone! She lives with a bunch of people who have no problem feeding/watering/interacting with her. I just don‚Äôt want them to have to deal with her litter.) 

Some takeaways I‚Äôve gathered from my research:
1) Both LR3 & LR4 have their issues, and it‚Äôs ordinary to replace parts or entire units if necessary. That seems kind of like it‚Äôs part of the experience (which is not great for such an expensive product).
2) Fortunately, Whisker‚Äôs customer service is solid. 
3) Gradual acclimation and patience are likely necessary to train the transition. Including not letting a skittish kitty see cycling until she‚Äôs comfortable enough to use it. 
4) Proper maintenance goes a long way. 
5) Smart switches are not recommended by Whisker, but users report positive experiences with them in case of needing to manually power cycle while away. 

6) LR4‚Äôs waste tray has a slightly bigger capacity and is quieter, which is why I‚Äôm leaning toward it. 

I‚Äôm not sure about this one, but
7) LR3 has maybe had more time on the market to be less buggy than LR4?

I know there are a lot of LR3 vs. LR4 threads, but this one is meant to be geared toward the prospective buyer who‚Äôs gonna be out of town, and wants to take their best shot at the dang thing just working. Sincerely, thank you in advance!

Btw I‚Äôll gladly use anyone‚Äôs referral, especially if it comes with a helpful comment!"
"Looking for a LR - need advicesI never had the LR. Just waited to pull the trigger for too long. Prior experience with electronics taught me that top of the line is usually not the best. So I have a few questions: 
- for a newbie, what model would you recommend? Most reliable? Easy to setup and use? The easiest one? 
- I don‚Äôt need it to work with Alexa or wi-fi unless it is a must. Comcast is sketchy in our area. The fewer setups, the better. Need an easy thing which would fit into out toilet and not scare the cat. She is small-medium, 6 years of age. 
- is Amazon a good source? Usually it is OK except for cosmetics.
- for the first buy, besides the LR itself, do I need to buy something else? 

Any advise would be sincerely appreciated."
"LR4 liner holes after less than 2 monthsI‚Äôve seen a few comments in LR FB groups and on here regarding the LR4 liner developing holes, and I unfortunately am seeing the same thing after less than 2 months. 

 Some background: we have 3 cats, none of which are big ‚Äú diggers‚Äù and don‚Äôt excessively scratch at the robots. We have had a LR3 as the only litter box for the 3 cats , for 2 years and the liner is unscathed! 

Yesterday As I was dumping the kicked-out litter back into the LR4 ( a sometimes daily occurrence ‚Ä¶ highly recommend using a dog crate tray to catch that if mats aren‚Äôt sufficient for you ), I noticed a hole in the liner right where the litter sits and another one on the side! I will admit that I thought maybe others who were experiencing the liners deterioration maybe had cats that messed with it / excessively dig/ bite the liner ‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt seem to always be the case, because my 3 don‚Äôt do those things. . .Kick litter out of it for fun and to torment me ? Yes, absolutely‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs the extent. 

 I reached out to whisker and sent photos and they initially said they‚Äôd send me a new liner, but then said they don‚Äôt have installation videos yet, so they‚Äôd be sending me a whole new unit and I‚Äôll send this one back ‚Ä¶ to be fair , I would be fine with written direction for installation, but this may just be easier for them right now , having units boxed and ready to go and not a surplus of pieces. 
 I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre resolving my issue , but I‚Äôm concerned now that I‚Äôll be doing this again in a couple months. Not only that, but now I feel like I need to inspect this robot more often to make sure it‚Äôs intact, and that shouldn‚Äôt be the experience for something advertised to make being a cat owner ‚Äú easier‚Äù. 
 I sincerely hope they are working on a solution for the liners in the 4, it‚Äôs clear that this is a fairly common issue already and it‚Äôs disappointing that this wasn‚Äôt corrected while they were being beta tested. I can‚Äôt imagine it being cost effective to ship replacement units out to folks constantly."
"Secret hiding spot for everything gross‚Ä¶While doing some deeeeep deep cleaning of my 1.5 year old LR3 I discovered a secret hiding spot in the globe where everything gross exists.

It‚Äôs on the top of the globe near the opening for the litter to come out and underneath the grate that stores the litter when cleaning. If you pull back the grate plastic (which is extremely hard to do) you will find some foam around the inside of the litter opening and in my case I found gobs of caked on litter goo. üò≥ No wonder people complain about the smell even after cleaning!

Any suggestions on how to clean this? The plastic grate doesn‚Äôt seem to be removable so I have no idea how I would get to it. Maybe removing the liner?

I audibly gasped when I found this hiding spot and don‚Äôt know how to proceed. Any suggestions?!

"Poop Diaries: Struggles of Rick James The Ragdoll vs LR3**TL/DR** \- bigger cat poops outside LR3, never did with LR2, I tried buying the steps bc i thought it was joint related, i tried multiple different brands of clumping clay. No dice. I think the angular division of space inside the box creates a different slope on roof and bottom of globe which makes it easier for paws to get stuck in wet clay. Cats don't want to step in their pee and poo. Have purchased Fence accessory, will try to see if it helps and update this thread. Would love it if Litter Robot and Whiskas could really show up for loyal customers and offer to exchange these for the LR4. It's the right thing to do for some of us.

**UPDATE 2:** we've been giving it a shot for a while, and he still ends up pooping outside of the box every once in a while. At this point, I would simply say, if you have a bigger cat in terms of 20 lbs and up, and I mean big as in SIZE not a big belly lol, I CANNOT recommend LR3 for the exact reasons I've mentioned in this exhaustive look at the physics of the device. Your cat might be big and might use it, but there is a high probability that it wont be comfortable for them, and when you think what percentage of a cat's life the bathroom visit takes up, it's just not right. Hopefully the LR4 will deal with this issue. I can already tell they've improved the aspects that I think are failures in the design change of the LR3. Unfortunately I will not be able to grab one as the pricing becomes more prohibitive with every new release of this robot. But you don't have to be me. 

**UPDATE:** so I installed the fence, and so far for the past 2 days we have not had any fehicular mishaps outside of the LR3. I will continue to observe and will be back in about a months time to give another update. I'm only doing this to help ppl out. I just want to mention again that the design of the globe is the actual problem here.

I went from the litter robot 2 (and both of my cats using it fine for 11 years replaced some parts on it though) to the litter robot 3 last year. I have a black short hair, and a large Rag doll, the Ragdoll stopped pooping in the LR3 and poops right in front of it. So let me run you down what I did and my process real quick:

\- First, I thought maybe it was a joint issue. He's getting older and this litter is at a bit of a weird angle and the step is designed very differently, so I bought the steps. Seemed to kind of do the trick for a little while, but not really. Strike 1

\- Then, I started noticing that he'd have litter stuck on his back paws (he uses the litter box backwards and poops and pees near the entrance. The stuck litter issue, never ever occurred on the LR2. I thought, okay it's the litter I'm using maybe? Switched litter 3 or 4 different types of EXPENSIVE Boxit, and cheaper clumping clay. No difference really except he doesn't get it stuck in his paws as much anymore (I'm guessing this is due to him pooping outside the box though lol)

\- Finally, I'm where I am today, and I honestly have very little belief this will make a difference, but I've bought the ""fence"" accessory and will be applying it as soon as it comes in the mail.

My thought process through all of this is that he's a big boy. Like a 24 pound fuzzy big boy. There has to be something going on with the internal geometry of the Litter Robot 3 that wasn't going on in the Litter Robot 2. I can tell you that the way the top of the rotating ball is designed is different enough in combination with what feels like some sort of measured difference in the way the bottom of the ball is designed. Clumps stick more, and clumps track more across the top of the ball. That's just the truth of it. Hate it or love it. It was NOT a problem in the LR2. I think the angular difference in the roof and the bottom creates a situation where pee spreads out more (which would normally be a good thing) but makes it more difficult for bigger cats to maneuver in a way that keeps their paws out of the wet clay. Also if you were a previous owner of the LR2 you'll notice that the LR3 globe is mounted at an upward angle of like 35 degrees, more or less, where as the LR2 was parallel to the ground. ***It'd be nice if Whiskas could release some sort of contraption to adjust the angle of the globes if we want to so that they are, much like their previous design, parallel to the ground.***

Personally, as a really really long time lover and customer of this product, I'd be ecstatic to be on their team and try out the LR4. I'd be happy to do an exchange for it with them. I'd be over the moon to be honest because I think they know what mistakes they made and it looks like they've purposely improved on them. But I sincerely doubt they'd do anything like that for me or my kitts. They're just so expensive to buy, it's prohibitive to upgrade for me after I spent money on one just last year. Especially in Canadian rupee. It saddens me because my dudes are senior citizens now, and I want them to keep living their best lives. I can't get mad at my buddy when he poops outside the box, he's not doing it to piss me off he's really self-conscious about it and knows it's not good, but it's not his fault. *It's my fault, and to be honest, it's* ***Litter Robot*** *and now* ***Whiskas*** *fault* as well and that's exactly why they've made the mouth of their LR4 so much bigger, in order to give bigger cats the ability to navigate better in the ball/globe. **I will update this when I get to test out the fence**. My idea is that it will allow homie to feel where he's at because of the higher ridge, and allow him to be more precise about not stepping in the wet clay spot. It's a pipe dream, and these additions have defo cost me money. It is what it is. They're family. Ya'll know that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PS: Just want to add that I NEVER do things like this. I NEVER write these kinds of epic (need 100 hours to read) reviews and I always blame myself for buying bunk products. I actually really do believe this could help a potential owner make a better decision about this product though, and I never see anything highlighted anywhere that mentions this in full detail for people to understand that it is not a one-off experience and will happen to your kitt if he/she is a similar build. This is a purpose built apparatus for cat defecation, and it costs around $800 with tax.

"Review - Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount - 2 Months of Use**Introduction: Whisker Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount**

The Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is an innovative accessory designed to enhance the functionality of the Litter Robot 4 by allowing users to monitor their pet's activity more closely.

I‚Äôve been using the new Whisker camera mount for about 2 months, and in this product review, we will evaluate the camera mount's features, focusing on its ease of installation, compatibility concerns, and any potential improvements.

https://preview.redd.it/30fm1qy0fl1b1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=907690c65b697907406400f2d0c16a1c3a8a7d87

**Ease of Installation: A Major Plus**

One of the highlights of the Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is its user-friendly installation process. The mount is designed with a snap-in mechanism similar to the included fence of the Litter Robot 4, which ensures a secure fit without requiring additional tools or equipment.

It has a cover to hide any exposed wires from being played with or chewed at by your furry friend.

The original mount that came with the camera would trip the light sensors on the Litter Robot 4; causing it to not turn on the night light automatically in the dark.

(Likely due to picking up the infrared light from the cameras night vision as found below).

https://preview.redd.it/ctkh5predl1b1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f7f8c27ab4a2273374864c31ef2f1b9e9deae04

However the new camera mount accessory resolves these issues; I am able to position the camera in more positions to find one without causing a ""light bleed"" issue.

This is great since I can have the camera night vision on, as well as litter robot 4 automatic night light.

**Camera Compatibility: Just Double check!**

The Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is currently designed to work with cameras featuring magnetic mounts or tripod mounts.

However, it does not include any clip-ins or ball joint attachments for cameras that utilize those types of mounting methods, my Eufy Indoor C24 camera I use which actually utilize both these methods so I was mostly out of luck. (So, I thought?)

I could have used the magnetic attachment; the Eufy does have a metal bracket on the bottom for this, but it didn‚Äôt feel as secure as I would have liked. I knew the cats would easily pull it down due to the weight of the camera.

https://preview.redd.it/ydx9aedecl1b1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbce97e04c9ee91771b898896c9ef20dc596adfb

(Camera mounting clips in red below for reference)

**Solution!** After about 30 minutes, I managed to get the camera installed securely without the magnet by taking it apart further than a regular user might be comfortable doing as found below:

https://preview.redd.it/ydugzolfcl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3baeb6e747a0f42aebe0852b27401c715df4fba8

**Summary of steps include:**

&#x200B;

1. Remove the SD card, if you have one installed. This is important! If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll damage the      camera.
2. Open the case. There‚Äôs a small recessed area at the bottom of the camera between the black camera face and the white base. Pry gently with a screwdriver or a sludger.
3. Once you have the front part open, carefully remove the braided red and black speaker wire from the camera board.
4. Unscrew the stand from the case. It‚Äôs secured by one small screw. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be left      with; my case I decided to paint the stand black while I was here, but usually it would be white.

Once I had access to the ball joint, I removed it from the stand and fed it through the hole on the new LT4 mount, and then screwed it back into the camera assembly, giving it a tight fit to the mount without any play.

https://preview.redd.it/kfz9afmjcl1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dad8600034270cf3316e3065730a84c02479457f

To accommodate a wider variety of cameras and consumer preferences, the recommendation for Whisker should be to consider possibility including more camera attachments for the mount.

However I realize they need more user feedback as they can‚Äôt possibly test all the cameras on the market. The current solution using magnets and the standard for tripod camera mounts is a great start.

**Designated Camera Angles: Perfect**

The Litter Robot 4 camera mount provides a set number of designated camera angles, enabling users to monitor their pet's activity during the self-cleaning process.

The current design currently have 4 fixed points on each side for camera angles, one important note is that if you remove the arm, flip it over, and snap it back on, it actually has slightly different positions. The intention was to get 8 usable positions.

https://preview.redd.it/05zngonkcl1b1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=117559f1278ba9ea13af61cbf8e09c3269027426

**Below are just some of the different camera angles asides from my choice at the start, and their viewpoints I think people might find useful:**

**Conclusion:**

The Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount is a promising accessory that adds value to the Litter Robot 4 experience. It solves light bleed issues with the Litter Robot 4 night light sensors.

Its ease of installation, facilitated by the snap-in mechanism, is a standout feature that makes it an attractive option for pet owners looking to enhance their monitoring capabilities.

Overall, the Litter Robot 4 Camera Mount shows promise, but enhancements in camera compatibility with extra attachments available could propel it even more.

As this is an early review, it is important to keep in mind that Whisker may address these concerns in future product updates."
"Those of you who have a camera on your LR4: what kind?My LR4 has been in service about 6 weeks, and of my three cats, as far as I can tell: the 16-year-old took a month or so but now has taken to it fine, the 14-year-old has used it twice, and the 15-year-old is still eyeing it like it might eat her. (TBF, she eyes everything like it might eat her.) She's a mostly-rehabilitated semi-feral, very anxious, and I genuinely am not sure how much she currently weighs, since I can't pick her up long enough to weigh her and she's shorter but plumper than the others.

So, I thought if I put a camera on the LR, as I've seen others do, I could at least be certain who is and isn't using it, as opposed to just having a strong suspicion. But, I've read that some of the cameras can interfere with cycling because of IR. Those of you who have a camera working well to monitor use of your LR, could you let me know what brand and model? Did you have to do anything special with setup or placement or the like? Thank you!"
"Hands down the worst customer service I've ever seen2 weeks ago I started having issues with my litter robot 4. I bought it a few months ago and have been experiencing the globe getting stuck and showing a half green, half flashing red bar on it. I made a post and after trying nearly everything I continued having the issue. I made a support ticket as some people advised, however whiskers customer support is extremely disappointing for an almost $1000 product. Whisker not only never responded to my support ticket, but commented on my post telling me to DM them only for them to open the chat and never respond. I love the product but genuinely can't get over how much of a joke the customer support is."
"New litter robot owner with some questions/concernsI'm a new Litter Robot 4 owner with a few questions/concerns. To start, I know there's a reputation in the sub for negativity (which to me is fair for $800 litterboxes that come with defects and errors), but I want to mention that my partner and I love the benefits of these boxes enough that we're genuinely trying to work through the problems we've been experiencing in our first week to make these fixtures in our lives.

1. One of our units drops wifi. I've tried looking to see what people do for this issue, but have had mixed results. For the people that have had this issue and had it resolved, what did you do? Did Whisker help? My first conversation with Whisker was pretty annoying; the person kept explaining that it simply had to be my internet (everything else but the litter box, including the other Litter Robot, works perfectly on it) or that I ""should move the litter robot next to my router"". Bad answer for the expensive product that drops wifi constantly.

2. We just found today that the other Litter Robot we got had a piece of plastic underneath the bin hanging off. I'm very gentle with expensive electronics and we have had this for under a week (for reference we've emptied a 90% full bin once); I know I did not do anything to break an ostensibly sturdy piece of plastic off. I think it had a hairline fracture either from the factory or during shipment. Does anyone have experience with this happening? Would they ship a big piece of plastic for me to install or would they want the whole unit sent back?

Again, I want to make these work. As egregious as I think these issues in week 1 are, the cats love the boxes and we love the basic functionality. If I can get these resolved, I think they'd be A+ products. But based on the sounds of things, Whisker definitely has a quality control problem. Any help is appreciated!

(Reference photo of the broken plastic in the comments)"
"LR4 ‚Äì Cat is hanging his butt just outside and pooping on the fenceHe's a big boy, about 14lbs, and after two days of using it, he's started hanging his butt just over the fence and pooping on top of it. He did this with a tidy cat litter system too and the _only_ thing I could do was use cardboard to make a really tall border to force him to keep his butt inside the box, but that doesn't seem physically possible with the LR4. 

So it's just over right? he's clearly trying to say he hates it? Which really makes me think this cat is hopeless, he does this with virtually any litter system I get, it's like he genuinely _wants_ to poop right outside the box."
"Anyone happy with the LR4?So many posts about LR4 issues here lately, but of course people tend to post more when they have a complaint vs something positive. 

Anyone here genuinely happy with their LR4? 

I have two LR3s and it‚Äôs been fine, no major issues and it‚Äôs been about 18 months since I got the 1st one, about a year since I got the 2nd. I would like to upgrade to the most recent model eventually."

"Do not hesitate to contact customer support - they actually want to helpI've had my LR3 connect for 23 or 24 months now. I bought the extended warranty. 

I've had issues with it since the beginning. I was so terribly disappointed with the amount of money spent on this machine. It was extremely finicky. Every error code / app notification - I've had at some point. I called customer service maybe a year or so ago. They managed to walk me through the bonnet removed error (bend tabs, clean connections) and it helped for awhile but I was still clearing errors at least weekly. New errors happened every few weeks. I was either on here or youtube or google every few weeks trying to figure out the errors. 

However in the last month or so, the thing is basically useless to me. It was repeatedly getting stuck upside down daily with yellow flashing lights. I have to manually reset it daily. I sent an e-mail to customer service to complain about this machine a week or so ago after cleaning up cat mess for the umpteenth time because the machine got stuck. They asked for pictures, explanations, etc. I provided all of it.  My app also tracked my errors, so I could reference exactly what was repeatedly happening. I wonder if they checked my app history log or something.  

They also made specific recommendations about the types of litter to use. Globe lift problems. Unclean machines causing weight / balance issues. The detailed help and troubleshooting I received was thorough, but ultimately didn't fix my issues.

I thought since I'm outside of warranty, they would maybe send a new base or bonnet at my expense. Maybe new sensors so I could replace them. 

They're sending a whole new unit.    Ôºà‚óé0‚óéÔºâÍí≥·µíÍí≥·µé·µé·µé

I am genuinely surprised at the level of customer service. Everyone I dealt with seemed like they genuinely wanted to help as well, which was refreshing. Kudos to Litter Robot."
"Pinch detect fault few weeks after replacing pinch connectorHi all - 

Wondering if anyone is getting constant ""pinch detect faults"" from LR 3 Connect? 

I replaced the connector a few weeks ago (with genuine parts from LR) after pinch detect fault-ing for weeks, and once I replaced it, it worked fine... until yesterday after emptying the bottom tray, I started getting this message again. I have tried: re-aligning the bag, opening the unit up and cleaning for any debris, opening the bottom to re-position the connectors... all to no solution.

Now I'm wondering if I need to replace the motherboard for the pinch connectors entirely, or if it's just  an issue with the pinch connectors.

I've had the LR 3 Connect for about 2.5 years now, and constantly live in fear that the pinch connector will malfunction (lol). Anyone have tips/tricks on how to avoid the pinch detect fault scaries?

LR is a life changer, but I also am getting a bit tired of the pinch detect faults, and wondering if there are any other alternatives out there :("
"Litter Robot 3‚Ä¶the smell is unbearableI just bought a used litter robot 3 from a cat shelter for my new stray that i recently took in. Took it home it home and cleaned it and so far my cat loves it. The problem is, the litter tray smells horrible. I know its the litter tray because when it started smelling bad yesterday i took the entire thing apart and cleaned all of the insides as well as the dome and it smelled great. Fast forward to today, which my cat has used it 3 times now, and it smells terrible again. Does anyone else have this issue? I‚Äôm not sure what to do but i feel cheated after spending $300 on it just for it to stink after a days‚Äô worth of use.

*I also already replaced the carbon filter and am using LR-3 bags that I purchased off of amazon.*"

"Acclimation training in progress!2 years ago, u/DefNotAShark posted a comprehensive account of what worked for him to acclimate his scared cat. I followed it closely, although my cat isn‚Äôt as affection motivated as his. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a look to any new user. Both he and I had immediate success by physically placing our cats into old school litter boxes years ago. Both of us did the same with LR (though, admittedly, I did so much less aggressively because my cat doesn‚Äôt love being held as much as his). I also used a mixture of Dr. Elsey‚Äôs cat attract litter with her usual (Fresh Step w/ Febreze).

My LR4 arrived on Sunday, and today on Friday (Day 5), I have documented success! This feels like a huge victory because my 5 year old girl is highly skittish and can be resistant to change. She‚Äôs actually been using it for about two days (maybe 3?) now. 

I was paranoid that she wasn‚Äôt using it because I‚Äôve caught myself being absentminded and distracted during the last week, and I somehow convinced myself that the waste in it could have just been the few clumps I added from her old litter box, even though those clumps were clearly not in the same position as I‚Äôd left them ü§£. To stake her out and be sure, I was able to repurpose an old smartphone into a fully functional pet cam. (Shout-out to Alfred Home Security app, which is an outstanding free app!)

Next phase will be letting her see it run a cycle. Gonna keep cycling it whenever she‚Äôs not around for at least the next week or two. Maybe more. Terrified she‚Äôs gonna lose trust in it once she sees it move. On several levels: can‚Äôt afford to lose that sweet sweet progress! 

Posting this was one part ‚Äúsuccess story in progress‚Äù, one part ‚Äútips for new users‚Äù, and one part self-serving ‚Äúkeeping my own morale up.‚Äù üòÇ"
Cannot Resolve this LED codeThe litter robot 4 just had its base replaced and still the same error persists with 3 solid white LEDs and 2 flashing yellow. It seems the motor attempts to move but it doesnt budge. The globe is clean and the tract on the back is secure. So it has to be something with this globe then? The most frustrating part is there is no mention of this LED code in the manual or online. Any help much appreciated.
"Help with securing the fence on the LR4My boy cat loves to sit in the LR, and scratch at the fence for extended periods of time, from the outside in.  Twice now, he's managed to dislodge the fence so that it goes into the LR, to be deposited in the bin, both fouling the fence, as well as making the LR believe that the bin is full.  Any tips on making sure the fence is better secured so that it's harder for him to dislodge?    


Leaving it off is not an option, as both he and his sister are really good at making sure there's an equal amount of litter outside the bot as in, when there's no fence in place."
"Litter Robot 4 + Eufy CameraTitle explains it all.

Hooked up a Eufy Indoor camera to the USB port of the LR4 and it looks and works great. 

It's easily detachable and works with infrared at night, allows audio passthrough and it record locally to the SD card.

Some Eufy cameras have had a bit of a bad press recently, so I repurposed this one for the litter Robot seeing this isn't security sensitive stuff, and it works great!

Attached photos of it in action, I just wish the Eufy camera was black, or I had opted for the White litter box. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Oh well. Whisker if your listening make sure to make your camera in 2 colors!"
"Struggling to acclimateI‚Äôve had the LR4 for ~2 weeks now. The cats have used it once to urinate in the very beginning and have not touched it sense. I‚Äôve kept the old litter boxes (though not cleaned them) out of fear that if I remove them that they‚Äôll start toileting on the floor. 

Here‚Äôs a rough timeline: 
- day 1: set up LR4 in new area of the apt with fresh litter. 
- day 2-6: waste tray had one clump of urine 
- day 7: added litter from the old boxes (without excrement) to the LR4 
- day 8-14: will get notifications that the sensor is going off, though on video (we have a security cam) they put half their body in, sniff around, step out, and then sit and watch till it completes a cycle. 
- day 17 (today): added much more old litter and moved the LR4 to where the original boxes were. Moved the original boxes to where the LR4 was. Sprinkled some catnip around the general LR4 area. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm really wanting this to work. I‚Äôm thinking my next shot would be changing the timer from every 7min to every 15min to reduce the cycles and hopefully they associate the LR4 less as a toy and more like a litter box. 

Any other suggestions or tips?"
"Flashing Red and Green Light and Unable to Connect Device to AppI've had the Litter Robot 4 for less than a week. It was working perfectly until 2 days ago when I changed the waste tray. I'm not sure what happened exactly, but the unit is flashing green then red lights. I've researched what I can find on Reddit and the web, but non of the troubleshooting has resolved the issue. Thankfully, the unit still cycles after it's been used.

Details:

The unit has been on hardwood floor since I've had it. I've made sure the feet were clean and moved it to another part of my house. Green and Red lights are still there. 

Per the support center, I tried adding weight to the bottom tray and then reset it, but that also didn't clear the lights.

There are 2 connectors near tray, one for power, and the other for the weight sensors(I think) They're both firmly secured. 

&#x200B;

I also haven't been able to connect the device to the app. I follow the prompts and it says it's successful, but the device doesn't appear in the app. I made sure to connect the device to a 2.4 wifi signal.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any other troubleshooting tips? I'm probably going to just exchange the device, but I'm not excited to have another unit from this company."
"Continuous Issues with the LR4Hey all, hoping for some guidance. I had a LR3 for years, and while I did have sporadic issues, they were relatively easy for me to fix myself.

I‚Äôm very much in an ongoing struggle with my LR4 that I received in August. 

Frequently it gets stuck mid cycle, sometimes random glitches other times I realized early on that the fill line measurement for litter is deceiving.

Facts: it‚Äôs on a hard even surface, and I‚Äôm using regular clay litter. It‚Äôs not touching any walls, and the litter is now always a bit below the fill line to accommodate the design flaw.

The problem: over torque issue that I now can‚Äôt get it to work at all:

I‚Äôve tried the following:
-inspected the globe and base unit including seals, filter, and motor for any debris or obstructions. 

-cleaned every part of the base unit and globe 

-checked the ‚Äúwheels‚Äù, globe track, and unit base motor gear, and they‚Äôre all stable/not loose

-separated the liner from the globe and confirmed the counterweight is securely in place 

-made sure all bonnet connection points are aligned every time when trying to get it to cycle

-cleaned all sensors

-updated the firmware 

-obviously powered off/on and unplugged/replugged as well multiple time.

Literally nothing is helping.

I reached out to Whisker support and find they respond in like 3+ days per message/reply with one suggestion, which is irksome because I‚Äôm now using this as a glorified regular litter box for 3 cats that I spent $700 on until it can be fixed. 

Anyone have similar issues that tried something I haven‚Äôt outlined here that helped? 

Any advise is greatly appreciated!"
"I GIVE UP‚Ä¶I have been a multi cat customer since 2015.  Last unit I received in 2019 I believe. 

But as others have said, when working well , they are worth the cost and the 1/2 a room they take up in space.  I found them helpful for me with back issues, easier to change out bag than bend over for 5 minutes to dredge and scoop ‚Äú the old fashioned way‚Äù 

I‚Äôve also owned every other kind of box ever invented before these..

Owned a total of 4 litter robots open air 3‚Äôs with all the accessories and have maintained them meticulously, I still change the bag every day full or not. Use Elseys litter and deep clean every month or so. 

I agree they have all had their quirks and I‚Äôve had to replace, practically everything, and troubleshoot etc over the years. Spent thousands. 

Of course they are all out of Warrenty now. 

Recently one of the bases crapped out and I really needed support. 

, I tried calling and did not know the company changed hands. 

I emailed the ‚Äúsupport ‚Äú team. 
It‚Äôs been over a month. 

I threw out the fucking thing and replaced with the old fashioned scoop litter box. 

Now another is acting up. 

I just discovered this sub and see I have no shot in hell to get support. 

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LITTER ROBOT. 

Here is my assessment:
Biggest concern‚Ä¶ besides the CONSTANT trouble shooting, large Pees stuck to bottom, lights blinking , unit stuck half way around and blinking,to name a few.. 

This technology has actually ‚Äútraumatized ‚Äú my cats as they have gotten older. 

They are fine for young cats but when they become seniors and have mobility or health issues ( that they are trying to hide from other cats) I find the cats are hesitant to use box, circling around, making sure no other cats are watching until their waste spins out. 

1) If your cat has dilute urine from kidney, thyroid or other issues issues, the pee is large and usually sticks to the bottom no matter how much litter and how long you set the timer before spinning. 

This results in having to scrape and clean the rubber lining frequently.
10-15 minutes and replacing litter. 

2)  if your cat is large 15-20 lbs, they really don‚Äôt fit in there comfortably and again, my elderly cat started using the ‚Äúlip‚Äù to rest his butt on so pee or poo was left on the stairs, and the fence accessory only encourages this. 

3) the fence accessory is useless if you have a ‚Äúdigger‚Äù. Litter is still all over the outside of box.  Also litter somehow winds up outside the back of the box for no reason also and clogs the power supply inlet which fails at some point. 

4) If you don‚Äôt change the bag every day, your house stinks. Maybe this is improved with newer model, but when I saw the price went up $300, I say NO!

Since I went back to the old $30 scoop box, my cats use this box more than the robots that are left, and I suspect it won‚Äôt be long before the last 2 shit the bed. 

When they are ‚Äúdone‚Äù ‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôm going back to the $30 box. 

My cats are acting normal, not lingering around the box waiting for it to spin ‚Äú guarding ‚Äú against other cats, no more litter tracked all over than the LR, and I have a sense of ease not reacting to blinking light, or stuck and unusable entryway
Not coming home to a nasty surprise üí©, or having to unexpectedly trouble shoot when we are exhausted. 
( we fight less about this too)

Frankly my husband and I are too old for this shit, and so are our cats. 
I can‚Äôt imagine having a Wi-Fi and notification feature so that you can know that there are all these problems While you are not at home and cannot do anything about it.



This seems like a really stupid idea.



So, just my two cents, and frankly if I had had prompt customer service to resolve some of these recent issues I may not feel as strongly,

But all around this is a bad product and terrible way to treat loyal customers."
"Frequent Interruptions During CycleHello,

I've been reading posts here for a while, trying every solution people offer, and I'm at my wit's end. First of all, thank you to everyone in this community for helping each other out, it's great to see!

I got a LR4 about a month ago. I like it, but it keeps stopping partway through a cycle with the red light on. I'll stand and watch it to make sure my kitties aren't sticking their heads in, and it'll stop 2 or 3 or more times. I'll press the reset button and it'll continue the cycle, then stop again, and I'll have to press it again. If I leave it alone, it USUALLY eventually continues and completes the cycle, but the interruptions are annoying and shouldn't be happening.

I gave it a good cleaning yesterday and changed the litter (from Tidy Cats to Arm & Hammer Slide), and it went through a few cycles without interruptions, but eventually it started happening again.

\- It's on a flat surface

\- It's not against a wall

\- When I was vacuuming the inside, I went over the sensors lightly

\- I ran a microfiber cloth over the sensors

\- The weight in the liner feels secure, not loose

\- The firmware is updated to the latest version

\- I reset the weight sensor when I changed the litter, and I've also done it in between cycles

&#x200B;

A friend suggested I take a little bit of litter out, so I did (and reset the weight sensor) and it went through a whole cycle without error, but now it's back to stopping a few times.

Is it the sensors on the top of the bonnet? The weight sensor? Neither? I would greatly appreciate any help."
"Cat sensor fault just after we‚Äôve left for a 3-week vacation!We‚Äôve never had this problem before over the last 6 months. Cleaned out the drawer and hit ‚Äòreset‚Äô like usual this morning. 

I got the sensor fault notification right after we got through airport security. LR4 is still paused and won‚Äôt cycle an hour later. What luck!!

House + cat sitter will be there today but is not familiar with LR, and we aren‚Äôt familiar with this error. 

What should we ask them to do to troubleshoot? Should we hedge our bets and have an old fashioned litter box shipped to the house? This is so frustrating."
"Did I get scammed? My LR4 came loosely in a brown box with zero foam or protection, and there is no power chord or instruction Manual to be found. What the heck‚Ä¶"
"Constant cat sensor faults on LR4I want to love this thing so bad. For such an expensive item that came highly recommended, I'm more than just a little disappointed. 

I initially had these cat sensor faults the moment I took it out of the box and set it up. My assumption was that I had used too much litter, so I removed some and that solved the problem for several days. I was happy. Cats were happy. It was great! Everything was working normally until it started with these cat sensor faults again a few days later. Only now it's happening every single time it cycles. No matter what I do, it will not complete a full cycle, under any circumstances, without getting stopped. Some more information: 

\- I've been through all the self-troubleshooting steps. Numerous times.   
\- I've wiped off the top of the globe where the lasers are, also several times.   
\- I've reset the scale constantly (by pressing the ""X"" button and watching the lights flash white)   
\- The LR4 is on a flat tile floor. No carpet or anything. Machine is totally level.   
\- If I power cycle the machine, it will complete a cycle one single time. Any cycles after that trips the cat sensor.   
\- I've unplugged the machine for a while.   
\- I saw someone recommend tilting the machine while powering it on. That didn't work either.   
\- I've removed it from the app and re-added it (I'm not sure why I thought that might work, but saw it recommended elsewhere and tried it)   


I contacted Whisker support more than a week ago and have heard absolutely nothing. I'm trying my best to be patient because I understand how busy they are currently. But after spending $700 on a machine that doesn't work and receiving zero support, I'm more than just a little frustrated. I've seen numerous complaints about this exact issue, so I was really hoping this was something simple that could be easily fixed, maybe with a firmware update. I'm really hoping I can avoid having to figure out how to box the thing up and send it back or get it replaced or having to wait 6-8+ weeks on a replacement, but I fear that's what's going to happen. I'm not really sure what else to do at this point. I'm open to any and all suggestions for anything I haven't tried yet. I'm so close to just giving up on it and going back to a regular litter box.

"Litter Robot BonnetWhen my litter robot rotates or it is in timer cycle phase, I get the notification ‚ÄúBonnet is removed‚Äù and the yellow light is flashing on the liter box. I check and the bonnet is secure. So I always have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the bonnet to get it to start rotating again. I even stand there watching to see if I notice anything coming loose - nothing does, but it stops rotating, the yellow light flashes, and I get the notification. So I am wondering should I get a new bonnet? Is the sensor or something going bad? Has any one else had this problem."
"Red light of death after two weeks useRed light of death after only a couple of weeks of use. At first, I could just reset it and it would work. Then, I'd have to power on/off and it would work. Then, I'd power it on and off and it would only move a bit and then stop. Now, it just stays red and won't move.

I tried the following to no avail:
1. Put in/took out litter
2. Emptied waste drawer and cleaned globe
3. Cleaned sensors (vacuumed and gently wiped)
4. Removed and then replaced globe
5. Checked gears
6. Cleaned all debris in and around unit thoroughly 
7. Changed litters
8. Tried to run empty
9. Checked that all areas were secure and nothing impeding movement
10. Cleaned off all legs
11. Placed on hard level surface ensuring nothing was touching it on any sides

I think I've exhausted all the troubleshooting. Sent in a ticket. Anxiously awaiting a response.

Was loving this thing, but right now it is an unreliable and unusable piece of crap. I'm scooping poop again. Only improvement is I have a collection box built in to the thing to dump the poop.

Very disgruntled customer atm."
"What a Sham**Update\***   
I want to take a moment to address Whisker support. Once I found the online portal, the support rep was very quick to respond and diagnose my issue. My unit is being replaced. Fingers crossed the new unit is as amazing as most people say. I hope Whisker's leadership is paying a competitive salary to factory and customer support workers of the litter robot. This is a really niche product with a very high price compared to what I can only assume is a low cost to manufacture based off of the quality of components. At any rate, my overall support experience was fantastic with very quick reply's. Will update on the turn around time for a new unit. 

  
**Original Post**   
Ok I know bad reviews are normally reported the most but I would like to start out by saying the LR4 was great! For appx 2 weeks. Now the bad:

Day 1

Assembled unit, worked great. When robot cycled, it seemed like the top of the unit was not secured in place. The lid would shift and create a small gap that has since seemed to widen during the cycles. Attempted calling the support number and got a message saying they are not taking support calls due to the large influx of calls. Great. I dealt with it since it seemed to be functioning fine.

Week 1

Noticed the cat weight sensor was way off. Our 5lb Cat was showing as 1.2lbs. Again not a big deal but would expect it to work with the price tag.

At least cleaning the unit is super easy.

Week 2

Noticed my cat using the bathroom in our plant pots. Checked the litter robot and it was stuck upside down with the waste bucket exposed. Cats obviously dont want to climb in. I checked my app and it was in this mode for about 45 minutes before I noticed it. Manually recycled the robot, all seemed well.

Week 2.5

Again cat using bathroom in plant pot... Im super upset at this point as I then needed to clean the mess, change the soil, check the robot, and cycle again.

Week 3

Litter Robot stuck upside down again. I followed the support site recommendations. Nothing blocking the sensors but I wiped them anyways with a dry paper towel. I then did the manual reset holding the connect and empty buttons on the robot. Waited a full 2 minutes and powered it back on. It worked for 2 Cycles. Then stuck upside down again.

I have now fully lost confidence in the litter robot. Support site is useless. There is no one to talk to. I paid far too much for a robot that I need to leave powered off when I leave the home so my cats have a bathroom.

&#x200B;

Edit\* I should say my biggest complaint is the troubleshooting and lack of support. There is no way in hell I should have to spend more than an hour troubleshooting a litter box. Let alone trying to find the serial number, order number, support site, etc to get a ticket submitted. For the price we pay for the product, there should be the ability to just submit a ticket (if that is the route they want to go) directly from the app. At the very least, there should be an easy way to chat with a support rep if they are no longer doing phone support."
"Should I hold off on purchasing a Litter Robot 4?I always wanted a litter robot as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone when I say cleaning up cat poop is the worst part of owning a cat. With the release of the LR4, I was very interested in purchasing one but this is what gathered in less than 30 minutes of searching Reddit for an answer:

The liner is thin and tears easily. 
The charcoal filter needs to sit correctly or it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit not on a perfectly flat 180 degree surface, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the litter is too heavy or too light, it won‚Äôt work. 
If there is too much litter or too little litter, it won‚Äôt work. 
If the unit is facing a window, it won‚Äôt work. 
If you have indoor security cameras with night vision, it won‚Äôt work. 
The chances of getting a machine that actually works in the first place isn‚Äôt too high and a lot of you are on your second LR4 unit already. 

The list goes on, and I‚Äôm truly wondering: is this nearly $700 machine truly worth it? If I‚Äôm paying that much for anything, I expect it to work without much troubleshooting and be reliable for a reasonable amount of time. Or should I hold off to see if any of these issues are addressed?"
"My Advice: WaitSo I've been following the LR4 for awhile now and while the initial response to it seemed great, more and more people are encountering delivery issues and product quality control issues. Bottom line is this company is not ready to service it's intended consumer-base. If you've already ordered, settle in for a ride on how not to treat your consumer base (I seriously hope they learn from this and get better because we want products like this to succeed in the market - its a cool product and is helpful for pet owners). If you haven't ordered yet, my advice is to wait until you have a stable delivery process, and stable product without bugs/quality issues, and a better customer service experience.

Production Issues: 25% of American homes have a cat. That's over 31million households. If only 1% of those households ordered a Litter-robot, that would be over 300,000 LR4s that would need to be produced. There is no way they got 1% of cat-households to order, but they should've looked into the numbers and been prepared for a high-demand response and supplicated orders to reflect that. Create a sign up list/waiting list. Keep in mind that they charged everyone at the time of order, Whisker essentially held $800+ from me for a product I didn't even see for 3 months.

Delivery Issues: I have never seen a company charge so much for a product only to not care if it ends up at its destination. Not only does it **not** require a signature, but they went with the cheapest shipping option of no updated delivery windows. I've had expensive packages ranging from $500-$2000 and all of those required signatures/secure delivery and had updated delivery windows on the day of to make sure I was there for the package. For your delivery you will receive a ""before end of day"" tracking window, which means you better be prepared to camp your door for your super expensive obvious machine that comes in a box that says ""Robot"" on the outside.*Skip this part if you don't want to read about my experience:* Ordered LR4 BLACK. Delivery by  mid July promised. Scheduled Vacation for end of August. Got informed of delayed shipment for Aug 25-Aug 31st. No Big Deal - re-scheduled Vacation for mid August. Packing for Trip on August 12th that leaves on Monday Aug 15th. Receive Email from Whisker that my package has shipped and will arrive Monday Aug 15th??? No email from Whisker to ask if a new delivery date was ok, no email to let me know that they somehow produced more units ahead of schedule. Delayed trip 3x days ( lose $400+ in hotel fees/lost rentals). Package does not arrive Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday(18th now if you're keeping track) - contact Fedex who says package is lost - contact Whisker who says somehow the package was shipped to California. Email chain with Whisker begins - package is shipped back to Whisker who promises to ship it out for Aug 25th. Today is Sept 23rd. I had to email on Sept 20th when I had not received any update on the status of my order and low-behold - order immediately shipped out and I got it today. But guess what... they got the address wrong again - and luckily Fedex fixed it this time and I got my package on time. Opened my package but oops - free gift wasn't included in this one; guess I should've vacationed to Cali to pick up my original package dang it.

Product/Quality Control Issues: See reddit threads. Various issues regarding the quality of the liner for the LR4, various issues with wiring, various issues with integrated software/hardware, and some people have complained of jamming. The app is outdated and seems to be throwing errors/incorrect information at every opportunity. I've also seen threads of people not receiving the promised free gift for the Black LR4 delay - that for some reason was kept super super secret?? (edit: to save people from searching: it was some cat toys and a 2pack OdorTrap). The Customer service phone number was turned off because of all the complaints/tickets that they've been receiving but you can still continue to order product from them online that they will immediately charge you for even though your product won't ship for another 2-3 months.

"First blinking blue ready, and then violently yellow blinking cycleSiiiigh. 

Litter Robot 3. 

I‚Äôve taken then thing apart multiple times, cleaned the sensors, made sure those two metal pieces are touching. I‚Äôve made sure the waste receptacle bag is pushed down and not blocking the sensors. I‚Äôve unplugged at the base. I‚Äôve unplugged at the wall. I‚Äôve ‚Äúreset‚Äù the unit.

"LR4 - smol bugHello all! I have the LR4 and so far I have absolutely loved it. I went from running into constant issues on my LR3 with how it dumped poo in one spot and ""filled"" too quickly to it working almost seemlessly with the LR4. Having to interact with the robot went from every 2 days to once a week (2 cats). 

The only small issue I have found is that, every time I have to add litter, I get the red blinking light error. I don't overfill and I have noticed that if I unplug and replug the bot, it cycles and goes back to working flawlessly. This isn't a huge deal but since I have a large bookcase blocking the outlet, I would rather not have to do that. I would just use my smart plug but it is one from my security company and has the plugs on the side which won't allow me to plug it in. 

Any tips for me?"
"LR4 Review - Big Kitty & back sprayerMy furbaby name is Archer, he is a 13lbs Siberian mix, 8 yes old and neutered. I rescued him at like 3 weeks old and raised. He has always backed up his tush to pee and despite all attempts he always chose to pee this way, he is also on the large/longer side and most cat boxes were not big enough, which resulted in us creating this custom tile cat bathroom in an unused corner, long story shorter, we lined the back wall of this custom cat bathroom with puppy pads attached to clips so he wouldn't be peeing on the tile wall (it was much easier to change the puppy pads that scrub tile)..that became just as time consuming as having to deal with plastic liter box leaks..it got worse for my poor cat with my depression and I sadly neglected to clean his bathroom as often, yeah the smell inside my master bathroom was strong...anyway I decided to bite the bullet and order the liter robot 4 because it looked roomier enough for my Archer. Yeah the price concerned me especially if he ended up hating it/not using; I felt like I owed it to Archer to give this a try for both of us. I was quoted a 6-9 week arrival time and it arrived in like 2 weeks. I set up the day it arrived but since it did not fit near his existing bathroom we put in a place where his liter box used. Archer was very interested in the movement and sound was not scary at all, he observed it for one week and the following weekend I decided to remove his bathroom and  do lots of pep talks with Archer. I scooped a poo and placed inside the LR4 explaining Arch that's the new loo and it would be way better than mommy and her hard days. He immediately went in there and did his business. He doesn't completely squat down to pee but doesn't quite back spray high up. We use pretty liter with it since it helps monitor urine pH levels to make sure he's not stressed or getting to a blocked stage. With the new bot loo arrangement he has been peeing a lot more, healthy and you can tell he's happy about how clean it stays. I'm so glad the opening for the LR4 is much bigger than the previous version, that was a huge point for me since Archer is big and I care about his comfort. The bonnet does seem a bit flimsy and not totally secured in place, kinda feels cheappy. Other than that we absolutely love it and highly recommend."
"PSA LR4 owners: Ghost cats triggering the unit to cycle: A MUST READI have owned my LR4 about 6 weeks so far.  Thankfully I read this sub for a bit before my unit arrived so I saw was the unit should be on some type of flat surface.

For the most part it is has been ok experience for me (please note I never updated the firmware on it a couple weeks back and to do this day I haven‚Äôt either).

But in the beginning I had the ghost cat cycling sporadically (2-3x a day) and looking at my camera (which doesn‚Äôt point directly at the LR4) I wouldn‚Äôt see either of our 2 cats even in the area.  Even looking at the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô in the app, there would no cat weights recorded.  A lot of people have been putting indoor security cameras pointing at their LR4‚Äôs to see when the kitties use the LR.  But the IR sensors from the security cameras that look at the LR4 mess with the 3 cat sensor beams that come from the top of the hood and trigger the unit to cycle with no cats present üò¢.

Small background, my LR4 is in our finished basement but in a utility room on the original cement floor.  At first I was having ghost cycling problems and the unit stopping mid cycle and getting stuck as well.  Upon further troubleshooting I realized I had the LR4 directly on the cement floor, yes, but the floor was sloped a good deal because it was near the French drain sump pump pit .  So then I moved it a bit and put a very thick plastic kitchen cutting board (from Amazon / so I could more easily clean+sanitize it VS plywood) underneath it and the cutting board was fairly long so it spanned the top of my underground sump pump pit + cover.  It worked pretty well there for 4 weeks or so until we had 5 straight days of rain and then sump pump started running with frequency. Then the LR4 started the ghost cycling again.  It took 1-2 days for me realize but even though it was on a thick plastic cutting board spanning a solid cement floor,  just the slight vibrations from the sump pump running was causing the ghost cycling.  On Tuesday I moved it to another part of the utility room and put the cutting board underneath it directly onto the cement floor and have not had one ghost cycle since.

So in short, my PSA after using the LR4 for about 6 weeks is it is SUPER SENSITIVE, so possibly even if your LR4 is on a 1st, 2nd, 3rd floor etc, if the floor just moves slightly sometimes to people in the house, things being moved around, etc I will cause the LR4 to sense something which then triggers the unit to cycle.  In the 2 days I had the LR4 on plywood spanning the underground sump pump, it probably ghost cycled 40-50 times.

In all of those 40-50 times never once in the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô did it ever log anything I saw so from the ghost cycling perspective it doesn‚Äôt help with troubleshooting.

Additionally, they may need to put out a firmware update so it isn‚Äôt so sensitive?!?  Don‚Äôt really know what the fix will be but not everyone has a solid cement level floor to put it on.

So in short, it the LR4 isn‚Äôt perfectly level and near any type of vibration it‚Äôll contribute to the ghost cycling.

Just wanted to share this information to help everyone in this sub!

"LR4 ""expert mode"" troubleshooting, please?The programmer / robot hacker in me has been thinking about the problems I (and others) have been having with the LR4, and I hope Whisker can give us a firrmware or API to do more debugging. Based on my experience and other posts here, it seems a bunch of robots went out the door without precise calibration or sensors and with unpredictable software. These things can be fixed in software if we have visibility/access to do so. Here are some robot troubleshooter's notes:

The promo video shows cat detection using an upper ""laser"" (though my investigation of it shows wider beam IR LED behavior, not tight-beam IR laser) and weight sensors and what it calls a ""cat presence sensor"" in the bottom front of the box. but doesn't tell us which sensor triggered the Cat Sensor Fault. 

The promo video shows weight detection, but does not allow the user to see the ""raw weight"" of sensors as they are detected or an kind of data export. Notably, we cannot get a live view of how full the litter level is, or how much ""cat"" is being detected. 

We are unable to adjust the sensitivity of any of the sensors. If the front sensor is acting up but the weight and laser sensors are fine, we cannot see that.

Without access to raw sensor data, we cannot see if we can change anything to make it feel better. If the top laser sees IR or UV light in the box from security cameras and that causes a fault, we don't know. If the cat's digging creates a big mound in the middle of the box, we don't know that it's tripping the sensor. 

Last time my cat box notified me it was ""full"" it was actually a bit OVER full and I had  to fish out a couple clumps that fell into the tray drawer area as I removed the tray. It would be nice to be able to calibrate when we reset it as ""empty."" and get a raw data amount when we get notified it's ""full"" (then set it to notify us about 3-4 cleaning cycles sooner.) 

**PROPOSED SOLUTION**
An ""expert mode"" in the app or an API to the LR4 that allows us to poll the robot and get live results. That's' all. Users will opt-in, crowdsource the troubleshooting data, and post our experiences with it, then report back. Boxes won't go back unless they are mechanically broken. Users can solve their own problems by knowing where the fauls are. Whisker's tech support has more data on common problems. Whisker's engineers and assembly staff have more data on which components need more attention. Everyone benefits."
"Weight on top won't dropI've had the litter robot for almost 6 months- no issues- but recently realized that the weight is no longer falling when it cycles. This results in some wet litter remaining stuck underneath everything else.

I did some internet sleuthing and could only find mentions of units that the weight had been dislodged from the center. The weight on mine is in the right place, it just won't fall down when the unit has cycled and the weight is on top. It used to fall.

What the heck?"
"My LR3 motherboard fried...So I made my own instead.

**tl;dr:** Litter Robot 3 motherboard fried, decided to make my own instead. Was lots of fun *and* way cheaper, 10/10 would do it again. Code and schematics on github, link below.

---

So... One sorry day of December, 2021, my Litter Robot 3 started acting weird.

First, it gave me a fast-flashing blue light, switching to slow yellow when pressing Reset. Then it started to freeze at bootup on a solid yellow light - no amount of cleaning or making sure the connectors were all secure helped. Nor did sanding the pinch detector, either.

Unfortunately, at that moment, it was just out of warranty, so my only option was to buy a new motherboard, and those things are expensive.

It turns out, the Litter Robot 3 is made of pretty simple electronics. Hell, the ""CPU"" on there is a PIC 16F microcontroller. There had to be a way to get all this to work again.

So, here's how this fail-safe (/s) machine works :
 * The biggest part of it is a 12V motor + reduction gear set that rotates the drum back and forth (with the gearset making it slow, but super high torque)
 * The drum contains tiny neodymium magnets, triggering hall sensors that act as end stop switches
 * The ""cat sensor"" is a simple load-sensitive resistor
 * The pinch detector is a basic mechanical switch made of two metal pieces
 * The most complex part apart from the motherboard is the DFI sensor, which I haven't reimplemented yet but shouldn't be too much of an issue.

The parts most prone to fail in there are the motherboard and the DFI sensors, which in my opinion look *way* over-engineered. 

*Cue a side-look to an ESP32 board lying on my desk...*

With all that in mind, I settled to making my own alternative motherboard out of an ESP32. Since I'm not going to be using the stock motherboard's form factor, using the original button placements is out of the way.

All parts included, I was able to make my own for around $15. When I make a final PCB instead of the prototyping board I used it shouldn't exceed $20.

I decided to ditch buttons altogether instead, switching to a fully remote control via a web app served directly from the ESP32, allowing for much finer control over the litterbox's settings.

No more beating around the bush, here's [the GitHub repository to the whole thing](https://github.com/xtrium-lnx/litter-eater).

The repo contains the complete electronic schematics, full source code (using the Arduino IDE) with (some) documentation about how I implemented this... thing.

Here are the features it currently has :
 * Over-the-air updating for when I screw around with code / when more features come along
 * Capture portal to connect it to your home Wifi network
 * Full control over the timings, from the delay before sifting to overshooting endstops (either to make litter horizontal again or to help with dumping)
 * Makes your fried Litter Robot eat cat poop again :')

What's left to do :
 * Pinch detection
 * Drawer full detection
 * (Maybe) Cat detection depending on weight
 * Push notifications when your cats go in or when the drawer's full

Edit: added a few details about the webapp."
"In what room did you put LR?In UK I don't know how to put it in the bathroom, there's no plug and trying to put extension will be a pain. Also, it's humid in there after bath, so not sure it's a great idea"
"LR3- constantly detecting cat.I‚Äôve had my robot for a while. It took a bit to get my cats to start using it so I still had their regular box which was being mostly used. I finally went cold Turkey with them and removed the regular cat box and they have been using robot exclusively YAY!  

However after having NO problems for 3 weeks. The robot now is constantly getting a cat fault. I started trouble shooting and now realize it seems to be constantly detecting a cat when nothing is near it. I will turn it off and on. It will cycle. Go to ready, and a few seconds after that will trigger cat timing. It then will have a fault. Sometimes while trying to cycle by hitting cycle or turning on and off it will fault mid cycle and stop cycle. It will sometimes make it through cycle. 

I did the trouble shooting hard reset and that didn‚Äôt help. I took it apart. Cleaned it and put it back together. It cycled fine then 2 seconds after ready had a cat timer trigger. I wasn‚Äôt sure what the contact points are on the bonnet. Is that the cat sensor?  I did clean them. There is gel on them when I first moved off and wasn‚Äôt sure that needed to be there???  Should I clean them dry?  

This is frustrating. As I do travel for days out of town for work and it stresses me this is suddenly doing this?  I only have one robot and thought of getting another but torn if this is going to be an issue. I hadn‚Äôt had this problem til recently. Bonnet is secure. The unit is clean. The litter is below fill line. 

I tried to do the chat but no one ever shows up. I did try to call but today is a Saturday and they are closed. I submitted a ticket finally. I do leave out of town in a few days and want to clear this up. 

Thanks!! Any help is appreciated!!"
"How I Taught My Skiddish Cat to Use LR3For those like me who tried everything and all the suggestions and nothing worked... This is how I transitioned my skiddish cat to the litter robot with complete success and ease (when I started doing it right).


First off I made big mistakes. But that's good because it means you can still reverse some behaviors! 

I made a split decision to order the litter robot because I needed to leave town and I felt bad having my friend deal with the boxes and thought it would be easier. I ignored the advice that the company gave with transitioning because I am dumb lol. 

So I'm gone for a week. I return. Our litter robot is near an office and the other boxes remained in the guest bathroom. 

I assume they're both using the bot due to timing intervals and clean, collapse the boxes and store them. 

I later found a piece of cat poo in front of the litter robot. Uh oh... Someone has not transitioned. This was confirmed when I found another poo a day later in front of the bot. Knowing my boys it was likely Leo. He's the younger more skiddish cat. 

So I implemented everything. I put the box next to the bot. I stopped cleaning the box. I got litter attractant. I fed treats and cat nip. I modified the shipping box. I purchased the stairs, I moved¬† the litter guard, kept it unplugged...All these suggestions from litter robot and online I did everything nothing was working!!!

So I turned to Jackson Galaxy's YouTube channel. Although he is not a fan of this type of litter box... He understands cat psychology very well. His advice has always worked for training my cats. So I visited his YouTube page and started to research.¬† Clearly I am doing something wrong... And I was.. I didn't realize that Leo was afraid of the Orb. He didn't like going into it. He must have attempted while I was out of town and it scared him because it was moving. So I screwed up. That AND... 

I didn't use the jackpot treat. Galaxy talks about what he calls the jackpot treat that is something so amazing the cats focus on you relentlessly. For my boys that is chicken. They go CRAZY for it. 

My mistake was the greenies treats I was using required the cat to put his head down and not look at me while he ate. Galaxy discusses how you should use very small bits of the jackpot treat because the cat will focus on you completely and they eat it so fast that they keep their attention on you.¬† More on this soon.. because there are other critical things to address first.. 

So what I did was this: 

First I need to see if he uses it or not. So I ordered a Eufy 2k Pan and tilt camera off of Amazon. It's a little over $50 but you don't have to do any monthly payments to record things like Wyze requires. I've been very impressed with Eufys quality and ease and I can always see if a pet walks by the litter robot because it'll send a message to my phone when a pet is detected (you have to manually turn on that feature in the settings).


Now for the litter robot: 

Keep it unplugged. Do not risk the bot moving terrifying the cat again. It has to be safe and happy. If you're using the stairs make sure they're secured otherwise if they shift it'll scare the cat. Make sure the orb is locked in with the big plastic key thing in the back so it doesn't shift and scare the cat!

This is so important that I'm going to say it again. You have to make everything happy and positive. It has to be amazing and wonderful and great. NOTHING can be scary. For example when you change the bag in the bot do NOT shake the bag hard to get it open or that will scare the cats and associate the bot with being scary so don't do it! Be calm, happy, and gentle always around the bot. 

Any time I had to move the litter robot or clean it I did not let the cats see it so they wouldn't get scared. I kept the cardboard box over the bot to hide the orb and make it less conspicuous 24/7 as described in the litter robot video. 

Next I moved the litter robot to the guest bathroom and put it next to his old box. I even kept the cardboard on the robot to hide the scary orb there as well. They've known this room as the poop room for a long while. Let's keep it the poop room. I even had to disassemble the bot to get it through the door but it was worth it! 

Every time I emptied the base of the litter robot I put that excrement in the old box. I made the old box less and less desirable. But Leo kept using it still I was absolutely blown away. 

So here comes the treats. I put Max (older cat) in another room with an activity ball full of treats. I sat down with Leo at the bot and would give him treats on the steps to let him know that it's ok and it's safe and it's positive. Then I would get the chicken out. What I did was air fry it, shred it into small pieces, let it cool, and put it in the bowl. 

For NO MORE than 10 minutes at a time (training with cats must be brief) I would place very small bits of chicken on the steps or the litter guard rim. This is the JACKPOT. This food they adore so much and don't get as often as I now realize they probably should.. is now associated with the scary litter robot. But is it scary? I mean the best treat is now here with the thing that sometimes turns! 

So after some time of doing this I would pet Leo and praise him and give him scratches on his favorite spots on his head. Then we were done. It is always important to leave the cat wanting more. Never make them full. Try to train before meals. If you leave them wanting more they'll be willing to do anything...

Doing this I noticed.. Leo is starting to go investigate the outside of the bot on his own. He's looking to see if there is anymore of that amazing chicken at the litter robot! So he definitely has now associated the bot with the happiest thing in his life. 

He still, however, wouldn't go in. 

So for the next few days we do this again with the chicken. I keep associating that the bot is safe and ok. I never pushed him in the bot because if I did that could ruin all of the progress. That method has worked for some people but it's way too risky. You need to make them choose to go in on their own. 

So I got a bowl that I didn't care about and I put a bunch of chicken in the bowl. I showed it to Leo so he knew immediately wow that's a LOT of jackpot! He will do ANYTHING to get it! 

So I held the chicken in the bowl and very slowly pushed my hand further and further into the orb. VERY SLOW. Like JUST out of reach for Leo to get. He would get close .. slow down .. contemplate the decision .. move slightly closer only if I was just in reach. If I moved too far he would back away. But as I slowly lead the bowl further back into the orb he finally put a paw over. We kept this up until his front 2 paws were in. Then I placed the bowl in the very very back. He finally plopped inside with all 4 paws on his own! So I picked up the bowl and moved it around him so he would turn around and face his head outside of the orb. I then held the bowl immediately outside of the orb for him to put only his head slightly out to eat plethora of amazing chicken! 

He stayed in on his own. He chowed down. I praised him with a high pitch happy voice and I scratched his head which he loves. When he finished the chicken he stopped and looked around the orb as if he realized hey this isn't so bad either that or I wonder if there's chicken in here (again he ate it with the bowl just outside the orb so he's not eating inside of it) He then looked around a bit more and exited the orb. I praised him more and cleaned stuff up and we called it a day. 


The next morning I decided to take a big step. I went into the poop room and closed the door so I could clean the robot without scaring Leo.. and I decided that since Leo has realized the inside of the orb is not so bad maybe he will give it a try today. So I collapsed and cleaned his old box and stored it away. I made sure my camera was set up. I cycled and again unplugged the robot. I put that giant cardboard back on.¬† I always made sure to keep it cleaned up before they ate so they'd be more tempted to use it however I also would sprinkle their old litter in there so they smell it and know. It also helped that one time Leo used the old box next to me so I put some of what I knew was his inside the robot. 

On top of that I moved the litter robot in the exact spot the manual box was so his habit of going to that location in the room would be maintained. 

So he eats breakfast. I'm exercising across the hall. And I turn and I see him climb right in, do his business, cover it up, and hop right out. I was amazed. My jaw dropped. I watched and rewatched it on my phone from the Eufy camera! He finally used the damn thing!

So then what I did was I slowly transitioned it to the room I wanted to use it in. Some suggest daily moving it closer and closer... Honestly I went faster than that. But again I monitored with the camera to make sure he's still using it. He was! 

Now it was time to remove the cardboard. This could be complete nonsense but I was determined to not let anything screw this progress up. After w few days of him consistently using the robot I made my next move.

I waited until the sun would set (Leo doesn't have great vision) and with the cats locked away I removed the cardboard box so I wouldn't scare them. Then hid the box away from sight so they wouldn't think it was there to use for relieving themselves just in case. I kept the lights dim and who knows if this helped but Leo was ok with big orb being visible. 

Finally it came time to train that the orb turning is ok. What I did first was I got the cats in a position near where the robot is but out of sight. I got chicken out and I fed it to them while I then turned the robot on to cycle. The treats should happen during the entire cycle process and even slightly before. Now when they heard that sound it becomes associated with something great! I didn't want to do this too frequently or for too long because I didn't want them to RUN in the room every time it cycled expecting chicken. 

So the next day we did this again but in the room with the bot. Progressively getting closer to the bot with giving small bits of chicken. I watched Leo as he would look at the orb and then eat some more chicken then he would look at the orb as it spun. He became curious rather than scared. I made sure to keep the chicken far enough from the orb so they never have a temptation to climb in during the cycle. Instead it was maybe closest on the stairs just to show Leo the machine is ok when spinning but it's just busy. Otherwise we would do these sessions somewhat in proximity. 

Next what I did was I plugged in the bot and kept it plugged in. But I would use the sleep feature that way it would only spin when I'm home. So I made it sleep when I left for work and sleep when I slept! Keep the timer to 15min! This helps the cat get away and maybe sit somewhere else when it finally cycles and allowed me to sometimes find out when it was going to cycle. 

The first time it spun while I was home I gave a mix of chicken and greenies. Again just in proximity sitting nearby the bot. I'm phasing the jackpot out because he is using it and not very afraid of it.¬† 

I used my Eufy camera to monitor the robot. I finally verified that Leo is on his own climbing into the bot and using it for relief, and now completely content with the cycling. 

Cats do things for a reason. Their language and culture is so different from us that it can be very easy for us to judge their behavior for the wrong reason. 

I really really hope this helps someone out there. I did NOT want to return this amazing product. It has made my life so much easier and I definitely hope it continues to do just that!

EDIT: FYI with the Eufy camera if you use a micro SD card you don't have to sign up for that optional payment cloud service. Just get a 128GB micro SD card and you're set.

EDIT2: OMG i spelled Skittish wrong so many times lol. Sorry about that."
"Bonnet Removed ErrorHas anyone come up with a long term fix for the bonnet removed error?

I started getting the error a while back, filed a support ticket and got a new bonnet.  It worked fine for about a year and I started getting the errors again.  Filed another ticket and they sent me a new base. After 9-10 months, it's doing it again.  I just submitted another ticket, but I'd love to know if anyone has any other fixes I can try.  The bonnet is attached securely and the connections are clean."
"Getting your Cat Acclimated 

In most cases, cats will quickly adapt to a new litter box. If your cat is having a hard time adjusting to the Litter-Robot, we have included some tips and tricks that have worked for our customers in the past. You can also try googling tips.

1. When starting out with the Litter-Robot, leave the base unit turned OFF. It is best to wait until you see evidence of consistent use before turning the base unit ON to use the automatic cycling. If a clean cycle is required during the acclimation period, just run the cycle manually by turning the unit ON and then OFF again after the cycle has completed. Once you feel your cat is comfortable using the Litter-Robot, you can then resume the automatic mode (leaving the unit ON).

2. Keep the old litter box in the same room or next to the Litter-Robot and let it fill up. This will give your cat a choice between the clean Litter-Robot and a not-so-clean litter box.

3. Put some soiled litter into the Litter-Robot for a familiar scent.

4. Use Cat Attract additive. There is a brand of litter by Dr. Elsey‚Äôs called Cat Attract. There are also ‚Äúcat attract‚Äù products on the market that you sprinkle into your normal litter. You can find it by doing a search online.

5. Place treats on the ledge or around the Litter-Robot so that your cat associates rewards with the unit. One customer even placed treats in a dish inside the unit to get their cat to go inside and see that it is safe and has clean litter.

6. Sit down with your cat next to the unit. Comfort him and show him that the Litter-Robot is not to be feared. Customer Service Code: 5050

7. Another customer placed the globe on the floor and secured it so that it would not rotate. Having the globe at eye level helped the cat to feel more comfortable entering the globe.

\*\* If you've kept your old litter box, some of the litter boxes are big enough so the globe can be placed on it securely. We had a customer try this, her cat started using it, and continued to use it after she replaced the globe on the Litter-Robot base!

8. Since cats are curious and love to go into boxes, you might also try putting the original packaging box over the Litter-Robot with a hole cut out for the entry and the drawer.

9. Don't block the unit or create a place where the cat could feel ""trapped.""

Here is a video with some more information:

"Litter robot Unresponsive Solid Yellow lightI've been dealing with a messed-up robot since last week, it kept cycling,  trying to overcycle, and not cycling at all.  I've cleaned the entire unit of debris, taken off and cleaned the DFI casing, qtipped the dfi itself and I'm sure the bonnet is secure with all 4 tabs and the metal for the light isn't corroded.

Originally I've been getting the blinking blue light censor, (until I completely removed cleaned and reattached the dfi cases) but now it's switched to unresponsive solid Yellow (Power button doesn't work.) 

I've found when I unplug it for a few minutes with the waste drawer completely removed, the blinking blue light returns. When I press the power button and reboot it,  the solid yellow light returns (with and without the waste drawer.) 

After it sits for a while the light starts to flash yellow and becomes responsive again. 

Any ideas?"
"PSA: New owners - calibrate your waste bin sensor right away and wrap your bags like thisThis should just be part of the setup instructions. When I first plugged in my LR3, I got a ‚Äúdrawer full‚Äù alert right away, but it hadn‚Äôt been used once. After searching, I found an unlisted youtube link with some troubleshooting steps: https://youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=ThG4HMX2qwU

Solved the problem right away! Seems to be a known issue, so I‚Äôm surprised LR doesn‚Äôt just have customers do this during setup.

Also wrap the bag around the back of the drawer, using only the front tabs to secure it (NOT how LR gives it to you, my bag was all tucked into the tabs so I‚Äôm guessing yours will be too). This will prevent litter from falling in the drawer, under the bag"

"Something I wish I had known before ordering furniture from Whisker.Apologies for the long post! I just wanted to share my experience. I purchased the Coastal Credenza for my Litter Robot from Whisker, and it arrived damaged. The box was cracked open with dents all over it‚Äîreally bad condition. I reached out to Whisker to let them know that I would like to return it. They told me to request a return which, unless I had asked, would have required me to pay for the return shipping. I was also informed I would need to deliver the furniture to FedEx to return it. *Cue the record scratch* Hold up, this thing is HEAVY, and you want me to take this 111lb furniture to a FedEx? Even though this is not just an ‚ÄúI changed my mind return.‚Äù I foolishly assumed that because Whisker schedules pick-ups for the litter robots that weigh 24 lbs that, they would obviously schedule a pick-up for furniture that weighs over 100 lbs. I am 5‚Äô2 there is no way I can pick this thing up, heave it into my car, get it out of the car, and into a FedEx. Not to mention anyone who doesn‚Äôt have transportation? Customer service repeatedly said that it‚Äôs the policy and that they are sorry, but that is what I must do. Whisker clearly has an account with FedEx, which they use to schedule pickups for the litter robots. Why can‚Äôt they just schedule a pickup for the furniture? In the end, the customer service rep said, ‚ÄúI will transfer your case to the returns team. I have spoken to their management and they approved a pickup, typically we can not set this up. It is a special exception due to the circumstances.‚Äù It‚Äôs the ‚Äútypically we can‚Äôt set this up‚Äù for me. This should not be an ‚Äúexception‚Äù it should be their policy for damaged products. Going back and forth with customer service is not fun and takes a lot of time. If I had bought it and changed my mind, I would think their request is fair. But that is not what happened, and I sent them pictures to show the damage. Anyway, maybe I am being unreasonable, but this just felt uncool and is something that would have made me reconsider my purchase entirely. I am currently waiting for an email for next steps.

ETA: They are scheduling a FedEx pickup. I am happy with this outcome. However, I do hope that they see this and make a change to their policy when the damage is at the fault of the manufacturer or shipping carrier. Customers shouldn‚Äôt have to push so hard and spend so much time with CS to get a fair resolution."

This time I am having more trouble since we had a power outage the weight sensor is overly sensitive despite my attempts at using the reset to tare the scale.

All of that is annoying but what really makes me hate this product is why are there so many sensors? It's fairly obvious that either these are poorly made or that these sensors are very fragile. So why have so many of them? Why do I need an infrared sensor AND weight sensor to detect the cat? Why do I need a sensor preventing it from running when the bonnet is open? How am I supposed to investigate and diagnose problems when I can't even run the thing without it being closed up?

I would in a heartbeat take this product with the infrared, bonnet, and pinch sensors removed or even just disabled. It has fewer fault points and annoyances for when something inevitably breaks. Oh and the connect+reset hard reset doesn't do anything so I don't know if that's a firmware/model thing or if this thing is just bricked."
"Motor replacement for LB3UPDATE: When I had the motor assembly disassembled I put some silicone oil on the spindle and let it work its way down. It wasn't quiet at first but after a couple cycles the oil must have worked into the motor enough to keep it running smooth. Been great last 3 days. I know it will still eventually go out but this will buy it a fair bit more time.


Has anyone found a model number for the actual motor for the 3? They sell the entire assembly and gear box with the motor for 50 bucks but I just need the actual motor. Only info printed on it was 

12v 5600emc

Should be just a generic motor and not proprietary to litter robot. I'm surprised they don't sell the part, it's super easy to separate from the gearbox"
"Constant SMELL! Tell me what I‚Äôm missing here.I‚Äôve had a Leo‚Äôs Loo Too for a few weeks now and cannot for the life of me figure out the STANK situation. I know this is a LR community, but I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall might have a solution or pointers. Here‚Äôs the scoop:

We‚Äôre first time cat owners. I never in a million years would‚Äôve guessed we‚Äôd be a cat family (single mom w/2 teens). Or that we‚Äôd be so head over heels in love with our sweet boy! We adopted him, a 7 month old Russian Blue mix, 6 weeks ago.

The first 3 weeks we used a traditional hooded litter box with √ñkocat Original and it worked great. He had no issues and acclimated right away. There was zero (and I mean ZERO) smell other than when he dropped a log, which we would scoop fairly quickly. 

What led me to an auto litter machine was the idea that it‚Äôd be self scooping during the day when we‚Äôre all gone, and his solid waste wouldn‚Äôt be sitting there for hours while we are away. After spending hours and hours researching all different types of litter machines I decided to get the LLT.

As per the guidelines, you‚Äôre required to use clay clumping litter or it voids the warranty. I used Dr Elsey‚Äôs in this new setup and was happy to see our little guy hop right in and use it with no issues. I‚Äôve got to say the unit itself, the mechanism, the dumping, the app, the settings‚Ä¶all great!! 

BUT‚Ä¶by the end of day 2, the smell was getting real funky. He‚Äôs not an overly heavy urinator and his solids aren‚Äôt crazy putrid or anything, so I was confused as to why it would be so dang stinky so quick. I emptied the drawer, which has 2 charcoal filters in it and I added baking soda to the drawer, the bag, and a sprinkling in the litter itself. The next morning things smelled much better. 

But 2 more days of regularly sprinkling baking soda went by and we‚Äôre back to the stanky stank. The drawer wasn‚Äôt even full but it smelled like a diaper dumpster on a hot summer day. Now when I say it smells, I‚Äôm not talking the whole entire house. We have it in the bathroom where there‚Äôs a window and fan for airflow and ventilation. The smell is mostly isolated to the bathroom and then it starts to waft out in the hallway by day 2. I have to leave the window cracked and fan on 24/7 to keep the smell somewhat contained.

At that point I switched up his wet food because I‚Äôve read that that can greatly affect the smell of their waste. So it‚Äôs now a rotation of Sheba and Tiki Cat. I also bought Rocco & Roxie Litter Box Odor Eliminator to add along with the baking sofa, and I switched to BoxiePro litter since I‚Äôd seen so many great reviews about it on here. Alas, nothing changed. The new litter was great for a day and the additives would mask the smell for a few hours and then we were right back to Stankytown.

Last weekend, I completely disassembled the whole thing and thoroughly cleaned it top to bottom in every crevice of the drum, drawer, and underbelly with an enzyme cleaner from Nature‚Äôs Miracle. Keep in mind, that‚Äôs only after the first 2 weeks. I then bought 2 Fresh Wave Odor Eliminating jars and put them both underneath, one in the waste drawer and one next to the drawer pushed to the back of the unit. Well, same as before. Good for one day and we‚Äôre smelling absolutely rotten again, and the odor is seeping out further than the bathroom.

I just ordered an air purifier from Amazon as my one last attempt at figuring this out and I‚Äôve decided to empty the drawer every night as a way of mitigating the absolute stench from taking over everything.

But sheesh‚Ä¶for the amount of $ spent on this machine I‚Äôd think it‚Äôd do a much better job of keeping the smell contained. Perhaps someone out there has the magic answer!  If the air purifier doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm going back to the plain old litter box with √ñkocat."
"How to get cats to not cover their poo/pee in the roboI have three cats. They've acclimated to it fairly quickly, but I'm running into an issue where they are twirling around inside the robo trying to cover their poo/pee and end up stepping on older clumps/getting some poo on their fur that sometimes are on the sides of the inside of the dome.

One of my cats is pretty long, so when he poos it tends to end up on the walls of the robo.

Any advice??"
"Experiences with elderly cats & their active bladders? üêà‚Äç‚¨õRight now, I‚Äôve been using the Purina Breeze because it‚Äôs been fairly good even if it‚Äôs a bit pricier.

Id invest whatever they need, but want to be sure my oldest won‚Äôt have too much trouble with it before I buy it. <3 

But wondering how the Litter Robot fares with older cats with active bladders? 

Thanks so much!"
"Constant issues with LR4 Please helpUpdate- I contacted support through their website because the click here link in the app wasn't clickable... Anyways they replied pretty quick and are sending a replacement base.  

I got the Litter robot 4 about a month ago and at first loved it.  I was hesitant to buy it based on the price but kept reading story after story of how great it is and figured I'd give it a try.  we have 4 cats and the youngest 2 took to it fairly quickly and with the exception of them constantly sticking their heads in when it was cycling causing it pause repeatedly, it seemed to work flawlessly.  

about a week later, all 4 cats have adjusted to it but now we start to have the same issues over and over.  One problem is that it constantly reports full after ever cleaning cycle.  with a fresh liner in place(and they are the LR4 liners) we might get one cleaning cycle where it doesn't report being full but by the second cleaning cycle it's flashing full.  during the day it's not as big a deal to be hitting the cancel button after each cycle, but overnight is always a problem and when we get up in the morning and cycle it, when the litter falls(usually heavy clumps) the unit stops and the light goes solid red.  this has been the second issue that is making me regret this purchase.  you can't cancel the red light like you can when it detects a cat.  the unit becomes frozen and nothing fixes it.  I tried unplugging it for a minute and then plugging back in and it goes through it's initial light sequences and then stops with a half green half red light bar.  ultimately the only way I can get it working again is by removing the bonnet and manually returning the globe to the start position.  I've been doing that multiple times a day and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't paid $700.  

I have researched all the tips and solutions and nothing works more than a day most.  we have it on a hardwood floor, level, not on a rug, not touching any walls.  I have removed the globe and cleaned out any stray litter. I have cleaned the sensors with a dry rag.  I have made sure the liners are on tight and not sticking out where they can get caught.  I also installed the newest firmware this week without any improvement.  I want to love this thing but all I'm feeling is buyer's remorse."
"Daily Cat Sensor Fault error makes the Litter Robot 4 uselessI'm really pissed off. We've had our unit for a few months and it constantly freezes mid-cycle with a ""Cat Sensor Fault"" error and a red light. It's so unreliable, we can't leave it alone with our kitties overnight for fear of this happening. Thus, we setup a regular litterbox as a back-up. I'm seeing this issue widely reported by other people as well. Shame on Whisker for allowing such an unreliable product out the door without the proper QA process in place! I had an LR3 for years. What a disappointment their new product is!

&#x200B;

Edit: Just want to provide an update to be fair to LR. The last firmware update fixed these issues. Our LR4 is now working consistently as expected. We can even leave for vacation now without worrying about the unit freezing. All is well! Thanks for fixing this LR! "
"New litter robot owner with some questions/concernsI'm a new Litter Robot 4 owner with a few questions/concerns. To start, I know there's a reputation in the sub for negativity (which to me is fair for $800 litterboxes that come with defects and errors), but I want to mention that my partner and I love the benefits of these boxes enough that we're genuinely trying to work through the problems we've been experiencing in our first week to make these fixtures in our lives.

1. One of our units drops wifi. I've tried looking to see what people do for this issue, but have had mixed results. For the people that have had this issue and had it resolved, what did you do? Did Whisker help? My first conversation with Whisker was pretty annoying; the person kept explaining that it simply had to be my internet (everything else but the litter box, including the other Litter Robot, works perfectly on it) or that I ""should move the litter robot next to my router"". Bad answer for the expensive product that drops wifi constantly.

2. We just found today that the other Litter Robot we got had a piece of plastic underneath the bin hanging off. I'm very gentle with expensive electronics and we have had this for under a week (for reference we've emptied a 90% full bin once); I know I did not do anything to break an ostensibly sturdy piece of plastic off. I think it had a hairline fracture either from the factory or during shipment. Does anyone have experience with this happening? Would they ship a big piece of plastic for me to install or would they want the whole unit sent back?

Again, I want to make these work. As egregious as I think these issues in week 1 are, the cats love the boxes and we love the basic functionality. If I can get these resolved, I think they'd be A+ products. But based on the sounds of things, Whisker definitely has a quality control problem. Any help is appreciated!

"Alternating flashing blue and yellow lights on LR3...just shoot meUpdate: I fixed the issue...details at the bottom of the post.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Welp, once again I'm beating my head against a wall trying to fix this ridiculous machine.

**The problem:** A few days ago I did my normal cleaning (wiping out the inside of the globe, brushing litter off the top of the pinch detector bar, verifying the DFI sensor wasn't blocked).  When I turned the bot back on, it showed the **slow flashing blue light**.  I pressed Reset and it switched to the **rapidly flashing yellow light**.  Press Reset again and it switches back to the slow blue, and the cycle repeats.  The app history shows a Drawer Full fault and a Pinch Detect fault, as expected.

**What I've tried:**

* Hard power cycle (unplug the power from the bot, hold the power button for \~5 seconds), then restart it.
* Thoroughly cleaned the pinch detectors and the bonnet sensors.  I also used light grain sandpaper to polish them and get rid of any corrosion/dirt that had built up.
* The magical black chip on the circuit board the pinch detectors are connected to was already clean, but I used an alcohol-soaked Qtip to wipe the contacts anyway.
* After all that failed, I even tried bypassing the pinch detectors by taping them together with electrical tape.  Still no change.

Customer Service was no help whatsoever (shocker).  They didn't provide any tips or suggestions for things to try, just said I had to either send the base in for repair or order a DFI replacement kit and fix it myself.  We have two of the LR3s and have already replaced the DFI on both at least once.

Anyone have any other ideas for things to try?  Losing my mind with these things!

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Update: After consulting LR customer service, I ended up ordering and replacing the DFI kit.  It was fairly easy to install using the videos on their website.  After finishing the installation, the flashing lights disappeared and the bot cycled fine, BUT a new problem appeared: it was rotating PAST the normal stopping points during the cycle, and the ""home"" position was slightly crooked.

Apparently there's a position sensor in the compartment the control board is in (behind the buttons and lights).  It's a small, flat, black plastic piece with two metal contacts that slide onto a couple of tabs to the left of the motor.  When installing the DFI kit, I must've dislodged the sensor, which was causing the globe to not know when to stop properly during a cycle.  When I reopened the compartment, the sensor was just hanging loose, so I reseated it on the tabs and voila, problem fixed.  

Haven't had any issues since then!"
"One of my kittens is far too interested in the cleaning cycle.Now, we‚Äôve only had the Litter-Robot 4 for just over a week. Both cats took to it fairly quick. The cat in question took to it instantly. They are both about 4.5months old. One is more adventurous than the other but as soon as a cycle starts no matter where they are in the house they run for the robot. 

My app history is full of cycle interruptions I‚Äôve watched it in person to see it too. I‚Äôve even picked up the kitten or moved her away just to see how much she needs to watch this. 

Each time she interrupts it she goes in, trills and pads around inside, paws at the bits here and there, jumps out, and jumps back in, rinse and repeat. Often she will jump out and wait for the cycle to resume, then jump back in. Once she got in while the waste bin portion was open to air. I don‚Äôt know if it concerns her that there is (I presume) so much odour. She seems to try covering it by pawing on the plastic walls but also steps down into the waste bucket üò≥üôÑ

As for things I‚Äôve tried:

- Leaving sleep mode on  24/7 - trigger manual cycles through the day. What‚Äôs the point? It changes nothing but frequency of the cycle but not the behaviour.

- Set maximum delay before a cycle starts. This has probably been the best thing, plus sleep mode through the night. The idea is that it becomes more about using the litter than the cycle. But not to the point it becomes a manual cycling affair. 

Not sure if the kitty is just curious, I assume so, or disturbed by the fact that her scent keeps getting removed. I once watched her (not ‚Äúwatch watch‚Äù), go pee, get out, wait and interrupt the cycle (short delay at that point), then poop at the point just before the litter vanishes behind the grate, then get out and keep interrupting the cycle‚Ä¶when it finally completed after about 20min she went back in, and as if by magic pooped again as soon as it was done. She seemed ‚Äúquite concerned‚Äù when sniffing around when it was clean, so who knows‚Ä¶maybe she wanted to scent it up. I don‚Äôt mean to humanize her motives but I‚Äôm trying for some sort of rationale. Maybe she was actually doing me a favour and being patient before pooping? I have no idea what goes through a cat brain. 

Finally, when trying to keep her out during a cycle using my foot or picking her up, it‚Äôs almost like trying to keep an adult cat from catnip. It borders on a bit crazy trying again and again to get back in. I won‚Äôt be doing that again, I was just trying to see how much this was curiosity or need vs something else. She was pretty worked up trying everything to sneak back in. I don‚Äôt want to do anything to dissuade her from using it and trying to stop her from interrupting it is obviously pointless, she couldn‚Äôt separate the two concepts I‚Äôm sure, so I‚Äôll let her do her thing.

So I give up. She is using it right, at least initially, I have the longest delay set in hopes they might be too occupied to bother with it. My concern is she will start to trigger cycles and do her business mid cycle or get her paws into the waste bin consistently, I don‚Äôt want it to be come part of her routine. 

Anyone have a cat who was like this but settled down? Her sister is sane, on this issue at least üòÇ

So should I stay with the king delay cycle? Or set it as short as possible so it keeps triggering a cycle in hopes she bores of it?"
"Extremely Disappointed with the Recent Lack of SupportI know this has been talked about before but it‚Äôs a bit out of hand at this point. I have an LR3 and wanted to order the LR4 before I saw all the issues it was having shortly after launch. In the mean time my second LR3 which was replaced about 6 months ago started to have issues with the cat sensor. I reached out to support several times and never heard back, before posting this i messaged u/litterrobot directly via Reddit and was told my issue would be escalated, haven‚Äôt heard a thing since. 

This is beyond frustrating, there is no support via email, no access to chat, and no way to call. I understand growing pains and I think all of us here come from a place of understanding and willingness to ride out the storm because we believe in the company. However there is a fine line between being understanding and also having a fair expectation for support on a very pricey product. At this point I don‚Äôt think is too much to ask for at least a response in 24/48hrs. It‚Äôs been a week since I reached out and my issue was escalated. 

I believe this is a product that we come to rely on very much. This issue came up a week before me going on a trip and I did everything I could to find a resolution before leaving. I am now having to figure out how manage my litter situation while I am away. My plans to purchase a new LR4 are out of the picture and my expectation and ideas that the company will do what‚Äôs right are gone."
"Crystal litter is the best for litter robot 4I tried boxiepro clay, micro crystal clumping and normal crystal litter. 2 cats.

- Boxiepro clumped great, even too well. My cats had clay stuck to their back paws every time and one always had a wet butt after peeing. This was way messier than any crystal litter both around the box and wherever the cats paws landed. Too much mopping. Smell was average.

- Exsquisitcat Micro clumping crystal was just ok. It was much cleaner outside of the litter box and it didn't stick to my cat's paws or give them wet butts, but whatever makes this crystal litter (weakly) clump made the litter stick to and harden to the litter robot. I mean you had to SCRAPE it off and sometimes soak it for it to come off. Waste of time. It also stunk compared to the other litters because of this, since the hardened stuff had the piss in it and wasn't being mixed with more crystal or falling into the box.

- Exsquisicat regular crystal litter has been great! The pee doesn't clump which is a GOOD thing because it doesn't stick to the LR. You're supposed to MIX crystal litter daily so the crystals soak up the pee (and smell) and the litter robot does exactly that when it spins. The poop goes down like normal. The smell is AMAZING. I can only smell something if I stand right next to the robot (I have a strong sense of smell) whereas the others I could smell around the corner to varying degrees. There was one time the crystals clumped a little by a corner and a quick knock let it fall down.

To be fair, I haven't tried any clay litters besides boxiepro but I don't intend on trying not that I've found crystal litter to work so well.

Edit: exsquisicat changed their size and can't fit through the grate anymore. All of it dumps into the bin. Fresh step crystals work though!

Also, micro crystals didn't handle pee and smell as well as the bigger ones."
"Best litter for scatterHi everyone,
Does anyone have recommendations for a type of litter that helps to minimize scatter? I recently got my LR. I have the large LR mat which helps trap a lot, but I‚Äôm still getting litter scatter all around the house; having to vacuum multiple times a week. Im currently using tidy cats free and clean. Thanks.

Edit: forgot to mention that my cat has asthma so I need it to be fairly dust-free and preferably unscented."

"Drawer Sensor constantly triggeringheya! i bought a new LR4 unit and it was delivered about 6 weeks ago. It‚Äôs been mostly functional since then. The dome light wasn‚Äôt working, but that felt fairly minor. however, today the dome light suddenly started working and the robot constantly detects movement in the drawer. there‚Äôs no movement. i‚Äôve sat and watched, with the drawer out, and there‚Äôs definitely no mice sneaking in there üòÖ

i‚Äôve tried an abundance of solutions here, from a deep clean of the unit, including removing the globe, to putting paper towers under the feet to hope it may stabilize it. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs having an electrical issue since the light started working at the same time that the sensor issue started occurring. 

has anyone else experienced this situation or have any other ideas i could try? thanks!"
"Solution for the most common LR3 failureThis is for those that are out of warranty or want to quickly fix their LR3's infamous blue flashing light, (Drawer full message), yellow fast flashing light (pinch detect) or are experiencing a labored motor sound when in cycle that eventually results in a Over torque fault, (Alternating yellow to red lights). These conditions are a direct result of the DFI failing.

The issue with the LR3's DFI is the fact the emitter board's I/O expander chip pins are being subjected to excessive moisture causing corrosion on the bank of pins that are exposed by the DFI shield's opening located at it's center is breaching the inadequate clearcoat that's suppose to render the circuit boards moisture resistant. (I've also noticed some of the solder joints to be less than adequate as well contributing to the issue). As a result 1 or more of the chips pins are experiencing tarnishing and corrosion creating bad solder joints. (the solder used has a high silver content and little to no lead, when silver is exposed to moisture it tarnishes, it turns, you guessed it?!, BLACK!)I have 3 LR3's and they all have suffered the same issue. When they were in warranty I had the DFI kits sent out and I kept the old DFI's. When the third one went I noticed the tarnishing on the chip pins, so I took a look a look at the old replaced DFI's and sure enough the same tarnished corrosion on the same spot!

The good news is its salvageable without replacement!!! The fix is to remove the DFI from the base unit, carefully clean as much of the corrosion off the pins as possible and re-solder all 10 pins on that side of the chip. Verify the work, clean all the flux off, and use a clear coat to seal the chip pins up so the problem doesn't return!!!

I've done this to many DFI boards and they work perfectly! I've only had one I/O chip failure and the replacement part literally is $1.50!!, It's a no-brainer financially!!! To me re-soldering SMT (Surface Mount Technology) components is fairly easy and if you have the solder skills, Awesome!.  Unfortunately to most its rocket science. But!, if you know someone that can do it or have an electronics repair shop in your area its literally a 5 to 10 minute job!!! And it will in 99.999% of the time get you back up and running once again!."
"Selling a LR?Has anyone had luck selling a used LR3? I was thinking either on here or FB marketplace. We actually love it, but my three cats definitely prefer the other two ‚Äúdumb‚Äù boxes we have, and it seems like such a waste for such minimal use."
"LR4 liner holes after less than 2 monthsI‚Äôve seen a few comments in LR FB groups and on here regarding the LR4 liner developing holes, and I unfortunately am seeing the same thing after less than 2 months. 

 Some background: we have 3 cats, none of which are big ‚Äú diggers‚Äù and don‚Äôt excessively scratch at the robots. We have had a LR3 as the only litter box for the 3 cats , for 2 years and the liner is unscathed! 

Yesterday As I was dumping the kicked-out litter back into the LR4 ( a sometimes daily occurrence ‚Ä¶ highly recommend using a dog crate tray to catch that if mats aren‚Äôt sufficient for you ), I noticed a hole in the liner right where the litter sits and another one on the side! I will admit that I thought maybe others who were experiencing the liners deterioration maybe had cats that messed with it / excessively dig/ bite the liner ‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt seem to always be the case, because my 3 don‚Äôt do those things. . .Kick litter out of it for fun and to torment me ? Yes, absolutely‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs the extent. 

 I reached out to whisker and sent photos and they initially said they‚Äôd send me a new liner, but then said they don‚Äôt have installation videos yet, so they‚Äôd be sending me a whole new unit and I‚Äôll send this one back ‚Ä¶ to be fair , I would be fine with written direction for installation, but this may just be easier for them right now , having units boxed and ready to go and not a surplus of pieces. 
 I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre resolving my issue , but I‚Äôm concerned now that I‚Äôll be doing this again in a couple months. Not only that, but now I feel like I need to inspect this robot more often to make sure it‚Äôs intact, and that shouldn‚Äôt be the experience for something advertised to make being a cat owner ‚Äú easier‚Äù. 
 I sincerely hope they are working on a solution for the liners in the 4, it‚Äôs clear that this is a fairly common issue already and it‚Äôs disappointing that this wasn‚Äôt corrected while they were being beta tested. I can‚Äôt imagine it being cost effective to ship replacement units out to folks constantly."
"LR3 issues getting ""stuck"" upside down for no reasonHi, LR3 Connected. Have had for a little over 2 years and love it. Works great w/two cats.

Getting the dreaded ""lets get stuck upside down with no litter"", which we at least get reliable ""clean cycle interrupted"" messages.

It's obviously after one of our two cats does their thing, but no cat or anything goes into the LR. I just observed. Cleaned it a month ago, so everything is fairly tidy and no sensor blocked.

Is there a way to debug this besides coming upstairs to a treat from our male cat? Our female usually acts funny and howls, I assume because she holds it in.

To reset? We have to un-plug and then hope when you re-plug, the bin goes into ""reset"" mode and can find the 0 datum on the rotating part. Sometimes, it requires multiple unplug<->plug, reset, cycles to get this to happen though."
"PSA LR4 owners: Ghost cats triggering the unit to cycle: A MUST READI have owned my LR4 about 6 weeks so far.  Thankfully I read this sub for a bit before my unit arrived so I saw was the unit should be on some type of flat surface.

For the most part it is has been ok experience for me (please note I never updated the firmware on it a couple weeks back and to do this day I haven‚Äôt either).

But in the beginning I had the ghost cat cycling sporadically (2-3x a day) and looking at my camera (which doesn‚Äôt point directly at the LR4) I wouldn‚Äôt see either of our 2 cats even in the area.  Even looking at the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô in the app, there would no cat weights recorded.  A lot of people have been putting indoor security cameras pointing at their LR4‚Äôs to see when the kitties use the LR.  But the IR sensors from the security cameras that look at the LR4 mess with the 3 cat sensor beams that come from the top of the hood and trigger the unit to cycle with no cats present üò¢.

Small background, my LR4 is in our finished basement but in a utility room on the original cement floor.  At first I was having ghost cycling problems and the unit stopping mid cycle and getting stuck as well.  Upon further troubleshooting I realized I had the LR4 directly on the cement floor, yes, but the floor was sloped a good deal because it was near the French drain sump pump pit .  So then I moved it a bit and put a very thick plastic kitchen cutting board (from Amazon / so I could more easily clean+sanitize it VS plywood) underneath it and the cutting board was fairly long so it spanned the top of my underground sump pump pit + cover.  It worked pretty well there for 4 weeks or so until we had 5 straight days of rain and then sump pump started running with frequency. Then the LR4 started the ghost cycling again.  It took 1-2 days for me realize but even though it was on a thick plastic cutting board spanning a solid cement floor,  just the slight vibrations from the sump pump running was causing the ghost cycling.  On Tuesday I moved it to another part of the utility room and put the cutting board underneath it directly onto the cement floor and have not had one ghost cycle since.

So in short, my PSA after using the LR4 for about 6 weeks is it is SUPER SENSITIVE, so possibly even if your LR4 is on a 1st, 2nd, 3rd floor etc, if the floor just moves slightly sometimes to people in the house, things being moved around, etc I will cause the LR4 to sense something which then triggers the unit to cycle.  In the 2 days I had the LR4 on plywood spanning the underground sump pump, it probably ghost cycled 40-50 times.

In all of those 40-50 times never once in the ‚Äòrecent activity‚Äô did it ever log anything I saw so from the ghost cycling perspective it doesn‚Äôt help with troubleshooting.

Additionally, they may need to put out a firmware update so it isn‚Äôt so sensitive?!?  Don‚Äôt really know what the fix will be but not everyone has a solid cement level floor to put it on.

So in short, it the LR4 isn‚Äôt perfectly level and near any type of vibration it‚Äôll contribute to the ghost cycling.

Just wanted to share this information to help everyone in this sub!

"6 plant based litters that work with the litter robot, and which works the bestDISCLAIMER: Litter Robot does not advise the use of plant based litters in they LR3 due to the potential for moisture build up on electronic components. In their FAQs they recommend cleaning more frequently to avoid this condensation, but do be aware you do this at your own risk. 



So I've gone through an ordeal trying to find the best plant based litters that work with my litter robot 3. I formerly used okocat in my traditional litter box and while it was a perfect litter in that setting, it doesn't work with the litter robot. I personally hate clay litter so that was immediately out for me, I don't like that they strip mine for cat poop sand and I dislike how it's dusty and I've never found it does well with odor. Just my opinion, but this is why I'm offering my experience, in case anyone feels the same as I do. 

1. Sustainably yours multicat (red label) 

This stuff clumps like a dream and doesn't stick at all. Unfortunately it doesn't do great with odor and I did have a fair amount of tracking (I don't mind a little tracking, it's kind of to be expected in my opinion) as the LR is in my bedroom I couldn't deal with the smell. 

2. Sustainably yours multicat plus (purple label) 

Pretty much the same issue as the red label, the odor was not well managed and I decided to try something else

3. Grass seed (so phresh brand)

Clumps well, but sticks to the liner and smells about the same, not even like ammonia, just weird. Not a favorite

4. Naturally fresh ultra odor control (yellow label)

Works wonders for smell, unfortunately it's dusty and sticks. Also, due to my main LR using cat being all white, he'd frequently have dark brown dust on his feet and his eye corners. 

5. Naturally fresh quick clumping (green label)

Same pros and cons as the other walnut litter, it sticks and is dusty. Even with Litter Care, both walnut litters stick.

6. World's best cat litter multicat (blue label, lotus blossom scent. It was on sale and my cat isn't picky)

I've used worlds best before, and I never really had too many gripes with it. It clumps well, doesn't stick, though it can mold if you're not careful. Truly I can't even tell that this litter is scented either, so it's not super overly perfumey which I dislike. It is a bit dusty but the dust doesn't seem to stick to my cat nearly as much.

All in all, world's best is my current top pick for a natural litter. Do keep in mind your mileage may vary, and since my cat has decided that he no longer has to squat to pee, that could definitely contribute to the sticking issues I experience. If anyone has any other recommendations that I could try, I'd definitely be down, especially if they're available at a petco. I should add that my boy is not a picky pee-er, so changing litter like this truly doesn't bother him."
"LR4 won't weigh cat and other issuesI've put in a support ticket, but fairly certain I won't get a response anytime soon, so figured it's worth asking here. 

After setting up the LR everything in terms of the machine itself seems to work fine. However, the app control basically doesn't work at all. I can't change any of the settings (cycle delay and light) from the app. It says it has a firmware update, and I've pressed it many times and nothing happens. I've unplugged the unit multiple times. I've re-boarded multiple times, nothing works. 

The most annoying thing is it doesn't weigh my cat. Paid $700 for this product, it's pretty annoying that this isn't working. Any ideas what I might be missing to get it to grab a weight?"
"Are You Upgrading?I have a LR 3 that I think I bought \~4/5 years ago. It's had its fair share of the standard 3 problems: that f\*ing pinch sensor, thinking the drawer is full when it isn't, not registering poor Lothar... 

But I've lived with them all for several years at this point and the thing isn't DYING by any means, so I'm curious: fellow LR3 owners, are you upgrading?

"Does This Work for Chonks?I have 3 cats, and 2 of them are chonky boys on diets (18 pounds and 13 pounds). I have large litter boxes now, and they sometimes get pee on the mats under the boxes because their big bums hang over the edge. I‚Äôve read that the inside dimensions are fairly small, and some cats might not be able to turn around or fit comfortably. Does anyone have big kitties who use the robots? Are the robots large enough for big kitties to get into and actually use? I don‚Äôt want to pay hundreds of dollars for something my cats can‚Äôt even use."
"Issues with lr3 and can‚Äôt get company to respondMy mom bought a lr3 due to failing health. I cannot get the box to work even without app set up.  Will not connect via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. Can‚Äôt setup robot.

I‚Äôm fairly techie and have used the lr3 personally for some time now. 

I have spent hours trying to help but they won‚Äôt respond to emails. Now it‚Äôs too late to return.

What gives? I know they are busy but this is absurd. Anyone have a direct line to the company?"
"Constant yet intermittent torque faultsHello robot enthusiasts! 

I'm not certain this yet reaches the level of requiring tech support, and it seems they're overwhelmed at the moment anyway. So I'm wondering if anyone out there has any tips.

I've had the LR3 since March and it has been absolutely wonderful. Perhaps a month ago, I began seeing some torque faults, but it wasn't apparent what was causing this. Maybe once was a cat interuption as the litter seemed more scattered than usual? But I removed the globe and found some litter in the base. Cleared that and it seemed to work splendidly again for some time. But now the torque faults have started up again, and even after clearing out the base in the same manner again the faults continued. It's not always, but fairly often that it comes up. I haven't noticed any noise or unusual movement so I'm not certain what exactly the problem would be! 

I did find a video showing how to replace the motor. However I'm not sure if I can go that deep without voiding the warranty? Or is that something that would be a recommendation to check? I suppose it's possible some litter has made its way down to the motor, but maybe there's something more obvious I'm not thinking of. There doesn't appear to be any issue with the power supply, as I would imagine the lights would dim when it faults if that were the case. Or maybe it's so slight that I've missed seeing it. 

Anyways I'd like to try a few more things before bothering support, if anyone has suggestions! Thanks in advance."
"There's some (blue) light at the end of the tunnel (Review so far)Model: black LR4

Litter: sustainably yours multicat

\#cats: 1

location: bathroom, tile floor

ordered: early july

received: late august

I've been trouble shooting this pretty much since I got it one way or another but I had some confounding variables.

Issue A: Cat had some trouble adjusting to the LR. confounder: I was adjusting him to it at the same time we moved into a new place so that definitely contributed to him taking his sweet time. It took about 3 weeks for him to start using it exclusively.

some things that helped him to adjust were:

\- keeping the litter robot off for the first few weeks, and manually cycling it. Gradually exposing/conditioning him to the cycling (i started by first only cycling it with the door closed, then cycling it with the bathroom door open, graduated to cycling it in front him while giving him some pats and a treat.

\- Dr. Elsey's cat attract  litter additive

\- praising him when I saw him use it (he's a people cat so this works, YMMV)

\- tossing a lumps of pee from his old litter box into the LR

\- not cleaning the old litterbox

&#x200B;

Issue B) a million cat detection alerts/ phantom cycling: updating the firmware did help with this thankfully for the most part. This still does occur multiple times a day but it's dramatically reduced. It was cycling like more than 20x a day before and now maybe it does that 5x.

Cleaning the sensors with compressed air once in a while also helped with this.

I will say that some people in previous posts mentioned that the sensors may be triggered by floor vibrations. I live on the second story of an apartment building facing a fairly busy street so there are plenty of vibrations. Also kinda gross but the apartment I moved into has a few small roachies (hard to avoid them in the area that I live in sadly, despite meticulous cleaning). I've seen them scurry into the sensor port and set it off a few times. So if you have some unwelcome roommates in your own place, they may also contribute to this.

Issue C) Red light of death: again updating the firmware, turning on/off a few times, making sure the robot isn't on a grout line or touching any cabinet or walls has helped remedy this issue. Also I always turn the LR completely off when I refill the litter, clean it, empty the drawer etc. anytime I have to mess with it in anyway it's completely off which has helped keep the red light at bay.

So far this issue seems to have resolved.

&#x200B;

unresolved issues:

\#1) litter level often usually reads at low: confounder is that I suspect that the litter I use is lighter weight. It's kinda annoying but not a huge issue since I can visually see the litter level every day and top off as needed. Still debating on if I should change to another brand that isnt Boxie cuz dass expensive lol.

\#2) there's some odor: especially when it cycles and exposed the waste drawer to the air (understandably). I've added in A&H baking soda deodorizer with minimal improvement. May be due to the type of litter I use also. Regardless I empty the drawer every 3-4 days no matter the fullness and overall the smell is the same or less than a traditional box.

\#3) there was one time when the cycle got interrupted and the globe got stuck halfway thru sifting. I turned it off/on, tried manually triggering the cycle and it seemed jammed. I had to take off the bonnet and jiggle the globe to unjam it and get it going again. Luckily it was on a weekend, when I was home. If this had happened at work (I work long hours), it would've been a problem, and I'm sure I would've came home to some lovely pee on my bed.

HOPING & PRAYING this doesn't happen again especially when I'm at work one day.

&#x200B;

Overall: I'm content and I've been seeing blue bars mostly for the past few weeks.

It was a bit of a rough start, but I've seen improvement in performance, and am hoping future firmware updates will only make things run smoother. I do still feel like I'm figuring things out regarding cycling timing, litter to use, etc but I am a first time LR user.

I wish it didn't have such a steep learning curve, and honestly idk what I would've done without the support from this subreddit. Those things make this purchase sting considering the price tag. It should definitely have many of these kinks ironed out when you pay $600 for a litter box.

I would still recommend this if asked but with full transparency about my issues. If it was good to go out of the box I would sing praises."
"Newer litter robot 4 in the works? Also - how do kittens take to it?I am getting a kitten this year - I am on a waiting list. 

This kitten will be litter trained to use a standard box. I am wanting to invest in a litter robot so that the kitten gets used to it early on in life and hoping that the kitten will take to the litter robot. I know there is a manual mode for it while the kitten in small so my main concern is will the kitten take to it? I will have to buy the steps obviously as well but I'd hate to have to return it later due to shipping costs. 

Secondly - The litter robot 3 has been out awhile so I am wondering when or if we will see litter robot 4 this year or even next year? 

Thanks"
"LR3 AdviceI have a couple questions

1. Does anyone recommend a particular litter.  I feel like no matter what I use, I have an issue with pee clumps sticking to the bottom or poop getting smeared across the top of the litterbox when it cycles.  How can I make this happen less?  The purpose of the LR was to have a cleaner experience and it has been a bit of the opposite.
2. Mine LR is fairly new but I feel like I have a smell problem that I can't keep up with.  it's like the filter doesn't work.  Does anyone or did anyone have issues with smell?  What did you do?
3. There may be nothing I can do about this but my cat likes to jump into the box like it's a game and gets litter everywhere.  Is there a good way to keep it contained?

Things to note: 

Litters I tried - Arm and hammer, fresh step, scoop away (which seems to work the best)

I do use the Arm and Hammer kitty litter deoderant

I bought a refurbished LR3"
"Those who upgraded from a 2/3 to a 4. Truly worth it?My pinch sensor just went out on my LR3 non connect and this is the last straw I think. I have had issues with the pinch sensor since the first week but this time I am positive it is no longer the physical connection but something on the board. Between pinch sensor issues and the unit not registering my cats and the shallow waste basin, I am ready to curb this thing. The thing that kills me is that I don't even need the pinch sensor as my cats don't ever attempt to go near it when active.

All in all, I am fairly critical and disappointed in my unit.......but......the LR4 DOES have me intrigued somewhat. Are the pinch sensor, non registering cats, and waste basin issues fixed? If so, I might be able to be convinced that an LR4 may be worth it. Looking for honest feedback from non professional reviewers. Thanks.  


Also, do the official LR accessories like the steps work on the LR4?"
"LR3 Connect or wait for the backordered LR4?So I've ordered the LR4 on July 1st, at the time shipping was estimated by mid to end of August, from what I'm seeing, people who ordered in May are barely getting theirs (black model) and I'm assuming mine would probably not make it until end of September or October.

With that said, I want the LR because I travel fairly frequently and my cat's needs are entirely automated with the exception of the pooping situation, of which I worried about the last time I took a trip, and came back to a messy litter box area even though I prepared 3 litter boxes for the 4 days that I was gone during.

So from the title, is the LR3 good enough that it'd be good to cancel my LR4 order and get the older model? What am I really missing out on?"
"LR3 Shipping Times?My 6 month old LR3 died in late August/early September. After a fairly lengthy back and forth with customer service, they have ordered me a new base as it was still under warranty. Since Sept 27, it still shows the order as processing and not shipped yet? What has everyone's shipping times been like lately?"
"So far so goodHello! We‚Äôve had our LR4 for over 2 weeks now and we love it. Our 3 cats fills a bag every 5-6 days ish, the first week was more than that because we were getting them and ourselves adjusted so a lot of litter was wasted it seemed. It was fairly easy for our two younger cats (1 yr old and 3 months) to get adjusted, but our eldest did have to take some time getting used to it and bribing. We heard so many issues with people getting their cat to acclimate that we were worried we would fall into the same issues. Thankfully crisis averted and it‚Äôs been a real game changer. Have made friends and family interested in obtaining. Any sensor faults that we‚Äôve had have been because of too much litter, cats knocking the litter guard in the box, or the kitten continuously being naughty and disrupting it. Thankfully easy resets. At one point the kitten had confused the machine so we had to take the globe out and cycle ourselves because she was a relentless litter terror, other than that it‚Äôs smooth sailing. It doesn‚Äôt detect the weight correctly, but I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs probably because we do t have a solid floor . First time litter robot owner and I‚Äôm incredibly happy. Share your experiences so far."
"Any experience transitioning a cat to a litter robot they've ignored for years?We have two cats, and one uses the litter robot no problem but the other never got around to liking the idea. When we got it, we spent a lot of time trying to give him treats around it and even going so far as to give him treats on it (on a dish). We gave up and it's been a couple years I think at this point but because the other cat is a vertical pee-er (we've been to the vet - no issues, he's just a jerk), we really want them to both use the litter robot (so I'm trying removing the other litter box). I've seen the robot-shy cat get close, I even just saw him get in it briefly and paw at the litter (30sec total), but then seems to jump out fairly quickly and then use the restroom on the floor nearby where his old litter box used to be (maybe 10 ft from litter robot, facing it). Is this just a give it time situation or maybe is it hopeless and we're doomed to a terrible litter-box situation? As info, the shy-cat is smaller than the cat who uses it comfortably so it's not a size issue."
"Whisker login problemsI can't even log into the whisker app.  This appears to be a fairly common problem - so what's the fix?  I've been a huge advocate for litter robot, but this app is super frustrating."
"Why can‚Äôt I just block the vent?A thought- my litter robot STINKS even after I did thorough cleaning of the whole machine. I empty it fairly often (twice a week).

I noticed the smell is coming from, well, obviously, where the waste stays‚Äî the bottom tray. The filter doesn‚Äôt do anything (changed it twice already), and I do not want to empty it more often than I do.

So why can‚Äôt I just block the vent on the bottom tray, and instead of the useless filter‚Äî put the odor absorber at the bottom? My litter champ (better version of Litter Genie) does not smell, and it‚Äôs completely confined.

Does the robot requires air flow or something?




Edit: 
So I researched a lot of options, and did two things:
- bought the gel air freshener and placed it INSIDE of the tray (I did not block the vent, as people suggested, that it can grow mold).
- changed the litter to Boxie Cat multicat.

Our kitties have been using the robot as the usual, AND WOW I CAN BE RIGHT NEXT/IN FRONT OF THE ROBOT AND IM NOT REPELLED BY THE SMELL. If anything, I smell very very faint bit, but this is a game changer.

I am really really happy right now, and will continue to check in and see if it lasts!!!!"
"Used older model... still worth it or no?Hi All,

I've always thought about trying a litter robot because I hate keeping up with cat boxes but didn't want to spend $400+ for my cats not to like it. I stumbled upon one on FB Marketplace locally for $150 (it's been for sale for 3+ weeks though so they may take a lower offer.) It looks to be very old though - I'm guessing an original model of some sort.  


Are these old ones still worth picking up used or no? It does look like it's seen it's fair share of use:

"Cats getting dirty headsI‚Äôve noticed that my cats tend to brush their heads against the walls of the robot, which are often dusty or dirty around the waste port. 

I wipe the walls multiple times a day which is a pain in itself, but I‚Äôm seriously considering returning the unit. As much as I love it, this is making me reluctant to stroke their little heads which isn‚Äôt fair.

Anyone got any experience with this or advice? Thanks :)"
"Referral code and quick questionDoes anyone have a referral code that they wouldn't mind sending me?

I have been researching the LR for a long time now, and have decided to pull the trigger! Very excited, but also nervous on how the kitties will take to it. As of now, my cats are fairly young (2 years old) and healthy and have an on the ground litter box, do you think I should buy the steps or wait and see what they do? Any guidance is much appreciated! Thanks!"
"Anyone used to have a ScoopFree box? ComparisonI‚Äôve been reading through a lot of posts here and have found everyone‚Äôs experiences to be really helpful, so I‚Äôm hoping this will be the same for someone else! I‚Äôve had my litter robot for just about 2 weeks now and I am not happy with the smell. I have one cat. I‚Äôve tried the helpful suggestions here: switched the timer to 15 min, switched from the litter robot brand litter to Boxiecat red, added fresh wave odor gel to the tray, have dismantled and done a full clean of the box, even prematurely emptied and replaced the litter. Still, there is a smell I can‚Äôt stand and it feels like I‚Äôd need to empty the bin nearly daily to get relief. I catch a strong whiff of it at times, other times it‚Äôs not too bad. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment so I can‚Äôt place the robot somewhere discreet. 

I used the ScoopFree box with the crystal litter beforehand and I never had odor complaints. If there was an odor, it was clear that I had waited too long to change out the box. The litter robot definitely reduces the amount of litter that gets tracked outside the box and ends up elsewhere in the apartment. My cat also adjusted to it within a day. And it‚Äôs nice not to deal with stray crystal litter. But the scent is too much for me. I‚Äôm shocked that the ScoopFree system at like 1/4th the price was better. I‚Äôve spent quite a bit on litter these past 2 weeks, trying different things out, and now I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôm going to return litter robot. I think if you currently use the ScoopFree system and are happy with the odor control, you might want to reconsider the litter robot. Maybe in comparison to traditional boxes, it‚Äôs providing much more odor control and freedom from scooping. Also, if you have a lot of space and can place the robot away from high traffic areas then you might have a better experience. But if you‚Äôre used to a system like ScoopFree, you might be disappointed."
"removing old litter box when litterrobot errors every day?I think the biggest concern I have about removing the old litter box is that almost nightly, we have a cycle interrupt that leaves the (fairly new) litter robot in a state where the cats cannot use it. Is this not common? How are people overcoming this? Should I just return the damn thing while I still can?

Edit: Ok I spent a long time tracing through Nest Camera footage aimed at the Litter Robot to get to the bottom of this. The cats are no where near the unit when it is cycling. Mid-cycle, when the globe is almost completely inverted, the urine waste litter clump unsticks from the inverted floor and falls. This is when the unit goes into 'error' mode, presumably thinking that a cat tried to go inside during the cleaning cycle when actually it was just a really big pee in the clumped litter. It spend several minutes waiting, trying again, waiting, trying again. This time, it eventually reset itself (alerts of the interrupt at 6:57am, 6:58, 7:01, 7:03, and then ""cleaning complete"" at 7:05am) but often it does not correct/reset itself and I return to the litter box (hours later) with the globe still upside-down stopped mid-cycle.   


So, how do I fix this? Get a new litter? One of my cats has kidney disease (large amounts of urine) and the other is 20 lbs (large waste in general) so I can't exactly reduce the waste size itself. Is this really not happening to anyone else, where the waste sticking to the unit and then falling during the cleaning causes an interrupt (that sometimes eventually corrects itself but often does not)? "

"Message to CEOMr.  Zuppke,

Thank you for the recent message to your customers. It helps to know that you recognize you have a problem. I think most of your customers like the concept of your product and want to see you succeed. I personally have been a loyal customer for five years. I'm sure, however, that you can sense the level of frustration on this forum.

What would best address that frustration is more frequent, candid communication. The LR4 is undeniably flawed--or, at a minimum, unreliable--and seems to have been released prematurely. You must be working on fixes, but please let us know that. You are advertising heavily and presumably increasing sales while cutting back on customer support. That's not a good optic. It may help you get over short-term hurdles but risks damaging your reputation long-term. Moreover, continuing to send out faulty units will only compound your problem. 

You might be able to reduce returns and even support tickets if you would frequently reassure us that you're working on a solution to specific problems, such as the red bar of death, the frequent loss of WiFi connectivity, the overly sensitive sensors, or the globe getting stuck in an unusable position, to name a few. If some problems are insurmountable, it would be a show of respect to let customers know so that they can make informed decisions. Just communicate. 

Please. I have loved your products, the creative ingenuity of your ideas, and the excellent customer service you had in the past. Please make it all work again."
"My cats hate my investment. Help!So we have 3 cats. Obviously we're good candidates for the litter robot, right?
I bought one back in May. We had 3 foster cat at the time so I knew LR couldn't handle all that. We got rid of 1 giant box and replaced it with LR. So we had LR right next to our other giant litter box.
Things were so so. I avoided scooping the old box until absolutely necessary. I set up our ring camera and only 2 of the 6 cats would use it. I figured I'd have a long acclimation time until our fosters were adopted. Kept the old box nice and dirty to encourage things in the meanwhile.
Well the fosters are gone. We now just have LR. Now I have cats peeing in sinks and dog crates. Just this morning a cat shit next to the LR. Why

"Acclimation training in progress!2 years ago, u/DefNotAShark posted a comprehensive account of what worked for him to acclimate his scared cat. I followed it closely, although my cat isn‚Äôt as affection motivated as his. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a look to any new user. Both he and I had immediate success by physically placing our cats into old school litter boxes years ago. Both of us did the same with LR (though, admittedly, I did so much less aggressively because my cat doesn‚Äôt love being held as much as his). I also used a mixture of Dr. Elsey‚Äôs cat attract litter with her usual (Fresh Step w/ Febreze).

My LR4 arrived on Sunday, and today on Friday (Day 5), I have documented success! This feels like a huge victory because my 5 year old girl is highly skittish and can be resistant to change. She‚Äôs actually been using it for about two days (maybe 3?) now. 

I was paranoid that she wasn‚Äôt using it because I‚Äôve caught myself being absentminded and distracted during the last week, and I somehow convinced myself that the waste in it could have just been the few clumps I added from her old litter box, even though those clumps were clearly not in the same position as I‚Äôd left them ü§£. To stake her out and be sure, I was able to repurpose an old smartphone into a fully functional pet cam. (Shout-out to Alfred Home Security app, which is an outstanding free app!)

Next phase will be letting her see it run a cycle. Gonna keep cycling it whenever she‚Äôs not around for at least the next week or two. Maybe more. Terrified she‚Äôs gonna lose trust in it once she sees it move. On several levels: can‚Äôt afford to lose that sweet sweet progress!

What are your best tips/tricks to get him using it??

I‚Äôve followed everything on the LR website and the litter is the same, I added some from the old box too.

I ordered cat attract which comes tomorrow. 

I took the fence off just now in case that was dissuading him. 

I stopped cleaning the old litter box which is next to the LR but he‚Äôs still using it which makes me feel horrible, should I just clean it anyway?? 

Also just for additional context - new cat is very sweet and behaviorally good, but skittish and still getting used to humans - so we don‚Äôt pick him up and we are only able to pet him very occasionally when he allows haha.

I‚Äôve had the litter robot 4 for about a week and my one cat who is usually afraid of everything took to it right away with no effort on my part. She LOVES to watch it cycle even.

My big boy 20 pounder who is usually super brave hates the thing. I‚Äôve tried all the things -

Cat attract: I put practically a whole bag in there but he doesn‚Äôt gaf 

Stopped cleaning the old litter box: he peed on me while I was in my bed 

Removed the old box entirely: he peed on my bed again, this time not on me lol 

I‚Äôve been putting treats on the steps and around it and I‚Äôve even resorted to feeding him squeeze ups when he‚Äôs in it and to get him to go into it. He‚Äôs definitely more comfortable getting close to it/in it. 

I did get him to poop in it twice by picking him up and putting him in there. But no pee and he still won‚Äôt use it independently. 

I ordered the stairs you all recommend here and they come in a couple days. Hoping that helps. Is there anything else I should try? Am I doing the right thing with the squeeze ups while he‚Äôs in there? Will my bribery pay off? Lol 

Please help <3"
"plz help: yellow rapid flashing light for pinch detector/continues to rotate the wrong direction after emptyingi am very frustrated. 

every time i turn my litter robot on i get the yellow rapid blinking light. so i turn it off, take it apart, clean out the pinch detector area, put it back together and turn it back on like you see in the video. sometimes it still blinks yellow rapidly and i have to do the process again until it‚Äôll finally be the solid yellow light and rotate. on video i only had to clear it once before it rotated. 

then it keeps rotating after it empties until it seems to get itself off track, and the yellow light starts blinking rapidly again. ugh. sometimes after it empties it will rotate normally back to the solid blue light, but it never lasts more than one more rotation, and then it‚Äôll get stuck in the position seen at the end of the video. my cats obviously won‚Äôt use it that way, so i‚Äôve been having to keep it off for the most part and turn it on for manual rotations. it‚Äôs just been a huge hassle. 

i so appreciate anyone taking the time to read/watch and i welcome any help you might have. 

thank you.

"Finally Asking for HelpI‚Äôll try to keep this concise. Have two boxes, neither connected correctly. 

LR4. Six weeks old. Love it. Everything works perfectly EXCEPT that WiFi stopped working after a week. The light bar remains blue, with a blinking WiFi light. (No help site mentions this light config).  Things I have tried:

Deleting robot and reinstalling from new. Worked for an hour then connection gone again. 

Stepped network down to 2.4g. 

Rebooted EVERYTHING by powering on and off. 
 
LR3.  Bought used a month ago. Also works perfectly except cannot get it to connect at all. Furthest I get is to the step after I‚Äôve connected to the ‚ÄúLitter Robot‚Äù network, and then entered my own network/password after being prompted. Then it just endlessly tries to connect to my network but never does. 

Have tried the setup process a dozen times.

"Litter Robot 3 Cycling HelpHi all, I don't normally partake in this community since I am allergic to cats.. Lol. However my GF is getting really frustrated with her LR3. She took the globe portion apart to clean it. I helped her reassemble it and when she goes to cycle it. The red blue and yellow lights flash simultaneously. We double checked the leveling sensor, made sure the dome was assembled properly, etc..

However, when the dome goes to cycle there is a click sound. The done seems to rise inside the bonnet and it gets caught up. The track is clean and free of any debris... like I states earlier, I am no expert in this so I am trying to assist her as best I can. We are both at a loss, are we missing something? 

I am willing to ask her more questions and provide any answers ASAP. 

Thank you in advance.

Edit: there is a plastic fin near the opening on the dome to remove the little... what is that for and why does it protrude? Should the dome start with that facing down?"
"Please help! LR3 Connect issuesI am in need of desperate help.

My litter robot 3 connect quit working and just the yellow light was flashing rapidly. I looked and read the manual and thoroughly cleaned the pinch sensors and DFI sensors. Still nothing worked.

Then I went ahead and ordered new pinch and DFI sensors kit on the the LR website. I received it today and installed it correctly a couple of hours ago.

I turned it back on and it acted like it was going to work and started cycling for literal 10 seconds and then stopped and started flashing yellow but slower than before. Then when I hit reset it switched to a flash red light and I got a notification on my phone about a bonnet error. So then I looked up how to fix that. And I disconnected and reconnected the cat sensor located inside the base.

Then I couldn't get my app the reconnect to the litter box since it stopped 10 secs into a new cycle. So I logged out of the app and logged back in but now I can't even attempt to reconnect my app to the litter box because it wants to blue light on the power button flashing but nothing is overriding the other flashing lights. I have also tried hard reseting it like 10x in the last 3 hours on me working on it.

I still can't seem to get this litter box to work and the same lights are still flashing. Not together but they change when I hit reset.

I have taken apart and put in back to together probably 15x tonight and it's driving me insane.

Please someone help me if you can."
Help!I have two cats and one of them keeps peeing outside the box. Basically she‚Äôs the box but sticks her butt out. Is there anything I can do to stop this. Thanks!
"Help after wiping down the back of litter robot it‚Äôs not turning back onHi, so I moved my litter robot to a new room and noticed dried cat pee on the back. I wiped it clean with a damp paper towel. When I go it all setup it‚Äôs now not powering on. The outlet is fine, I tested a nightlight there, and I get a hit from a voltage detector on the plug. I suspect I must have gotten some water into the barrel connector on the robot. 

Anyone have any tips on what to do here?"
"Help - LR4 dumping litter into back of baseIs anyone else having an issue where their LR4 will dump litter into the back of their base during the cleaning cycle? 

I actually witnessed the litter rolling out behind the drum during the cleaning cycle when it had reached the position where the litter tray was fully exposed. Not sure where the ‚Äúleak‚Äù is but it‚Äôs definitely on the backside.

We are using the Arm&Hammer Clump & Seal Platinum litter and LR already sent us a guard for the front (doubted that would‚Äôve helped our situation but obliged as they are the experts). They had also replaced the base due to other recurring faults that they couldn‚Äôt remotely fix."
"Please help! new user here - so far not impressedWe have 2 1/2 year old male cat who is very anxious & 2 month old female kitten who is about 3-4 lbs. 
I was using biodegradable litter boxes with natural corn clump-able litter. I‚Äôd scoop 3 times a day usually & sweep up around because I‚Äôm not a fan of mats (robot vacuum can‚Äôt get over mats).
Got LR3 setup this past weekend. Has ramp with stairs that seem great. 
Male cat is really scared of it, but he has started using it when no one is looking. Kitten took to it right away, no issues. 
Since 1 cat is scared & kitten is too small for sensor, I have to leave off then turn on to cycle then turn back off. Every time it cycles, I have to tap the inner lining because the clumps don‚Äôt all drop. I‚Äôm still having to sweep up a couple times a day. The whole unit is covered in a fine layer of litter dust. 
Please tell me this is worth it?!  Can anyone recommend anything to help?"
Help - brand new litter robot 4 won't workI am about to lose it. I just got the litter robot 4 and I did everything the manual said to set it up. It won't connect to my phone though. It also won't spin. Like at all. The lights flash as if it's cycling and I can hear it running but it won't spin. I spent so much on this to have it not work immediately is incredibly disappointing. Support has not responded and their phone line isn't working. For an $800 litter box I expect more. Can anyone help me figure out what is wrong?
"Cat peeing and pooping outside the box. Please help.Had the LR4 for one week now. 3 cats. I *think* all of them are using the robot because I get 3 different weight readings on the app, and because the waste drawer was full and ready to be changed last night, I think that sounds about right for 3 cats. Cycle is set for 7 minutes. 

Now one of them, don‚Äôt know which, has started peeing and pooping on the floor/furniture starting a few days ago. Completely ruined a chair in the living room. The old box is still available to them. And I‚Äôve been cleaning the old box daily, even though you‚Äôre supposed to let it get dirty, because I wanted to avoid them destroying the house. Old box is near the robot. I don‚Äôt understand why this is happening especially since they can still use the old box if they want to. Please help."
"Help with pinch detectorHi! So I am so over the litter robot 3 pinch detector. It caused me so many problems. I watched a million youtube videos and tried a million different hacks. I finally ordered a completely new pinch detector and DFI kit. I changed it all out, it was working great for about a month. Now these past few days I am back to seeing the pinch detector alerts. I absolutely despise having to open the litter robot and have probably about a good 10x now. I‚Äôve had the litter robot 3 for 3-4 years now. With the NEW pinch detector, why the heck am I still getting these alerts now after about a month? The last thing I want to do is open it up again. üôÉ Soo over this thing. Thank you!"

"Cleaning help TvTI got a LR3 for 4 months now and love this free-from-scooping life, but I have a small(?) issue. 

My cat gets diarrhea from time to time ; . ; he has medicine for it but sometimes when he gets stressed (just me touching grass or going to school T . T) or ate a bit of dog food when I'm not looking, his stomach gets funky and in return, the LR gets a bit messy inside...so I end up washing the whole thing almost every week or 2 weeks.

Is that alright? Or will washing it that often make it deteriorate faster? Should I just wipe it down and wait for like a month before I deep clean it or something? Also may I ask how do you guys normally clean it? I'm worried that I'm a dumbass that's been doing it wrong. I hose it with water, bathe it with dishwashing soap and brush inside till it's all clean

Gosh I feel so dumb asking help for this lmao"
I can't figure out what this part is. It fell out of the Litter Robot 4 when changing litter bag. Anyone know? Manual is no help.
"Cat pooping on floor instead of Litter Robot - plz helpI‚Äôm needing some advice for our cat Poppy who is pooping on the floor instead of in our Litter Robot. We‚Äôve had the robot for 3+ years and our 3 cats have loved it, until recently Poppy will pee in the box but won‚Äôt poop in it. I think it‚Äôs because her butt hangs out of the box, and her poops fall out of the box and down the steps, which stresses her out. Our other two cats are smart and face their butts to the back of the robot, Poppy isn‚Äôt the brightest kitty and doesn‚Äôt know to turn around. 

I moved the robot to a different room to see if it would reset her brain, it did work and she tried to poop in the box but the poops went down the steps and now she is pooping on the floor again. I blocked all the spots she tried to poop and closed the doors to all rooms except the litter robot room, now she is just walking around holding all her poops in.

Any advice to get her to use the box again, and to get her to turn around? Putting her in the box hasn‚Äôt worked as she won‚Äôt use it if I‚Äôm in the room with her."
"IDK what to get send help!(srry for long)

Hi i have two little babies, brother and sister, almost 1 year old! i was considering getting an automatic litter because cleaning litter is the bane of my existence (given my adhd and other health problems i often forget to clean it and when i do it is somewhat physically demanding for me). 

however this is also a very very expensive investment so i wanted to ask what differences between LR3 ($499), LR3-connect($549), and LR4 ($699) need to be considered beyond just the price? also are there any other robots that are cheaper but still good? 

also given that it is a machine what are concerns with mechanical or software failures or improvements? is it harder to fix LR3 bc it is older/less common? does it make more sense to invest in LR4 because it is the current focus of the company?

idk if this matters but if it does: a little about my kitties, they are very chill and friendly with each other, they tend to make a mess outside the litter bc they dig and swat at the litter after and it gets out of the entrance (i think it‚Äôs just one of them but i never catch her in the act). i don‚Äôt think them getting acclimated will be an issue, they are pretty chill and are actually amused/intrigued by my vacuum(?). they are approx 10 and 14lbs per my best guess."
Just received my first LR3 and need some help that I can‚Äôt find an answer to online.I have 2 8 month olds and they have used Feline Pine CLUMPING litter ( not the pellets ) since I got them.

Thanks
"Help - Pinch sensor / rapid blinking yellowI came home from a trip, fired up my Litter-Robot 3 (no wifi, off warranty) for my little guy, and I got a slow blinking blue light.  I hit reset, and it changes to rapidly blinking yellow.  Reset flips between the two kinds of blink; and hard resets like power on/off or unplugging the unit don‚Äôt change anything.

Fast forward, google says that this is a pinch sensor malfunction.  I‚Äôve disassembled the unit and cleaned the metal pinch sensor arms; I‚Äôve bent the
arms back into contact,and I‚Äôve tried taping/zap strapping the arms together to bypass the sensor.


No luck so far.  I‚Äôm incredibly frustrated.  The only next move I can think of is to trying to connect the sensors together at the wire, prior to the arms (skipping them completely), or order whole new arms.  Unless the board is damaged and I need a whole new DFI assembly?

I‚Äôm at a total loss for ideas on what I can try to troubleshoot wether it‚Äôs the arms, or something else in the wire, or something else completely in the unit and how deep I have to ordering replacements.

Help liner on litter robot 4 is rippedThis freaking sucks man. I deep clean it twice a month and I find this. I have only had this since November. Duct tape and glue will not work:/
"Has anyone added any more weight to the preinstalled metal weight on the underside of the LR3 rubber liner to help the bottom ""flop down"" when it cycles?I've noticed that over the last few months, the rubber bottom of my LR3 has stopped flopping down to help knock off any clumped urine.  I did a deep clean of the whole thing today, but it still isn't flopping.  I got underneath the rubber skin to look at what the weight looked like.  There's nothing causing it to stick, and it wasn't dirty at all.  

I was tossing the idea around of taping a few lead weights to the existing weight to help the bottom flop down.  Anyone else ever try this?"

"Onboarding Help!Hi!!

I just recently purchased a new LR3 for my cats, this being our second unit. The whisker website recommends that for smooth onboarding of a second unit to unplug the first unit, reboot your modem/router, plug in the second unit, and begin onboarding.

"help with naughty catso to preface, i actually just got a leo‚Äôs loo too but there isn‚Äôt a subreddit for it and was hoping y‚Äôall could still help since the way they work is pretty similar ü•≤

i just got my box like three days ago, one of my cats took right to it. used it, jumped out, ignored it while it did it‚Äôs cycle. perfect little man. 

my other cat however is a menace. he jumps in it a thousand times while it‚Äôs cycling, i got a notification at work every 2 minutes that kitty was using it. i know it stops and starts back when he gets out and it‚Äôs usually fine‚Ä¶but the other day i woke up to it frozen with the chute down and all the litter hidden away and a notification of an ‚Äúobstruction‚Äù i knew right away that the obstruction had to have been pumpkin. turns out while it was in this position he noticed that there was a fun plastic bag through the chute and literally stuck his head in it and shredded it up. he also ripped one of the fuzzy things that help the globe rotate smoothly off the wall and it ended up in the litter drawer as well.

since then i have forgone the bags, figure i‚Äôll let him think they don‚Äôt exist anymore and then eventually start using them again once he quits messing with it. i also have switched it to manual mode so i can just run it when i‚Äôm home and keep an eye on him, but how can i train/encourage him to leave it alone? do i just have to wait for him to get bored of it? i really want to be able to switch it to auto mode so it can run on its own if we ever take a weekend trip but i‚Äôm scared of him causing it to freeze up without any available litter to use.

"Non Existent SupportHas anyone else been able to get a hold of support recently? 

I received my LR4 about two weeks ago and it was damaged in the box. The box was in great condition so it appears it was not packed well enough inside or broken before it went into the box. I then contacted support which said 1-3 business days, well so far its been 8 business days with no response. You would think delivery issues would get priority so as to not mess up first impressions.

This isn't boding great for a new customer to be ignored and despite my repeated attempts to contact them they have not responded. I feel the only way to get support now is to publicly air my problems.

"Help I did everything wrongThis is going to be a bit long. This is a confession of me getting flustered and doing poor litter box transitions. I absolutely recognize my cat‚Äôs behaviors is because of me

Last Saturday I setup my 1st Litter Robot. At first it started ok. Neither of the 2 cats were interested in it and would only use the old box. I got a bit disappointed and decided to change locations when my one cat started peeing on the machine, not in it but on it. I cleaned it up and closed off the old room and put the LR in a new location where I could see if they used it. 

One started to use it and one refused and literally went anywhere else. I got mad when he peed on my boardgame collection and once again moved the box. Now I‚Äôm back to square one again with neither cat wanting to use the LR. 

Is there anyway to salvage this or should I just send it back and forget about it?

"Constant issues with LR4 Please helpUpdate- I contacted support through their website because the click here link in the app wasn't clickable... Anyways they replied pretty quick and are sending a replacement base.  

I got the Litter robot 4 about a month ago and at first loved it.  I was hesitant to buy it based on the price but kept reading story after story of how great it is and figured I'd give it a try.  we have 4 cats and the youngest 2 took to it fairly quickly and with the exception of them constantly sticking their heads in when it was cycling causing it pause repeatedly, it seemed to work flawlessly.  

about a week later, all 4 cats have adjusted to it but now we start to have the same issues over and over.  One problem is that it constantly reports full after ever cleaning cycle.  with a fresh liner in place(and they are the LR4 liners) we might get one cleaning cycle where it doesn't report being full but by the second cleaning cycle it's flashing full.  during the day it's not as big a deal to be hitting the cancel button after each cycle, but overnight is always a problem and when we get up in the morning and cycle it, when the litter falls(usually heavy clumps) the unit stops and the light goes solid red.  this has been the second issue that is making me regret this purchase.  you can't cancel the red light like you can when it detects a cat.  the unit becomes frozen and nothing fixes it.  I tried unplugging it for a minute and then plugging back in and it goes through it's initial light sequences and then stops with a half green half red light bar.  ultimately the only way I can get it working again is by removing the bonnet and manually returning the globe to the start position.  I've been doing that multiple times a day and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't paid $700.  

I have researched all the tips and solutions and nothing works more than a day most.  we have it on a hardwood floor, level, not on a rug, not touching any walls.  I have removed the globe and cleaned out any stray litter. I have cleaned the sensors with a dry rag.  I have made sure the liners are on tight and not sticking out where they can get caught.  I also installed the newest firmware this week without any improvement.  I want to love this thing but all I'm feeling is buyer's remorse."

"Help: Our LR3 keeps throwing Over Torque Errors. We've found out this is because of the motor itself (and not because any other part is getting stuck) and wonder what to do nextHi Everyone, 

So, we have a Litter Robot 3 and have used it without issue for about a year before this.   

The LR starts a cycle, gets halfway done, just starts to rotate back around, but then throws and Over Torque error and doesn't finish. We can unhook the hood and turn it back manually, rinse and repeat. 

(We currently just empty it twice a day by letting it turn halfway by itself, turning it back by hand, and keeping it turned off the rest of the day, because we don't want to risk the LR getting stuck upside down while we're at work)   

To find out where the problem comes from, we've tried to let the LR cycle with the hood off, with the whole globe removed and then we even removed the motor ([this part](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot/parts/litter-robot-3-motor-assembly.html)) from its case, started a cycle while holding the motor in hand. 

In all cases, the cycle runs about halfway (longer if it's only the motor by itself), but eventually it stops, starts reverting, but then throws the Over Torque error(App Notification) and then stops doing anything.   

Since it happens in all cases, even when the motor is not mechanically connected to anything except for the electronics, we assume the problem is in the motor itself. 

* Has anyone here experienced a similar issue and solved it somehow?   
* Does this sound like we need to replace the motor?   

Before we buy a new one we might also try opening that part up and seeing if we can find anything mechanical that can be fixed, haven't gotten around to that yet 

Many thanks in advance for any help/tips!"
"Advice on helping my cat adjustI got the litter robot 4 over a month ago and my one cat who tends to be adventurous adjusted instantly. My other cat who is typically veryyy cautious has barely gotten in it. I tried the suggestions from litter robot, keeping the old litter box but letting it get dirty while putting some of the litter in the LR. I let that thing get filthy for probably 2 weeks and she still won't budge, just making BMs on top of the other stuff. She seems curious by it, she'll watch it as it cleans, she'll sniff around it. I typically sit with her when I notice she's getting brave to check it out and will give her pets. Does anyone else have any other suggestions, because this letting her old litter box get dirty isnt working for any of us !! My next thought is to take the old litter box away.

"LR4 getting stuck in the middle of cleaning cyclesWe're 30 days into our LR4 experience.  This is our first LR.  I hemmed and hawed for literally years about whether it was worth it to spend the money for something like this, especially since one of my cats is skittish and I was afraid she wouldn't use it.  I finally decided to give it a try (because of the 90-day in-home trial) and it did take a week or so to get the shy cat to use it, which I only accomplished by eventually taking away the old litter box altogether and hoping that didn't backfire on me.

&#x200B;

On one hand I've been thrilled with some aspects of the LR4 - I've noticed no gross litter box smells unless I open the waste drawer.  It's nice to not have to deal with scooping the litter box.  But that's really where the good things stop.  At first I was frustrated because the weight sensor is very wonky - it will show that my cats weigh 1.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, etc.  (They're about 9.5 and 11 lbs).  Then I read the weight thing doesn't really work if you have the LR on carpet.  I wish I had realized that before I bought it, but fine.  We're eventually going to replace our carpet with hard floors, so I guess I just won't worry about that feature not working.  Then I noticed that the waste drawer sensor seemed to be way off.  It will say it's 45% full even after it's just been emptied.  If we're supposed  to do some extra step to reset it after emptying the waste drawer, I'm not aware of it.

&#x200B;

But the most frustrating problem we're having is this ""cleaning cycle interrupted"" error.  At first when it happened I assumed that a curious kitty was getting into the LR after brother/sister had just used it, but then it happened when I was in the room and I realized it was throwing this error when there wasn't a cat anywhere near it.  Sometimes it will happen 5-6 times in one cleaning cycle.  Sometimes the globe gets stuck completely upside down (and empty, so not usable by the cats) and I don't know about it until I see it in that state.  If I'm home and I happen to see the notification on the app, I can go investigate, but I'm not always going to be right here.  I thought the whole point of this $700 monstrosity was that I could be more hands-off with it.  Several times now I've had to do a bunch of frustrating troubleshooting to get it to work again.  Tried a short press of the reset button.  That didn't work.  Fine.  Tried a long press of the reset button.  Tried manually starting a clean cycle from my phone.  Tried powering it off and back on.  Tried unplugging it and plugging it back in.  Tried emptying the waste drawer (that was not even close to full).  Eventually after cycling back through all of these things in random orders, I'll get it to complete the clean cycle, and then it will go back to normal use - until the next time.

&#x200B;

I've tried to reach out to customer service a few different times through the live chat on the website and by phone, but each time was told that it's outside of their normal business hours.  I sent them an email today and got an autoreply that they have a heavy email volume and it might take 1-3 business days to hear back.  Which is frustrating, because I'm going to be out of town for 3 days and my MIL is staying with the cats.  I really don't want her to have to troubleshoot this piece of shit, but I also don't want to get out the old litter box ""just in case"" and cause confusion for the cats that have already successfully transitioned to the LR.

Please, somebody tell me there's a fix for this, because I really don't want to have to send this contraption back and go back to the dark ages of scooping the litter box."
"Actually achieved somethingAfter 6 or 7 emails of me just asking for support to answer, over a period of 3 weeks, I finally got a replacement using my warranty. They sent me a brand new LR3. Long story short, invest in the warranty, prepare for a month for responses from customer service, and don‚Äôt bother calling. It‚Äôs always a 25+ person in front of you wait üòÇü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  

After all of this hassle, I still can‚Äôt get it to connect to the app üòÇüòÇ. It‚Äôs okay though it still does the job."
"Help Power CordSo the power cord on my litter robot 3 busted. Unfortunate but I just went on to order a replacement. And the last three days it won‚Äôt let me order it from the litter robot site (from Canada it keeps coming up about addresses). I‚Äôm fuming it‚Äôs sooooo hard to change the litter I‚Äôm going to have to go back to a box till I get the cord situated. 

Does anyone know where I can get a equivalent cord from Amazon or anywhere?"
Please help- these pillows were in the room with our litter robot. The cats have had just the robot (we removed the normal boxes after some overlap) for about a month now. What do we do?
"Has anyone purchased the new litter robot 4 fence? Did it actually make a difference?The photo is our current set up when freshly cleaned but every morning it‚Äôs the same routine of replacing one or all of the puppy pads because my senior cat keeps sticking her back end right where the current LR4 fence is and peeing all over it. Even with a normal litter box, she always thought ‚Äúoh my feet are touching the litter, I guess I squat here & pee‚Äù regardless of where her butt is. She‚Äôs old and tries her best so we just clean up any of her messes bc we love her of course. 

We found a temporary solution to cleaning less mess by placing puppy pads on the step & floor & it has helped but I saw there is a new fence/guard that is available to purchase but I‚Äôm skeptical. Has anyone purchased it and had success with their messy cat?"
"Terrible Customer Service and Fails to DeliverAfter seeing all the reviews that said emailing customer support would take weeks to receive a response I decided to brave the phone in support wait times. I was on hold for an hour and a half and finally made it up to 2nd in line for support before the service dropped my call. I immediately called back and was told (by a prerecording) that I was calling outside of their business hours, despite it being thirty minutes before their supposed closing time and the fact that I had called well over two hours before the end of business hours. Incredibly frustrating experience just to get help with the problems of the actual machine.

The robot itself does not work. It worked fine for the first month before requiring a manual cycle every time I wanted the litter to be changed. Then when I attempt a manual cycle, the cat sensor incorrectly goes off pretty consistently and the robot gets stuck upside down with the hole directly over the waste drawer, making it impossible for the cats to use. After wasting 30 minutes (daily!!) pressing buttons, turning on and off the machine, unplugging the machine, and consulting their manual for whatever color light indicator is flashing (and then consulting it again when the light color combo changes after following the instructions and it still not working) SOMETIMES the robot will reset to its original position before my cats use it and I start the entire process over again the next day. Additionally despite following all of the instructions for emptying the waste drawer (hitting reset after taking it out, etc.) the sensor constantly detects the drawer as being full despite it being completely empty. I ultimately just use a normal litter box in tandem with this machine which makes me wonder why I paid as much as I did in the first place if I‚Äôm still scooping litter and constantly trouble shooting a finicky, sensitive, and useless device."
"LR4 OfflineLast month, my LR4 went offline after an internet outage. The unit itself continued to work, but stopped connecting to the app. I contacted support and they sent me a new base which I have had for a week and a half. 

The new base was working great until it randomly disconnected yesterday and I can‚Äôt get it to connect again. All of my other tech (smart thermostats, phones, computers, TVs, etc.) are still connected to the internet, but even after hard resetting the LR4 and restarting my router, I can‚Äôt get the LR4 to connect to the app again. The last light is now solid white and I‚Äôm at a loss."
Repeating bonnet removed errorI keep getting this error. It eventually completes the cycle but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing this or how to fix it. It seems to be firmly attached and I don‚Äôt see any debris but it‚Äôs really annoying. Any help would be appreciated.
"how to prevent cat from kicking litter out of litterrobot?I have a litter robot 3 and every time my cat goes to do his business, he starts kicking the litter out of the litter robot and sprays it everywhere. I bought a litter tracking mat but it doesnt seem to help. How can I prevent my cat from kicking the litter everywhere?"
"New LR4 large fence!I ordered one the moment it got listed.  It's been on for a couple days ago, this appears to work well to guard against urine entering the lower front area in front of the globe.  We love it so far, cats aren't peeing out of the box any more."
"Owner of a Litter Robot for 3+ YearsDisclaimer - this is a rant post because LR disables comments on all their social media posts (I wonder why?!?)

Went all in on this product. The whole kit. $800+

100% serious - biggest waste of money and my biggest regret in terms of purchases.

The thing *constantly* faults and gets stuck in an unusable position. I‚Äôve done everything. Bypassed the trip sensors by taping them together, received 3 replacement bottom units and 1 whole ass litter robot after that. Still fails.

**This product is bad**, flat out. To be clear, the customer service people were great, so they aren‚Äôt to blame.

Please for the love of cats everywhere - do not buy this awful, poorly engineered product.

I bought this because I was sick of scooping crap, but at this point - at least I know a litter box won‚Äôt ever fail at it‚Äôs sole purpose of being a means for my cats to relieve themselves.

Don‚Äôt care to hear a defense of this product. If you‚Äôre someone who is looking into this product - **DO NOT BUY**"
Pretty Litter ? Pam?Anyone with 2 cats use Pretty Litter with their Litter Robot 4?  I currently use Arm & Hammer Slide. I have the timer set for 30 minutes. I think my cats just pee A LOT in one trip. Huge clumps end up stuck and miss the hole when turning. I just put on some Pam to see if that helps. Wondering how people like Pretty Litter? This may just solve the problem and no need for using Pam. Curious what others have to say about this.
"Considering purchasingHello everyone. I have 5 kitties and have tried every litter box I think is out there. My babies range from age 14 to 2 years. I have been considering making the investment on a LR4. Being a single mom and working full time - a self cleaning litter box seems like a dream!
Is it worth the investment? 
Thanks!"
"LR3 or LR4 for being out of town?Hi everyone! 

After spending hours in this sub (and elsewhere online), I‚Äôve decided to get a LR. The only question is LR3 or LR4? For a TLDR: feel free to skip to 6 & 7 below.

It seems like a gamble either way. And I‚Äôm willing to take that gamble at this point, but I would really appreciate users weighing in on which one they think is (or, even better, experience as) more likely to be less buggy. I know this is just getting anecdotal evidence, and the amount of variables in each report arguably make this ask counterproductive, but I‚Äôm asking nonetheless lol

The person I had lined up to handle my cat‚Äôs litter had to bail, so I‚Äôve gotta take the pricey plunge before my 10 day trip next month (Don‚Äôt worry, my cat won‚Äôt be alone! She lives with a bunch of people who have no problem feeding/watering/interacting with her. I just don‚Äôt want them to have to deal with her litter.) 

Some takeaways I‚Äôve gathered from my research:
1) Both LR3 & LR4 have their issues, and it‚Äôs ordinary to replace parts or entire units if necessary. That seems kind of like it‚Äôs part of the experience (which is not great for such an expensive product).
2) Fortunately, Whisker‚Äôs customer service is solid. 
3) Gradual acclimation and patience are likely necessary to train the transition. Including not letting a skittish kitty see cycling until she‚Äôs comfortable enough to use it. 
4) Proper maintenance goes a long way. 
5) Smart switches are not recommended by Whisker, but users report positive experiences with them in case of needing to manually power cycle while away. 

6) LR4‚Äôs waste tray has a slightly bigger capacity and is quieter, which is why I‚Äôm leaning toward it. 

I‚Äôm not sure about this one, but
7) LR3 has maybe had more time on the market to be less buggy than LR4?

I know there are a lot of LR3 vs. LR4 threads, but this one is meant to be geared toward the prospective buyer who‚Äôs gonna be out of town, and wants to take their best shot at the dang thing just working. Sincerely, thank you in advance!

Btw I‚Äôll gladly use anyone‚Äôs referral, especially if it comes with a helpful comment!"
"Should I get a 3 connect or 4?I currently have a PetSafe SimplyClean auto litterbox and it's awful. It's broken 4 times in a year and a half and now the warranty is expired. So rather than fix it again, my SO and I think we're just going to upgrade to a litter robot when it inevitably breaks again. We're just not sure if it's worth the extra money to get a LR4 over the 3 connect. I've heard the LR4 is buggier, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. Would love some insight from anyone who's had both or otherwise picked one over the other! Thanks!"
"LR4 and kittens?I'll be getting a 9-10 week old kitten in a few weeks so I'm about to order the LR4. Does anyone have experiences with kittens and the LR4? I worry that they'll have a hard time getting into the LR4 or won't find it intuitive. Would the stair accessory help? Or maybe it won't be a problem?

If anyone has experience with younger kittens and the LR4, would appreciate your advice. Thanks!"
"Senior cat setupI have two cats, a boy and a girl, and my boy (cat tax photo) is going to be 18 in a couple of months, bless his cranky, clingy little heart. While his arthritis is now under control thanks to solensia and he's getting around much better I made the choice to ""make his world smaller"" by reducing the distance between his usual hangout spot on the couch and the litter box and while not ideal for several reasons like noise interference and the occasional wafting smell it's enabled me to better understand how to help him use the LR with more confidence and comfort as he ages and I wanted to share in hopes that it could be helpful to other old cats and their families because it's helped us a ton. 

So, once i moved the LR a few months ago I noticed my old boy stumbling, often tumbling out whenever he exited the lr which turned out to be the main source of litter escaping the lr. My boy PW, he's a runt and has always been a smaller dude, he weighs around 7lbs and has always been a percher when using the lr and never fails to execute the ol' poop-and-run. Due to his size and pottying style he usually didn't activate the weight sensor which would result in uncovered stinks just hanging out until I cycled manually or my bigger girl cat came along, either way it wasn't ideal. I also noticed even with the ramp/step accessory he was having a really hard time with that first step out of the LR, his old man depth perception was struggling hard with that first big drop down out of the globe and that's when he'd basically tumble to the floor, poor dude. I considered the other ramp thing that a lot of people use and love but that also has a big drop off but it's at the end vs at the globe so that wasn't going to work for us, PW needed a gradual descent down to the floor no more than a few inches at a time.

After trying some other things that were just so-so I feel that I've found the best solution and it's so easy that anyone could replicate it with minimal effort if they so desired. The big solution? Cardboard boxes, two to be exact. I've included pictures which I feel are pretty self-explanatory so I'm not going to go into all the details but if anybody has any questions just let me know. I taped the boxes together with plain ol masking tape and used the rest of the rug I had cut up previously for the steps to cover up the cardboard boxes to give him better footing and I'm really happy to report that he no longer stumbles or tumbles getting out of the litter box and the amount of litter that's getting tracked out is way less than before.  My girl cat weighs 12 lb or so almost double what poochie does and it supports her just fine, takes up more space but imo it's absolutely worth it if it means he's not struggling to get in and out anymore. An added bonus is that he now sets off the weight sensor and it's cycling every time like it should, i guess the extra stability makes him perch differently now (no desire to figure this one out, it can remain a mystery :) )

Hope this helps some other cats and owners out there. One of these days I'm going to get around to spray painting the boxes black so they'll blend in. I had been waiting because I wanted to make this post and I am finally able to do so after doing a deep clean and am not ashamed to post pictures =D"
"Smell and reliabilityI have 2 Maine coons with most stinky poop ever.  I tried clumping litter, tide breeze system- smell is bad. ( vet is not useful, cats are healthy, just some more stinky than others)

I am thinking about switching to litter robot.

First question- will it help with the smell? I hope it will but I am not sure how big improvement to except. Is lr4 better model for stink?

Second - I read here a lot about issues with the robot. Is it the case what happy users don‚Äôt post or I need to expect to replace robot in a year?"
Why won‚Äôt my litter robot3 empty?
I was shipped a defective LR3. The base was replaced and errors remain. Now support will not reply. No not buy anything from Whisker.
Whisker / Better Business BureauI am getting no help or response from Litter-Robot/Whisker.  I have been very patient.  I am going to file a complaint with the BBB.
"Fence Problem and Always Full Reading Solved by Whiskers! Bravo!**I hope this can help many of you that are always facing these same 2 problems!**

Today I contacted Whisker about my LR4.  I am a long time customer who has owned every incarnation of the LR over the years. I used the chat feature on the website to contact them, and I was responded to within minutes by a really great rep. I was contacting them about 2 specific issues I had with my 6 month old unit (purchased January).

1. The fence was collecting litter on the outside and even urine if the cats faced toward the wall.

[Photo of the fence. Excuse the poop, as the unit had not yet cycled. LOL](https://preview.redd.it/enor6ehm2w1b1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e68c3a869587a5bd58e28510ba4f057e6c20d42a)

[Photo of the inside of the Waste Drawer.](https://preview.redd.it/e4zv61zk2w1b1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39c6d50c90fe322ab6c2fa0133c635ed7adcf150)

1. The unit continually said it was full even if we just emptied it. We had done the calibration a number of times to no avail. We used clear bags that fit the drawer perfectly.

Here is how they immediately resolved the issues:

1. I was asked to take a photo of the fence and the problem. After I did, they sent me a free newer shaped fence that would prevent the dilemma.
2. The rep asked me to open the waste drawer and take a photo of how the bag was sitting, etc. I snapped the pic, and she is sending me a new waste drawer for free. She said that the sensors are on the bottom of the unit, and that they discovered that some of them have failed sensors underneath. She also is providing me a free shipping label to return the problematic one after I get the replacement.

All I can say is that I had stellar care today by a company that saves me a lot of work with 3 cats--esp since I travel. Way to go, Whisker! A+!"
"Help! My cat won't let LR3 aloneMy cat is obsessed, truly and deeply with our LR3. She thinks it's a huge toy and will jump in and out trying to set off the cycle. She likes to attack the litter as it's being sifted damaging the liner. It has caused the LR3 to dump all the litter in the bottom tray and get it stuck upside down. I'm at a loss, we don't want to return it but not sure how to dissuade the behavior without scaring her from using the box? TIA"
"Needing helpI have a LR3. It worked fine up until a week ago. Now it is stuck with a rapid flashing yellow light. I‚Äôve torn it apart. Followed all the steps on the website. Replaced two sensors. Still the same issue. Can‚Äôt really afford to replace it and I‚Äôm back to scooping multiple boxes daily. Any suggestions? I‚Äôve tried contacting support, emailed them, no reply.

"LR3 DFI & Pinch issuesHi all, hoping someone can help me with this issue as I'm beyond frustrated!

I have 2 LR3s and an LR2. I LOVE my LR2 - she's around 18 years old and still works like a freaking champ, even if I do need to eventually get around to replacing the groaning motor :D My LR3s on the other hand... nothing but frustration. BOTH have the issue mentioned in the title. Power on and blue ready light flashes. Press reset and the yellow light fast flashes. I've tried bypassing the pinch detector on one of them (electrical tape trick after verifying neither tab has any corrosion), however the error still persists. Neither cycles at all. 

Whiskers is supposedly sending me a new DFI for one of the LR3s, and I've just submitted a ticket for the 2nd. In the meantime, I'm stuck scooping multiple normal boxes for a spoiled 6 year old & a 5month old who both think litter boxes should all be miraculously clean every time they enter... 

If anyone has suggestions for either bypassing the pinch detector and/or convincing the system that the drawer isn't full (a little funny, considering there isn't even a bag in it at this point!) that don't include replacing the DFI, I'd be incredibly grateful!"
"One of my cats won't use the box and I'm afraid of a UTII have 2 Siberians- an 8 year old and a 1 year old. My 8 year old has taken to the box just fine (other than interrupting the cycle out of curiosity). My 1 year old was apprehensive, but when we removed the old litterbox, he seemed to be better. He went 3 times with me luring him in with treats and toys, and even one time all by himself. But in the last 3 days he refused to go in at all. He pooped on the floor and did not pee for over a day. My husband and I were scared he would get a UTI so we put his old box back out (which is a jump-in style privacy box), and he's used that 3 times in just 12 hours. 

I'm thinking that the problem is he's a pretty big boy (15 lbs) and very furry. Two of the times he used the robot, he ended up with peepee fur around his butt, which never happened in his old box. I think this may have deterred him from using the robot. He's honestly a big dummy and just might not understand how to use it without getting dirty. Any tips to get him back in without risking a UTI?"
"Please help! Litter Robot 3 not working at all.The blue light is on and it‚Äôs looks like it‚Äôs perfect like that. But it will not work. I have to go and manually click the button each time. I‚Äôve cleaned the DFI lenses, I‚Äôve cleaned and taken everything apart and put it back together again, I‚Äôve hard reset it a few times and now it won‚Äôt hard reset again. It stopped accurately measuring my cat‚Äôs weight. I‚Äôve called litter robot but they aren‚Äôt too helpful. I called the store I got it from but it‚Äôs too late to return it. It was supposed to come with a 36-month warranty but idk what that would look at. Would my serial number be able to look up my warranty? Also please help?! How do I fix it???"
"Is there a better way to contact support then through whisker? They clearly just read through a script then never reply to you again. I thought the litter robot service department was supposed to be top notch, instead I get some horrible service farm that they contract out to.Thanks for the help folks.  The chat during business hours helped immensely."
"I'm pretty frustrated...So, I'm on my second LR3 Connect in the space of 3 years. The first just died, and it got replaced under warranty. The extended warranty ran out a little while ago, and don't you just know it, that's when all my problems began. First I got a pinch sensor error, so I replaced the little metal bars. No luck. Replaced the IR sensors, bingo! it started working again. For a couple of months. Then I got jam warnings. Cleaned it thoroughly. Checked for ""deposits"" everywhere, nothing. Support told me it was a motor proem but they didn't sell replacement motors so I could either spend $180 and let them fix it, or $299 for a new base. Sigh. But idly searching their parts pages lo and behold, I found they *do* actually sell replacement motors, so I bought one for $48 (funny, the free shipping only kicks in at $49...) and fitted that. Literally 2 minutes after fitting it I wasn't getting a jam error any more, now I got a cat sensor error. Double sigh. Bought a new cat sensor, fitted it, and I'm still getting cat sensor errors. I've had enough now. The thing has been offline for over a month while I ordered, waited for, and replaced parts. Support is about as useful as a chocolate teapot, and the thing is turning in to a real Ship of Theseus project. The only thing I can think of now is a faulty circuit board, and at $100 + all my time I've sunk in to this I just don't think it's worth it. So, before I consign this thing to a short life at my local waste transfer station, does anybody have any suggestions on what I could try next?"
"LR4 While away from home?Hello,

I travel a lot for work and can be gone anywhere from just overnight to up to 4 or 5 days sometimes, not to say I'm not at home a good amount of the time either. I've been looking at getting a litter robot 4 for my cat to make traveling a bit more stress free (My friend who comes to look in sometimes isn't available to come). Is it worth it and am I able to ""look in"" on the box while away from home and see the stats? Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated."
"Reconsidering my LR3C purchase, would be awesome if anyone can help me with these issues I'm having.I bought a refurbished LR3C and it arrived looking like new.

1st issue I'm having is the clicking noise it makes when cycling. I've tried pushing the sifter tabs and checking the liner but nothing has fixed it. I just haven't tried tearing the thing down. I'm just frustrated buying something this expensive would require me stripping it down to troubleshoot it.

I have 4 cats and these are other problems I'm encountering. One of them scratches the liner instead of the litter. Another one would hop in there as it is cycling. Two of them would hop in and out just for fun. This triggers the sensor and it would cycle even when no business was done. The app/LR would think it got filled even though there was no waste, which means the machine will stop cycling pre-emptively thinking its full.

I was also surprised by how small the litter tray is. The entrance is also very small and makes working/looking in there more difficult.

I'm definitely feeling some buyer's remorse. I would be returning if not for the return shipping fee and having to clean it completely after a couple day's use."
"LR3 won‚Äôt auto cycle consistentlyI‚Äôve been waking up in the morning and noticing there is pee/poo in my LR3 which discourages one of my 2 cats to not use the box (see cycle timeline pic). I‚Äôm not sure how this keeps happening and I‚Äôm looking for some tips. 

I‚Äôve verified the following already
- Pushing down on the unit does trigger the scale and the unit does auto cycle after whenever I do it
- I do reset scale after every litter change etc..
- I‚Äôm pretty sure the litter I‚Äôm using isn‚Äôt too light 
- Tried hard reset 
- Changed auto cycle timer to 3min (might change back to 7 to see if that changes anything) 

I‚Äôm wondering if one cat goes in, does their business and triggers the sensor. Then the other cat goes it and somehow prevents the auto cycle? 

Will the LR3 refuse to auto cycle if it detects a weight still inside? And shouldn‚Äôt it just auto cycle whenever that weight leaves?

Trying to troubleshoot, my one cat keeps peeing on the floor I need help bad üòÇüòÇ"

"Help! Pee‚Äôs against the back and leaks through.Hi!  I‚Äôm looking for advice.  One of my boys pee‚Äôs straight at the back of the LR3. Luckily it‚Äôs not out the door, but it manages to leak through to the outside of the globe because of this.  Is there a way to seal the seam or area around the key?  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre hope for the perpetrator, he does it in all litter boxes.  Covers are an absolute necessity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
"mundane positive LR4 review\- had a lot of trouble getting my cat to use the LR4 at first 

\- the switch back to clay based litter was a little rough (was on Okocat before) 

\- two sensor fault scares that... just went away. still a little worried about what happened there 

but other than that, I haven't had any issues with the LR4. it sits in my spare bathroom and I will forget about it until I get the drawer full alert, which is about once per week. I still like getting the notifications so I can check frequency and make sure all is going well in cat-bowels-land, but honestly this thing has been very pleasant and useful. with this and a simple auto feeder, I've been able to leave my cat alone for up to 4-5 day long weekends with no issues. her poops are absolutely demonic on the dry food required by the feeder, but that's a) my fault and b) resolved with the LR4 itself. 

just thought I'd leave some thoughts for other prospective buyers as I know usually we only post here with questions or problems."
HELP!!! - LR4 waste drawer will not zero out!!!! Still shows 40% full with empty bag in drawer (more details in comment)
"Should I give up and send the LR back?I bought one about a month ago. 1 (grey) cat refuses to use it (he‚Äôs against change so we‚Äôre working with him) my orange boy took to it after a short time. He used it regularly and we thought that‚Äôs great now we only need to work with grey cat. However recently orange has stopped using it and is going in greys box instead. 

Would like tips to help. Please note though complete removal or letting the regular box get gross is not an option at this time. I tried this and grey cat literally went anywhere else that wasn‚Äôt the LR.

Or should I give up and just get a refund"
"Litter Robot 3 Connect Wifi IssuesI FINALLY got my new litter robot to connect to my WiFi after hours of troubleshooting and searching on Reddit. I have Xfinity WiFi, and ended up having to separate my WiFi into two bands (5Ghz and 2.4Ghz) so the litter robot could connect to the 2.4Ghz.

The issue is now that my WiFi connection throughout my home is awful. We never had issues when the connections were merged and now can barely use the WiFi. My question is, since I got the WiFi connected, can I switch it back to the merged version or does it need to say separate for the litter robot to continue working? I tried to change the WiFi in the robot settings but it won‚Äôt connect. I saw a couple places that it only needed 2.4Ghz for the initial connection but not sure how that works moving forward. Can anyone share their experience? Thank you!!

- A very frustrated litter robot user"
"Sensor cleaning tip.So I'm on my third LR4s now.  My wife pre-ordered one so we got it at launch.  The first one had issues and was replaced after a month or two. The second was starting to get cycle interrupts. It wasn't that bad yet but after mentioning it on one of these reddit posts the CEO contacted me in a DM and they replaced that one. The third one has been mostly good until recently. It would occasionally have a cycle interrupt but after vacuuming the the sensors it usually fixed the problem.  But recently I've had numerous interrupts that don't reset by pressing the cancel button. Sometimes it would require the unit to be power cycled to get it to finish the cycle and a couple of times I had to manually rotate the globe because of a position fault.   Most of these issues started after I bought a big box of Costco brand litter that has way more dust than other brands I've used.  Wiping it down and using a hand held vacuum to clean the sensors didn't help much. But a day and a half ago I got out a q-tip and gently cleaned out the sensor holes and I haven't got a fault since.  It hasn't been long enough to declare victory but I figured I'd share this cleaning tip.  Also, I recommend low dust litter. After this giant box of Costco stuff is gone is back to Dr. Elsey's."
"Brand New LR4 ErrorsOur one week old LR4 is nothing but errors, and I‚Äôm on the verge of returning‚Ä¶

Our cats took to the LR4 immediately which was great.

However, essentially about 25% of the time when a cycle is triggered, it is ‚Äúinterrupted.‚Äù I have observed this behavior as the LR4 is in our living room, there is no cat nearby. It happens at random points in the cycle, so there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason there. 

How the LR4 is set up:

-	On hardwood, with nothing underneath. 
-	Large fence attached, 3rd party stairs in front, about an inch away from the LR4
-	Using Boxie Pro litter
-	Firmware up to date

What I‚Äôve tried that doesn‚Äôt work:

-	Cutting power to the LR4 via smart outlet. When it powers back on and goes through it‚Äôs colored test lights, it goes straight back to red. It will not cycle via buttons or app, completely frozen in an unusable state.
-	Factory resetting the LR4, and reinstalling the app.
-	Trying different litter levels, both just above and below the fill line.
-	Using the reset button until the status light turns white, to reset the scale.

What I‚Äôve tried that temporarily works:

-	Cleaning the sensors. If I get all the way in there and wipe the sensors, vacuum the sensors, and/or use a little alcohol on a qtip, that allows the LR4 to cycle. The problem is 1-5 cycles later, we are in the same exact boat.

Since the cleaning of the sensors temporarily fixes it, seems like that‚Äôs the issue. However when I clean the sensors, I don‚Äôt see and dust or hair on or around them. The daily errors are excessive, and I can‚Äôt rely on this thing if I need to be around to clean the sensors so often. They seem way too sensitive.

Please help! Any insight is much appreciated!"
"Help, my cat waits to poo/pee until the cycle startsWhen my cat has to go to the bathroom he doesn‚Äôt go until he hears the cycle start. The low humming sound the robot makes while cycling is like a reminder to him as if he wasn‚Äôt thinking about going then but ‚Äúnow that you mention it, I could go!‚Äù

When my cat hears the cycle start, he rushes over, peers his head in interrupting the cycle, and then gets in to do his business. At this point, the litter grate is already on the bottom and the litter pile is off to one side of the globe because it was mid-turn, so he directly poops and pees into the grate underneath him with little litter to impede the waste from getting stuck in the grate. The waste gets stuck to the grate or walls making manual intervention mandatory and cleaning needed more often. 

Anyone have any suggestions to get my cat to only go when the cycle isn‚Äôt running? Thanks in advance."
LR3 Won‚Äôt Go back to Home - Please Help!
New Kitten & LR adviceI‚Äôm about to press add to cart on a litter robot 3; we are expecting our new kitten in approximately two weeks. He does not currently use an automatic litter box. Do you think I should stick with a regular box to begin with and then transition or just get him right on the litter robot to start? The reason we are looking at this option is because my kids want to help care for the kitten and it‚Äôs more realistic for us to go with this option versus a standard litter box! Thanks?
"Litter Robot 4 Poop ChuteHello! My LR4 has finally arrived and I am looking it over before setting it up. I am just outside of hours to chat with a Whisker technician so am hoping this community might be able to shed some light!

I attached a couple pictures of the hole where the waste goes through. There is a thin styrofoam strip that appears to go around the outside side of the hole to offer some mild support with preventing muck from getting into the lining of the globe. Its sticky backing does touch much of the plastic around the hole so litter and grossness will definitely stick to that. 

Is this how it is supposed to look? To me it makes sense to put a silicone liner over all of that, that could be cleaned off when needed. To me this looks like an area that will get gross fast. I just wanted to make sure this is how it is supposed to look before I go setting everything up.

Thank you for your help!"
"LR4 Drawer Sensor IssueFor the last month my LR4 has started to act off by indicating that an empty drawer is anywhere between 30-50% full even when completely empty. 

I've tried compressing the bag to remove air but that doesn't seem to help. I've also tried shifting the drawer to redistibrute. There is nothing blocking the slot that empties into the drawer.

I''m now having to change the bag every 2 days versus 1x/week in average. Any advice?

I have contacted Whisker about this multiple times but only receive a canned reply not addressing the issue so I'm at a loss. I changed it this morning and it's already at 85%, which is beyond frustrating and defeats the purpose of having the device."
"Still not receiving notificationsI have tried numerous times to get my LR3C to send notifications. I have sent emails, texts and spent hours trying to figure out why I suddenly a few weeks ago stopped receiving notifications. I called on Monday (4/24/23) and was 67th in line. When I finally talked with a customer rep, he deleted my litter robot and we tried to set up again. Went thru all the steps and tried to connect and the wheel kept spinning. He told me to get out of the app and he asked me to hold on while he consulted someone about the problem. I held on for another 35-45 minutes and hung up. I have received no call back. Customer Service with Litter Robot used to be amazing. Now it sucks. Please help!! I need notifications so I know if there is a fault. If one of kitties get injured when trying to use the litter robot, if it is hung up and I'm not aware of it, I'm holding your responsible. Yes, at this point I am angry and frustrated."
"DIY help/suggestions/rantHello,

I am now on my second replacement lr4 base and am still running into issues. Particularly with wifi, although I get the annoying sensor faults almost every time it cycles. Although, it completes the cycle. It just pauses halfway thinking there is a cat when there isn‚Äôt. The more annoying thing is the constant dropping from wifi. I have a very good wifi setup(Ubiquiti), and all of my other ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices like the numerous esp‚Äôs connected to HA are hanging out and doing just fine. The lr4, and also the feeder, just struggle to stay on connected. According to my network, the lr4 is still connected when it goes offline in the app, but it is pegged at 100% so something is messed up. 

Anyways, the above is stuff I have all already ranted about. I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has dug into their $700 lr4. I am at the point where I‚Äôm fed up and about to just rip this thing apart to attempt a DIY solution. Like all the sensors must be able to be read from, unless they snap some kind of pic and send it off to the cloud for ai interpretation? Idk would anyone be interested to dive into this with me and potentially make a diy open source board with an esp32? I am sick of this cloud nonsense and I feel that all the issues surrounding the lr4 would be solved if the firmware was made open to the public. The ability to disable sensory would be a game changer‚Ä¶ And save whisker from sending me a 2nd replacement base for an issue that will likely not be fixed."
Cannot Resolve this LED codeThe litter robot 4 just had its base replaced and still the same error persists with 3 solid white LEDs and 2 flashing yellow. It seems the motor attempts to move but it doesnt budge. The globe is clean and the tract on the back is secure. So it has to be something with this globe then? The most frustrating part is there is no mention of this LED code in the manual or online. Any help much appreciated.
need helpMy cat keeps scratching the sides of the inner walls in an attempt to cover her mess. Anyone else have this issue? Or any ideas how to solve this tape will leave a ton of residue so I don't want to do that.
"The secret to a smell-free litter robotEverything I did didn‚Äôt do anything to help the smell until I replaced the rubber liner in the box. I can now be sitting directly next to the box and not smell anything. This is such a game changer and I‚Äôm wondering why this isn‚Äôt talked about more! Figured I‚Äôd share to help out others!

Edit: This is for owners with older robots. My LR is over 3 years old so this won‚Äôt apply to everyone. I had fully taken it apart and soaked it in various enzyme Natures Miracle products for days, spraying every other hour, then a full Lysol disinfectant soak for a day; unfortunately after all that work the smell still was there."
"I really want to like the LR4 but it's making my life harder not easier.I'm seriously wondering if a regular litter box was just better and considering returning the LR4. I really want to like it, but it has been giving me major anxiety and worry recently. Here's why:

TLDR: The smell from the waste bin has seeped into the plastic of my litter robot globe, drawer, and base. The smell is horrendeous when it cycles. My cats pee on the sides instead of into the litter which makes me think they're cramped and they like to go one after another so they either dont get clean litter (longer clump time) or an unhardened, moist clump is dumped into the drawer making it even stinkier. It really feels like the old box where clumps were covered  had time to dry and harden was more sanitary than the LR4. I'm trying one more deep clean and a more often bag switch, but otherwise, I'm ready to send this thing back. Comment whatever your thoughts are, helpful or hateful.

1. The waste smell has seeped into the plastic of the LR4. SERIOUSLY WTF? Not only through the bags and into the plastic of the drawer, but also into the plastic of the base of the LR4, specifically the part of the base that sits right above the drawer opening and is curved upwads to support the globe. The smell has also seeped into the globe behind where the carbon filter sits. This apperently hasn't been a problem with anyone else in this sub...?

(My cats do not pee high, no pee gets into the base, bags are fully intact, the filter is present.) 

2. The clumps truly never dry......... they never get fully submerged in litter for a long enough time to dry out before being dumped. So they get dumped and sit there marinating in the drawer. This is the same smell that is seeping into the plastic of the LR4, but this stench is also released every time the robot cycles. ü§ñ  It's truly gross. Mostly nobody here has a problem with a box full of cat pee and poop just sitting in their house..? This was my initial hesitation, but i decided to give it a shot anyway. (Yes, i add deodorizers, litter, and baking soda to the bottom and all that, but wasn't the point that I didn't have to do that)

3. Is this thing actually big enough for cats? Yes, i understand some people have really large cats using it without a problem. But there is much less litter than the traditionally recommended 4in of litter for an enriched litter box experience.  My cats get in and dig (there's nothing to dig tho) and end up peeing on the walls and edges (not high enough to seep into the base, tho). I can't help but think they're super cramped. 

4. My cats go one after another, without enough time for the litter robot to cycle in between their visits. And because the level of the litter is low to begin with, they're digging in clumps compared to their old box. The longer wait time has been suggested to let the litter clump, but then my cats dont get a clean box. The short clump time basically means damp clumps get tossed in the drawer.

I cleaned their old box 2x a day. I did not like it and do not want to do it again, but it was a large open box that seemed like it gave them a better potty experience, there was no smell since the clumps were covered and had time to harden. And im almost ready to go back to this because the idea of the old dry poopbox sounds better than the wet poopbox of the LR4.

My plan is to give it another deep clean (even though I did one a week ago) and replace the bag maybe every 1 to 2 days..(even though that's not what the litter robot was supposed to be about) and see if this helps with the smell part of the problem. I'm not sure how to truly determine whether my cats are comfortable in it or not.  

Comment whatever your thoughts are."
"I don't understand the praise for Litter Robots Customer Service and/or ProductI had an LR4 for less than a week before it had over-torque errors, which seemed to get worse and worse everyday.

I sent in a request for return and didn't hear back for over a week with a return shipping label. 

That return shipping label cost me $65 to return their defective product.

Seeing the number of complaints about the LR4 on this subreddit, combined with everyone's recommendation for the 3 year warranty...I am questioning why I even thought I should give this product a try. 

My experience doesn't appear to be an outlier and while I understand a complicated device such as this one can have issues, for nearly a grand I would expect this product to be refined and production ready...but it seems nearly every other thread is users posting issues. 

&#x200B;

I guess my biggest problem is the fact I had to pay for a return shipping label when their product was DOA the first week. They took over a week to send me a return label and now are telling me it's going to take 4 weeks to process my refund...

______________
**Update:**


My thread is being down-voted because I posted my issues with the company and product. This entire subreddit is shilled to the max, doesn't help the mods are probably Whisker PR. 

TLDR: I'm dreaming of my $1.1k refund so I can go purchase a new litter box every other week for the next three years (which happens to be the life expectancy for an LR). Thanks for listening."
"Litter Robot 3 doesn't spin smoothly, and overshoots the empty positionHello. We've had the LR3 for a couple years now and we've always had issues here and there, but for the past few weeks it's just been nonfunctional. The globe will spin to the emptying position, stop, then just keep spinning in the same direction instead of reversing, and eventually it'll fault (and sometimes it faults before then, too). We've noticed that the rotation of the globe is kinda bumpy or wavy, but it seems to be set well in the grooves so we're not sure what could be causing that but we're worried that's affecting the sensors. Inner shield and black key are not installed and have not been for years. All sensors checked and seem to be making good contact (as far as we can tell). Anybody else have this issue? Any advice would help."
Litter Robot 4 OnboardingI feel like y‚Äôall probably get this often but I just received my LR4 today and onboarding is just not happening. I‚Äôve done everything right but it just won‚Äôt connect to the wifi like all videos i‚Äôve looked up have shown. My current try is now over an hour strong and tbh I feel like returning it and getting my money back ! Any tips help. I‚Äôve tried all the other recommendations so something new (if possible) would be nice.
help finding an old postI know this might be a hard one but a long time ago someone posted a cuatomized litter robot where they opened it up so it dumped directly into a trashcan. I want to do that but cant find the post. If anyone knows it please let me know! I think it was a litter robot 3. Thanks!
"AC and unbearable stink  

I got my Litter Robot 3 back in November and I've never had an issue with it smelling until now. On the days when the AC is running, the smell makes my eyes water. Earlier in the Spring, our temperatures fluctuated from 82 one day to 50 the next so my system was switching back and forth from AC to heat. Sometimes in the same day. I don't notice a smell at all when the heat is going but when the AC comes on, it's truly horrific. 

I've checked to make sure the smell wasn't coming from the vents and it isn't. No other room stinks except my home office where the litter robot is.

I have deep cleaned it, emptied the drawer more frequently, added baking soda, and tried Rocco & Roxie Litter Box Odor Eliminator and nothing helps.

I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs urine or feces because it‚Äôs just an overall weird smell. When I deep cleaned it, I found no evidence of urine seeping into the base and after I cleaned it, I sniffed inside and out and all around it and there was no odor at all so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs seeped into the plastic or rubber. 

Maybe I need to try a different litter even though this one seems perfectly fine until the afternoon when the AC starts kicking in. I currently use Fresh Step Simply Unscented clumping clay litter."
"Cat associates the LR4 with‚Ä¶ Pain?Hi friends, 

We purchased the LR4 about 1.5 months ago and all 3 of our cats were having 0 issues using it. About 3 weeks ago, We noticed our most anxious cat pooping outside of the litter box on various rugs in the house. However, He wasn‚Äôt peeing. There‚Äôs really nowhere he could pee without us finding it / smelling it‚Ä¶ so we became worried. The LR4 helped us track it too bc he hadn‚Äôt used the robot for nearly 2 days according to the app. 

We took him to the vet and he had some inflammation that they were able to treat and that we continued to treat with meds. They let us know he was likely having pain urinating. We kept him in a separate room for a few days while he was medicated and recovering‚Ä¶ and had a regular litter box in there for him so we could monitor all that without the other cats using it. He recovered and now he‚Äôs doing a okay. 

I say all that to say‚Ä¶. He will still not go anywhere near the LR4. We watch him on our blink camera that‚Äôs mounted in the litter room‚Ä¶ and he is absolutely spooked. He used it just fine for weeks, he was actually the first cat to get in it. Does our cat now associate the litter robot 4 with pain? I tried putting the cheapo litter box beside the robot so he‚Äôs comfortable being in the same area‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs using that fine. 

I tried turning it off and placing a saucer with his favorite treats inside the LR4‚Ä¶ but he will not enter it. He will stand on the step and look inside, but he won‚Äôt use it. I tried taking the regular box away last night and he peed / pooped in the floor instead of using the robot. 

Any tips? We are still within our 90 days‚Ä¶. But I hate to return it. It‚Äôs working great, I just need ALL the cats to use it again ‚òπÔ∏è"
"RefundCurious if this a fluke or a ongoing issue. I am a bit disappointed with the process as it's feeling I am out 800 bucks with nothing to show for it. I followed there process on rma. They received my return on the 2nd of last month. I called em the other day asking what going on. The lady says there system says they not received.  Tho the fed  x tracking number they give says they got it back. I put the info on box like they asked. And now I am waiting on a call back from some other department. I don't know if this normal or if they just took my money and ran

Update: did try out online support. They had no record of the prior communication which was via phone. Prollly why no call back or bad info. Idk. Live chat tho was very helpful and had a resolution in about a hour after quoting me 3 to 5 business days. Which is great. Highly recommend communication via live support. And will be trying them out down the road again"

"Notifications stopped a few weeks agoHi guys, I've had a LR3 Connect for a few years and a couple of weeks ago I stopped getting notifications. That was the old app (litter robot). I found out about the Whisker app here but have the exact same problem. So far I have:

- Checked all the notification settings are on in both apps.
- Checked that both apps have permission to send notifications (android). 
- Logged out of both apps, then rebooted my phone, then logged back in. 
- Checked that the robot is connected to WiFi. I can see recent data in the apps fine. I turned it off and on at the wall socket just in case. 

I'm at a loss! Does anyone have any suggestions?

"Best auto litter box for larger cat?I've been considering...

* PETKIT PuraMax
* Litter Robot 3 (4 is too expensive for me)
* PetSafe ScoopFree Complete Plus

My primary needs are..

* Decent space for my larger cat \~15 lbs (I'd really like him to be comfortable if I'm spending all this money)
* Good  odor control for my smaller apartment (I don't mind something I have to  clean weekly, but I like the auto-scooping especially when  entertaining)

Other considerations...

* The PetSafe box is a lot cheaper up front, but the others may justify their price over time with cheaper litter?
* Something that's relatively quiet would be nice
* I generally choose reliability over extra features and sensors. Smart Home connection is neat, but not necessary.

Thanks in advance!"

"Results of my litter trials and new litter fenceI have 3 cats, all female, who tend to pee at the entrance. This kept causing a pee clump to stick to the liner so I tried several litters over time. Arm and hammer slide didn‚Äôt work for me at all and my sensitive girl had some balding on her back feet. I haven‚Äôt tried hardball because it is heavily scented. 

I used Dr elseys ultra for years and years but had the sticking clump issue and just cleaned it often. It started to get worse, though, so I tried Boxiepro and it really helped. However I am going through too much of it and it‚Äôs expensive so I am now mixing dr elseys ultra and the Boxiepro, and it seems to be working. 

I bought the new litter fence despite some people getting it for free (my warranty is still active). At first I thought it helped but it got filthy fast. I contacted litter robot and they are making me pay return shipping. So don‚Äôt buy the fence if you‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôll work. Congrats to people who got it for free. I got screwed.

Using the original fence and the mixture of Boxiepro/dr elseys ultra is what seems to be my best setup moving forward so anyone else looking to get rid of sticky pee-lactites without breaking the bank may want to do the same."

"LR4 ‚Äúdetecting cat‚Äù 11 times a day, even when he‚Äôs in the other room. Thoughts?I‚Äôve had the LR3 for 3 weeks now.

"Litter robot 3 cycles halfwayI have a litter robot 3, bought about two years ago. I took it apart to clean it, put it back together.

"Is this a normal amount of waste for the drawer to be full in the LR4?This thing is driving me crazy with how often it says it's full since it stops cycling. We have 3 cats but it says it's full in less than 24 hours pretty often. At first, we thought it might be the Kitty Poo Club silica litter so we switched to the LR litter but the issue continues to persist. I zero it every time and have tried recalibrating but to no avail.
Picture here - https://imgur.com/a/C6zyybd
That is after doing 4 or 5 manual cycles while it thought it was full. Does this look right?
I feel like for a piece of tech this expensive, the app should let you set and change the capacity and adjust it when it's not actually full"
"I just opened litter robot 4, it calibrates and the yellow light flashes but the cycle does not start, it has never moved once from the home position. In addition I get a solid blue light with purple light flashing (attaching picture). Please help, thanks."
Why is my LR4 not respecting 25-minute delay? It seems to stop considering anything past the third weight detection.
"First time emptying waste bin. Did I do it wrong?The app told me me the waste bin was 80% full, so I figured I oughta empty it before it gets more full. So I just pulled out the tray, took out the bag and put in a new bag.

But the app still says it's 80% full. Am I supposed to do something else? The quick start guide says nothing about emptying the waste tray (and I haven't found a manual in the box anywhere -- is it missing or online-only or something?). Was I supposed to wait until it's actually 100% full?

What's the best practice here?

Thanks for the help!"

Can screwing the bolt tighter make the cat sensor less sensitive to heavy litter?"
Any help on how to get my weight scale to read?
Help.. just got this yesterday and my cats are eating the lip.
Does anyone know where this part goes?
BRAND NEW. Just unboxed and plugged in. Ran ‚Äúinitial‚Äù cycle then I get a White light bar with two lower lights blinking yellow. Please help
"Can‚Äôt reconnect litter robot to app since last updateEver since they pushed out the update where you can add pets my liter robot has disappeared from my app. I read that some people had the same issue but it reappeared after a while but mine won‚Äôt show back up. The issue is when I try to reconnect to it, I get an error saying the litter robot had already been connected to. Does anyone have a fix for this? We are going out of town in two weeks and we have someone coming over to check on our cats but I want to see that the litterbox is actually working while we are gone."
"One of us should actually take on this job at Whisker so we can actually get some decent customer service üëÜThought I‚Äôd throw it out there due to the majority of experiences I‚Äôm seeing with the current state of ‚Äúcustomer support.‚Äù (If you can call it that.)

"My Cat Won‚Äôt Stop Using It‚Ä¶ For All the Wrong Reasons. Please Help!So let me preface this by saying that Killian is a special boy. He‚Äôs an orange tabby (a chonk, at that) who I don‚Äôt think has ever had ‚Äúthe brain cell‚Äù. I just got my LR4, and he loves it‚Ä¶ he loves lying in it, rolling around in it, and just straight up chilling in it, but he doesn‚Äôt use it as a litter box. (And neither do my other two yet, either.) 

Litter is getting EVERYWHERE because of his constant rolling around and playing in there, and my husband is already ready to return the thing because he can‚Äôt handle it. (I‚Äôll admit, it is excessive and impossible to keep up with in terms of cleaning.)

I don‚Äôt want to scold him for being in there because I WANT him to use it, just not the way he‚Äôs currently using it. I also obviously can‚Äôt monitor him 24/7. 

Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do to get him to stop using it as a playpen and only use it as a litter box? I‚Äôm desperate. üò≠"
"Just got LR4 and my cats used them within the hour!My babies used the LR4 immediately after we set them up. ‚ù§Ô∏è I was worried they‚Äôll be making messes since we immediately removed their litter boxes but they adjusted quickly. We did use their leftover litter so that might have helped. So far, we‚Äôre very impressed with it, especially with how quiet it is during cycles. üòª"
True Width?Is the width of the LR4 truly 22‚Äù? I have a spot picked out but its only 21‚Äù wide.
"Over Torque Error- Felt Strips?I got the over torque error for the first time, always at this point in the rotation. We took off the bonnet, took out the globe and cleaned it, even took the cover off the gear. Nothing jumped out at me as an obvious blockage. 

I noticed the felt around the globe opening & waste bin opening is sticky. Not coming off, but sticky. Perhaps this is causing the catch? I pushed the adhesive down and cleaned around it with a screwdriver. I‚Äôm not getting the error anymore, but it‚Äôs still catching slightly as shown in the video. It‚Äôs a matter of time before this happens again. 

Are these felt strips necessary?"

"LR4 getting full in less than 3 DaysEDIT: I updated the firmware and wiped the sensors with a microfiber towel and the robot is now at 65% full! thanks for all the help!!!

ORIGINAL POST:

I got my LR4 back in November for my one cat. It was going fine and I would change the litter once a week. I noticed the past couple weeks I would get a notification saying the litter robot is full. I decided to change from white trash bags to clear ones to see if that would help. 

Most recently, I changed the bag Sunday evening, and today, Wednesday, I‚Äôm
getting a notification that the box is full. Is there anyway to help with this? I only have one cat."
"I just want to say thank you for all of your help!this is the most positive, helpful and encouraging sub i‚Äôve ever participated in! everyone‚Äôs participation to help one another has really restored my faith in humanity. thank you all for the help! whisker is sending me a new base free under warranty."
"Unique way to prevent my cat from high-peeing into the waste port of Litter Robot 4it has been a real headache for me since I found out one of my cats takes standing up posture while peeing which causes most of the pees pour through the waste port above of LR4 and finally leak out to the floor.

After find out the root cause of urine leakage, I putt a 1/4 dog pad on the inner side of bonnet against the port, and it works well for absorbing pees and greatly reduced the leakage. The shortage is every 2-3 days I need to replace the pad and such procedure is not pleasant at all.

Last night I took a further action trying to correct my cat‚Äôs behavior of high - pee by sticking a manually made triangle inside the globe close to the waste port above(see photos attached). I hope it can prevent my cat from stretching his butt up to pee, cause no room for that, meanwhile, it should not affect the falling of wastes during cycling,or obstruct the robot‚Äôs waste box fullness measurement.

After installation, I carefully observe and examine the video recordings of my cat‚Äôs toilet using behavior in the past few hours, the result is quite positive and promising. I took a photo of the inside the robot, and it clearly show all the pee was now on the litter, instead of the above pad and side walls. 

I‚Äôm much relieved now, after 3 month of anxiety since I bought the LR4. No one from LR customer service really helped me, but people here in Reddit give me a lot information and inspirations. That is why I cannot help wait for longer to share the initial success of this unique approach. Hope it can help you if you unfortunately have the same issue as mine."
"Fence that's being send out for backwards peeing cats is an absolute failI just received the ""new"" fence in the mail that is supposed to help with pee leaking down into the unit in between the seal and the outside case. It's just a piece of clear plastic taped to the original fence, but it seemed to not cover the area properly when I installed it. Tested it with water and a syringe to see what happens and it's an absolute fail, the water leaked right down inside the unit again. 

I reached out to the support and the response they gave me was that they are working on a solution and that the unit essentially wasn't designed for cats who face any other way as butt in and face out. Honestly ridiculous given that we pay a hella lot of money for this thing. You can't just assume that a cat is gonna behave in xy way and always pees in a certain position, thats not how cats work. Given how long people complain about this issue you would think they have it resolved by now, but nope. 

If anyone knows a 3rd party seller that offers a solution please let me know, I'm unfortunately not 3D printer savvy, but I would assume the original fence design with just an angled extra piece in the back that hangs over the gap would do. Heck, if you're someone who can design something like that I'm ready to throw my money at you, I just really want a solution for this problem."
"Litter Robot 4 cycle interrupted and motor errorsI have two Litter Robot 4s, one about six months old and one fresh out of the box yesterday. The one that is six months old a few weeks ago started getting over torque errors repeatedly and eventually started getting motor errors when trying to cycle. I did all the troubleshooting steps I suggested both by Litter Robot and that I found here with no success.

We just got a Litter Robot 4 delivered yesterday and last night through into this morning it started getting 4 to 6 cycle interrupted errors every time it tries to cycle. Again, all troubleshooting steps tried, I was very careful setting it up and checking all the gaskets and filter covers and what not.

I submitted a ticket for the first Litter Robot 4 three days ago and hadn't gotten a response so I called their support number. It took about 20 minutes to get through, I did not opt to have the callback option and just waited on hold, but support was incredibly helpful and willing to send out a new base for both Litter Robots. They saw the troubleshooting steps I went through and didn't ask me to go through any additional steps so the call was very fast, I'm really happy with that experience!

If you run into trouble and the checklist of troubleshooting does not resolve your issues I recommend calling their support number, have your serial number and order number ready, they seem to be very helpful! Ôøº"
"Is it time to throw in the towel? And if I do, where do I go from here?I dunno guys :( I'm on my second base. I suspect I am at the point where they will want to send me another base, if I reach out to CS. The thing gets the red bar of death constantly for no reason, even just sitting there with nothing going on! And it's a huge struggle to get the machine to even complete a single cycle due to said red bar. I've done all the troubleshooting steps on the website. The drawer full sensor is ALSO fucked. It went from 0% full to 100% full after ONE cycle üòÇ I do not keep this thing plugged in, I plug it in only when I'm able to literally supervise the cycle start to finish.

I just keep wondering...sometimes people on this sub speculate that a lot of problems are due to user error, so it's like, maybe if I vacuum the sensors, use a microfiber cloth on the sensors, use a q-tip on the sensors... But none of that's helping. I was using white garbage bags and then realized they needed to be clear, switched to clear, and the drawer full sensor is still completely broken, so...

Chewy has a one year return policy, that's why I bought through them. I had a sneaking suspicion 90 days wasn't enough time to know for sure.

It's just, why is it acceptable for this product to work SO poorly just because it's a litter box? Can you even imagine if you paid almost 800 for a smart phone and it was BARELY functional and needed frequent replacements? It's preposterous to even consider! 

But is there really any competitor product that's any better? Or even go back to the LR3 instead of the 4? Or are all automated litter boxes pretty much flawed at the moment and I just need to wait for the technology to improve? What would you do if you were me?

When it works, it's perfect, I'm SO happy for my cat she gets a fresh bed of litter every time. But it just doesn't work and I don't have it in me to do the constant troubleshooting and constant babysitting. Scooping IS easier than all that."
My brand new litter robot 4 keeps saying it‚Äôs full when it‚Äôs not. Is it defective?
"Help its been like this for as far as Ive received it. Firmware update, app updated, tried wiping sensors. On hard ground not touching walls, trash cleaned regularly. WTF"
"Is 24 hour sleep mode possible?My cats are still getting to know our LR -- three cats, we've had it two weeks, and today for the first time one of them used it. It's been off all that time, except when I did a manual cycle. No one seems terrified of it, which is great, because two of them are very skittish.

I'd like to be able to leave it on, so that I can tell if cats are checking it out even if they don't use it, and so I know sooner if they do use it (or at least may have used it), but I definitely don't want to accidentally spook any of them before they're all using it regularly. 

I see that in the app I can set Sleep Mode to run from 12am to 12am both weekdays and weekends, now, but has anyone actually ***done*** this? I'm worried it might end up reading that time as no time rather than 24 hours, or that it might run itself once at 12am every night with that setup. Usually, I'd just test something like that by doing it, but like I said... I'm pretty worried about spooking one or more of them out of trying and trusting it."
"Flashing Blue Light on LR3I recently cleaned out my LR3 because it was registering as always full. Then it was working fine for a day before getting stuck upside down. 

Since then, it‚Äôs stuck in flashing blue light and nothing I try helps. I‚Äôve followed all instructions and guides on this to no avail. 

Unfortunately, Whisker product support ranks among the worst I‚Äôve ever encountered and I‚Äôm getting no support from them. 

Any thoughts on what to do?"
Feature Request: Notify when cycle doesn't completeIt would be really helpful to have an option to get reminders if the robot is stuck or a cycle didn't complete.  We have some times where it's stuck during a cycle and getting an urgent reminder to fix it would make things less stressful or worrying that we need to have a backup.
"Help!LR 3 has been working the last year and now just blinks orange. When I reset it it goes blue for a minute like it‚Äôs ready. But then goes right back to orange blinking.

"Over cycling wrong direction and flashing yellow light litter robot 3In the beginning, like 5 months ago, the litter showed me an error with the flashing yellow light, I realized it was a problem with the pinch, I've cleaned the metal ends and placed them together and everything worked fine until now. My problem now is that after I turn on the litter robot it starts doing the cycle like it should, reaching until the cycle finished separating the sand, stops like it should, and then it has to go back to its normal position, but instead after it stops it just goes over the normal cycle, over turning, shifting, going to the wrong direction and stops, flashing yellow light. I tried everything, cleaned the litter, make sure everything is in place, I can assure you that the touching metal parts, the contact metal parts from the pinch are very well placed together.   Another thing is that after I turn off the litter, unplug it, placed back the globe as it should stay and start it again sometimes it works even for 5 rounds of cycling and then I get the same error with the pinch flashing. I couldn't find anyone else with the same problem with the over cycling in the wrong direction. Please help me, thanks!

"Positive customer serviceI just wanted to post my experience this morning with LR customer service.  I called in because I purchased a slightly used LR4 and couldn't register it to my account due to it being active on the previous owner's account.  

I was on hold, for an hour and half, which I had expected when I called in.  The automated message offered to hold my place in line and call me back, but I chose to wait on hold. 

The rep I spoke with was polite and very helpful.  I provided the information on the previous owner, the serial number, and she took care of moving it from the old owner's account to mine. 

I had also mentioned that my previous LR4 I had gotten in December the liner was looking a bit ragged on.  She immediately put in an order for a replacement globe with a heavy duty liner, no questions asked!  

The overall phone call was quick.  The rep was responsive and took care of everything quickly and easily.  I was told to expect the replacement globe to ship within 3-5 business days, and received an email confirming the ""order"".  

I have had no problems at all with my LR4, and the new one had been running perfectly even without being attached to my account.  I'm 1000% satisfied with my purchase and sing the praises of this litter box to everyone I know who owns a cat.  

Thanks Whisker for making an exceptional product, wonderful customer service, and a customer for life."
"New fence keeps clumps on itI have a cat that likes to pee and poop right near the new large fence, sometimes even on it. I notice that with the new taller fence, the poop or pee clumps stay on it. Anyone have a workaround to help it glide off so it doesn‚Äôt stick on there?"
"HELP- DRYING THIS THING!How long do you dry yours? I found mine stunk, and realized there's a fuzzy strip like there is on the base under the litter trap inside the globe. So when i think it's dry, that strip is still wet and gets litter stuck to it, and probably waste particles and gets moldy. How the hell am I supposed to dry that? It's like between the globe and the litter gate/filter/trap, in the inside of the entrance. You can't see or get to it very well. 

I'm willing to bet that most people don't even realize this part is there. It would take maybe a day or longer to dry this piece fully. It's definitely the cause of the stink. I tried to get to it and clean it, but i started to bend the litter trap getting under there, and I definitely don't want to break this expensive thing. HELP!"
"LR4 rotating extremely slowly and not completing the cycle. Three red lights, two flashing yellow lightsMy mom and I have been sitting here for about an hour trying to fix our LR4, and we just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

A few days ago, it started turning very very slowly, but fixed itself once we got all the bigger litter clumps out. Now it‚Äôs doing it again and we can‚Äôt seem to fix it.

"No Response from CS??? Help!!‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢solved‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Heya,

I've had some sort of critical failure with my LR 3 and have tried every trick in the book. Followed every LR approved tutorial, followed every YouTube tutorial, tried every crackpot idea you can find scouring the internet for answers and the damn thing just won't cycle. All signs point to defective and needs a new base. 

I got to the bit of the support page on Whisker's site where I can contact someone, but they just ended up emailing me the same tutorials I'd already tried to follow? With a header saying action required for contact, and a big button at the bottom asking if the problem had been solved. I pressed no, and never got an email back. Pressed no again the next day, no response... Done this a dozen times now and never got a response, so my $500 robot is sitting out of commission less than 3 months after I got it, waiting out its warrenty. 

Am I crazy? Did I miss something? Is it really just this hard to get into contact with them? Are they sleezy enough that they are seriously waiting out my warrenty? 

For anyone wondering, it is a rapid yellow flashing light and when I press it, it starts a slow blinking blue light, and when I press that one it just goes back to rapidly flashing yellow... and loops like that forever. I have legitimately cried trying to fix this thing. I have chronic back pain and I bought this thing because I physically cannot scoop my cat box often enough anymore and my cat has started peeing in the living room in protest and I am losing my actual mind. I only got this thing because it was a gift from my mom & she can't afford to buy a new one outright & neither can I. 

Please help üò≠"
"Success! My cats are both using it, here‚Äôs what helped.So happy my cats are using their LR4 and so far, so good. I figured I‚Äôd share what seemed to help. I have two cats, both are 10 y/o. One is a very confident male and the other is a skittish female. Both are not too picky about their litter box or type of litter, but can be a bit intimidated by electronics that move and make sound. This is their very first experience with any sort of electronic/self cleaning cat box. 

Day 1 - I did not set up LR4 in the same place as their normal litter box, because I just wanted them to get used to LR4 being in the home first. This is a bit different from LR‚Äôs advice, however it worked very well for me. I wanted them to still have their old litter box available for use, in its normal spot. This way it wouldn‚Äôt be too overwhelming for them. I hadn‚Äôt added litter into LR yet or turned LR on. Both cats just treated LR like it was a new piece of furniture. They liked the shipping box it came in more then the actual LR. 

Day 2 - Added litter and turned the LR on. Both cats seemed startled by LR rotating and making noise. This is the point at which they started having trust issues with LR. They would keep somewhat of a distance from LR and keep turning their heads to watch what LR was up to. 

Day 3 - started giving treats around LR. Even placed treats on the step and scatter shield. Was generous with petting when they took the treats from LR‚Äôs area. I had to be patient at this point and sit with them in front of LR for awhile. Would give pets throughout the rest of the day when they went close to LR. By the end of the day, I had removed some waste from their old litter box, and placed it into LR. I wanted them to go by smell to know it was a litter box. 

Day 4 - Success! My first cat (non-skittish one) used the LR successfully.  Saw him go to it multiple times in the first day. 

Day 5 - Success again. Second cat (skittish one) now using LR. 

So not too bad. Took 5 days for both cats. A little patience goes a long way. I also recommend keeping it on the 15 or 30 min. cycle, at least until your cats adjust. My next step is to get rid of the old box and place LR there instead. Im not too worried about this step since they are already comfortable with LR."
"When to take away old litter box?Update: I moved the old box far enough away from litter robot that he felt safe to use it without seeing the robot, but still left it unscooped, added the litter attractant herb stuff to the litter robot, and also used cardboard to kind of hide the robot a little. Lastly, I got super special yummy treats and used them to get him to come closer and closer to the litter robot on his own terms. After about 3-4 days of all that I had my first visual confirmation that he used the robot, and now based on how fast it is filling up I‚Äôm certain he is using it pretty frequently. Thank you all for the amazing advice!!!!        

Original post:       
We have two cats, and one is specifically scared of the litter robot. We had two normal litter boxes, and replaced one with the litter robot and kept the other one but have not been scooping it.   
One cat seems to be okay with the robot, but the other is having a tougher time adjusting, for the first week he was scared to go into the room with it, and when he heard it cleaning he would crouch down low and investigate it from far away.  
For the first 1.5 weeks I‚Äôve been keeping it off and manually running it twice a day so that they get used to the sound but it isn‚Äôt going off frequently.  
I know the scared cat is using the old box still, but am unsure if he is using the robot at all yet (tray is filling up so I know at least one of them is using it, scared cat might be using both?). 
So my question is- should I remove the old litter box so that the scared one is forced to use the robot? He is definitely warming up to it, he now is fine being in the same room and doesn‚Äôt flinch when he hears it running. I really don‚Äôt want to have him using the old stinky one anymore.  

TLDR: will removing old litter box help cat use litter robot even if they are currently cautious of it?"
"Why no option to cycle based on a schedule rather than a timer?Whisker should really consider adding the option of adding the option of adding a schedule in addition to their delay options. Like their feeder. This way the user can cycle it at N hours; whether it be 1, 2, 3, etc. times per 24 hours.

This can give the user flexibility and peace of mind. And reduce the amount of incidents that occur regarding errors, etc."
"LR3 night light + bonnet error glitchJust discovered this glitch and wanted to share in case it helps someone else. 

I have two LR3‚Äôs for my two cats. I got the first one 6 years ago for my first cat and the other one three years ago when I adopted again. It‚Äôs nice to have two for redundancy in case one gets stuck. 

Lately, the 6 year old LR3 had been having CONSTANT ‚Äúbonnet removed‚Äù errors. I was watching a cycle run and it was doing fine until I turned off the light and was about to walk away. The cycle just stopped. I flipped the light back on and hit ‚Äúcycle‚Äù and it finished no problem. 

After some testing, I found out that the night light turning on is what is causing the bonnet issues. My boxes live in a semi-dark bathroom so their night lights are on a lot of the time. I‚Äôve now put a little lamp in there and turned off both of their nightlights and everything has been running perfectly for 3 days! 

Hope this helps someone else who may be having the same problem."

"When to remove old box if one cat still hasn‚Äôt taken to LR4?I have two cats. The first one took to the LR no problem and has been using it ever since. Game changer. Second one not so much.

It‚Äôs been 3 weeks now and the other cat is not a fan. I‚Äôve left the old box next to the LR and let it get dirty to encourage use of the new box. 

First week, she poked head in but didn‚Äôt touch it.

Second week, used twice, both times at 4:45am.

Third week, hasn‚Äôt used it.
 
Since she‚Äôs used it before I know she can do it‚Ä¶ she just clearly doesn‚Äôt care for it üò© she‚Äôs an older and timid cat, so I‚Äôm also worried that getting *into* the LR might also be a deterrent.

I‚Äôm tempted to pull the old box so she doesn‚Äôt have an option, but I don‚Äôt want her to go somewhere else in the house.

Help! Any advice?"
My cat tears up the globe liner on his litter robot 3. Any insight or tips would be helpful
"LR3 won't stop cyclingIt starts the power on cycle and rotates counter-clockwise as normal. When it reaches the point where it would normally stop and reverse, it instead just keeps going and going (doesn't even stop first like it normally would). It made it about 2 full circles before I intervened and pressed the reset button, which caused it to stop and instead get permanently stuck with a solid yellow cycling light. At this point it does not respond to any buttons or the app, not even the power button. During this time the app just says that cycling is in progress, no error. Unplugging and plugging it back in does not change anything, it remains on solid yellow, although the app changes to say that it's ""ready"".

This has been happening for several weeks. If I leave it unplugged for around 2-3 days, it will ""power on cycle"" as normal after plugging it in again. Every time it will either ""infinite cycle"" as above, or it will trigger the pinch detect fault shortly after passing the point at which it is supposed to reverse. Either way results in the ""permanent solid yellow"" again for 2-3 days."
"cat wont use lr3so ive had a lr3 previously with 2 cats that were my mothers, but recently moved out and i adopted a cat. i scored an lr3 connect and set it up like i previously did, my cat refuses to go there she will poo there occasionally but would rather pee outside. once i brought her old litter box she goes to pee and poo there like normal. but will not touch the litter robot no matter what. have them both currently next to each other with litter and disconnected."
"LR3 ready light only stays on when room is litI'm new to this group, and are hoping someone else who has had the same problem can help.  We'd been having intermittent problems with the yellow light slow flashing, and have cleaned the bonnet contacts and bent the plastic tabs slightly to be sure the bonnet clicked into place.  We also realized that there was too much litter in the globe, and have taken care of that. But now we are finding that the LR only comes ready when the room light is on. The yellow flashing returns when the room light is turned off, and the blue light returns when the room light is turned on. It's a repeatable symptom, so does anyone know the likely cause?"
Litter bin says it's 75% fullBut I changed it today. It has been showing full faster and faster and I'm not sure how to fix it. What sensors need to be cleaned to try to help with this?
"Bonnet removed notificationI keep getting the bonnet removed notification on one of our LR3. I have read through previous posts here and tried to bend the metal on the sides of the bonnet, tried putting aluminum foil, tried turning off the night light, and nothing is working.  I also switched the bonnet from one of our other LR3s, but that didn‚Äôt help. I think I read something about disconnecting certain wires but I don‚Äôt want to completely break our LR.

We bought this off fb marketplace about 6 months ago and it‚Äôs been fine up til now. I can‚Äôt order a new bonnet because the warranty is under the original owner‚Äôs name, right?

Any suggestions?! I‚Äôm going crazy bc my cats keep shitting in it and have no way to get it to cycle. Thank you!!"
Where to add odor pods?I ordered a bundle that included the odor pods but there is nothing in the user manual that says where to place them in the Litter Robot 4. Help?
"LR4s Won't CycleI have had LR4s since September 2022.  Due to multiple replacements, the oldest base currently was received in December 2022.  I used to have frequent sensor faults, but now the units often fail to cycle and spend hours in timing mode. I will come home to find the globes full of waste and the history shows that no cats have been detected and a cycle hasn't run for 9 or 10 hours. (Obviously the units have been used several times.) Sensors and exteriors are cleaned daily and sleep mode is disabled.  Also, the lighting is disabled but comes on randomly.  Everything is on smart plugs and can be reset remotely, but I really shouldn't have to spend the workday monitoring litterboxes.... Anyone else having these issues?"
"Struggling to acclimateI‚Äôve had the LR4 for ~2 weeks now. The cats have used it once to urinate in the very beginning and have not touched it sense. I‚Äôve kept the old litter boxes (though not cleaned them) out of fear that if I remove them that they‚Äôll start toileting on the floor. 

Here‚Äôs a rough timeline: 
- day 1: set up LR4 in new area of the apt with fresh litter. 
- day 2-6: waste tray had one clump of urine 
- day 7: added litter from the old boxes (without excrement) to the LR4 
- day 8-14: will get notifications that the sensor is going off, though on video (we have a security cam) they put half their body in, sniff around, step out, and then sit and watch till it completes a cycle. 
- day 17 (today): added much more old litter and moved the LR4 to where the original boxes were. Moved the original boxes to where the LR4 was. Sprinkled some catnip around the general LR4 area. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm really wanting this to work. I‚Äôm thinking my next shot would be changing the timer from every 7min to every 15min to reduce the cycles and hopefully they associate the LR4 less as a toy and more like a litter box. 

Any other suggestions or tips?"
"Poop Sticking to DrumPlease help. We are at our wit‚Äôs end. We adopted an 8 month old Bengal, our second,  and his poop is all constantly all over the drum. He poops in the litter, but during the clean cycle it streaks everywhere. I think the problem is he is a big cat (12 pounds) and eats like a tank while he is still growing. We are having to scrub down the side of the box several times a day to stop the smell. Our whole office reeks. 

We‚Äôve tried changing the delay time to 30 minutes to allow more clumping time, and we‚Äôre using Arm and Hammer Clump & Seal which seems well-liked in this sub. Honestly, when we only had one cat using it the box still had a musty odor. We can empty out the tray and within a couple uses, the room smells like stale cat pee. 

We are using the LR4, bought in October and I feel like we wasted our money. Between the smell and poop-covered drum, we‚Äôre doing more work than before. Help. üò≠ I read all the threads with similar questions and none of the suggestions for odor or streaking have helped."
"Ordering a second LR3Does anyone have an average time you had to wait to get your LR?  I'm ordering a 2nd LR3 and trying to figure out how long it's going to take to get to me from order date.  Are they sending tracking info on it?  I know they usually come FedEx.  Reason is, I want one sent to my other home and I won't be there past 2 weeks.  Debating on where to get it shipped so it's not sitting on a porch of a house 6 hours away from where I am...lol.  

Thanks for any help!"
"Litter box 3 connect anytime on how to hide?I was gifted the litter robot 3 connect for my 3 cats. Its wonderful and does help out a lot. I do get some issues from time to time but usually a deep clean by taking apart helps. My only problem is I have no where to really put it with out it being out in the open and litter just being spread around like wild fire, even if having a mat in front of it. Been looking into hiding it with a cabinet so it would be easier to contain the litter in one space to keep it from tracking everywhere. The whisker app has one but 500 for particle board I can't see myself getting. Has anyone built ther own or diy'ed one and have any tips for making one?"
"Mold in waste basket... Switch litter?Hi everyone, I have a different automatic litter box (Petkit Pura X), but this sub is much larger so I thought I'd ask the LR community as well. Recently, I've seen white fuzzy mold grow in the waste basket (looks like cotton filling). I've been using Arm & Hammer Slide multicat purple box. Clumps well, great odor control, low tracking. I honestly loved it until mold started to grow in the waste basket of the automated box. (No issue in the regular boxes). 

Obviously the basket is an enclosed environment prone to fungi and bacteria. But has anyone found that switching litter solved it? I found old posts asking for help, but I'm not sure what if anything fixed their issue. AH has baking soda in it, so I would think it should prevent mold better than other litters, but maybe not? I'm looking into Boxiecat extra strength red and Dr Elsey. Has anyone fixed the mold problem? Is Boxiecat red better than pro for an automatic box because the clumps are supposedly harder? Which Dr Elsey works best in an automatic box as far as clumping, odor, and low tracking? Thank you!"
Cleaning the sensors and adding petroleum jellyI‚Äôve had a litter robot 4 for a week with minimal issues so far. I‚Äôve been seeing posts and comments about cleaning the sensors with alcohol and adding vaseline/petroleum jelly to them. Do you do this and if you do how often does it need to be done? Do you find it helps prevent errors? Do you put anything on top of the vaseline? I would be worried that the vaseline would make it more retentive to dust.
"Cleaning my Litter Robot 4 for the first timeHi folks, this is my first litter robot ever, and I am a bit apprehensive about dismantling it to clean it properly, and then putting it back together. I‚Äôve also had it for three months now and the sensors are starting to become faulty because I think it really needs to be cleaned. I have a tendency to break things, and with my luck, I fear I might do it with my LR4. Would you please share your Tips/tricks and/or any url or YouTube videos that you personally use to help you? Thanks so much in advance."
"Air filter?Question.

Anyone have a recommendation for small wall plug sized air purifiers?

"#$&@ Bonnet Removed ErrorFor the love of God, can we PLEASE get the ability to override the ""Bonnet Removed"" error?!? No, the bonnet is not removed. I have eyes on it right now. It's definitely on there. Yes, I've tried bending the tabs, which helps for one day."
"Littler Robot Issue FIXMy litter Robot started having issues right out of the box. It would start a cleaning cycle but would stop because it thought a cat was inside it. It would stay paused and show a red light for hours and none of the buttons worked to reset the machine. Well, I did a little searching and located the sensors that detect whether a cat has entered the POD. They are located at the top of the dome. After a minute I located the problem. There was a single cat hair right across one of the sensors. Once removed, the litter robot started working like normal! Hope this can help other people! Sometimes the biggest problems, have the simplest solutions. 

Now I gotta figure out how to prevent hair from attaching to the sensor. Hope the company can fix this issue."
"Don‚Äôt bother. 2 year old LR3- I spend more time reseting it than I would scooping a litter box. And I have the last one that they made that isn‚Äôt crap.My LR3 does not even fully cycle anymore about half the time. I spend more time manually cycling, watching to make sure it worked, doing it again when it doesn‚Äôt over and over that it would actually be easier and less frustrating to just scoop. Unfortunately, I needed something like this because I travel so often. I‚Äôve tried all of the online suggestions.

Adding more detail on what I‚Äôm seeing from a response that I provided below: 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Hi- so I don‚Äôt actually know whether the red light activates when my monsters get out.

I get ‚Äúbonnet is removed‚Äù and over torque fault errors all of the time. It isn‚Äôt the cats being in it or around it- they will be sitting next to me and I get the errors on my phone.

When I go to check it, it will rotate only half way, then rotate back to the starting point again like it is done when it hasn‚Äôt done anything.

I have to hit the cycle button, which just puts it in the same position of only half rotating again. I have tried doing the reset thing and pressing down on the front of the bonnet to activate the red light which doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything either. Then, I end up turning it off then on again. Sometimes that works, but not usually. Ultimately, I have to unplug it and plug it in again. That always works.

I clean it about once every two weeks when I replace the litter and clean out the globe with water, vinegar and a bit of cleaning solution.

The next time I catch one of the monsters going, I‚Äôll see if the red light turns on. What does that indicate?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Another edit- I have flashing red and blue. I‚Äôm going to take it apart and clean everything and see if that helps. Thanks for your responses!"
Random screw?Hey all! My LR4 was just delivered today (so excited!!). When I opened up the little dust bag with the LR4 inside there was a lonely small screw sitting there. Anyone have any idea where it could go? Thanks in advance!
Alexa skill? It seems to me that it would be helpful if there was an Alexa skill that declares for all to hear that litter needs added or the drawer is full so one person isn't responsible for keeping track of it in the app. I didn't see anything in the Alexa app...
"My LR4 has never completed a cycleI've become very frustrated and am hoping anyone can help me trouble shoot my litter robot issues. 

I ordered the LR4 off amazon in mid November 2022 and when it arrived I had set it up and once powered on I attempted to connect to the app but it automatically attempted to cycle and stopped maybe 1/5 way through and the lights were solid red. 

I reached out to whisker and they redirected to amazon for help since I did not order directly from them which was just another frustrating step. 

I am in contact with who I ordered from on amazon but responses are not matched as I have noticed they get back to me at 3 am so there must be a significant time difference? 

anyways I'm at a loss of what to do. I have no way of seeing the firmware I have since I can't connect to the app, and I felt extra stupid when my boyfriend found out I spent nearly 1000$ CAD on a self cleaning box but am still scooping poop every day... 

please if anyone has any suggestions? I have tried cleaning the sensors and adjusting the litter amounts (I do use pretty litter which I have read could be triggering the sensor because it is dusty) but nothing has worked out."

"Yellow light fast flash won't stopSo I know this has been posted about before, but we've tried all of the tricks we've seen here along with the manufacturer recommended troubleshooting. 

Just a few hours ago, the yellow light started flashing as if the pinch detector was set off for some reason. It's admittedly been a while since we've cleaned the whole thing, so we figured now is the time. Disassembled it, cleaned the pinch detector, reassembled. Yellow light is still at it. Tried to open/close the detector with the little plastic tab it's resting behind. No dice. Cleaned the entire thing, but nothing doing. We even tried the foil trick in this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/qxojfw/yellow_light_rapidly_blinking_after_cleaning_globe/

Nothing is working. It's still flashing just as it was, 4x/sec. Anyone have any suggested fixes? This thing should be in an easier-to reach place. I'm really getting tired of disassembling and reassembling the whole contraption over and over. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
"Litter robot stuck in mid cycle.Mine has been sticking as soon as it shows the opening and nothing I do fixes it. I have contacted support but it has now been 3 days since I last emailed, which included this video. This is my second robot, the first was replaced because it became bricked, wouldn't do anything at all. Then the last email I received made a strong implication that I was the one doing something wrong. The video doesn't show litter in it, because it is much easier to clean a tote then the litter robot, and no reason to keep using it when it can't even cycle. This has been going on for over a month and the last ""troubleshooting"" the person had me do was check that the firmware was up to date, and after showing it was, it was implied I'm the cause of the issue. 

Not a happy customer. Received my first one in September and have had a paperweight longer then I have had a working litter box. Getting to the point that I am about ready to demand my money back and will find something else for my cats.

"Help with securing the fence on the LR4My boy cat loves to sit in the LR, and scratch at the fence for extended periods of time, from the outside in.  Twice now, he's managed to dislodge the fence so that it goes into the LR, to be deposited in the bin, both fouling the fence, as well as making the LR believe that the bin is full.  Any tips on making sure the fence is better secured so that it's harder for him to dislodge?    


Leaving it off is not an option, as both he and his sister are really good at making sure there's an equal amount of litter outside the bot as in, when there's no fence in place."

"Teaching a pet sitter about LR4?We are approaching our first long trip since getting our Litter Robot 4 and I'm curious if y'all have any tips for helping your pet sitter keep your LR4 happy while you're away. I'm already planning on a few things:

1. Leave a printed QR code that brings up a basic tutorial on YouTube.
2. Put a sticky note or painters tape or something on the LR4 with labels for the buttons.
3. Give instructions to empty the drawer (even if it isn't full) and wipe/vacuum the sensors every visit (we have 5 cats, two of whom are kickers, so our sensors can be temperamental if not cleaned often).
4. Put out one manual box as a safety net.
5. Provide extra manual boxes and extra litter so the sitter can add more boxes if Turd Burglar decides he hates me and has issues the sitter can't fix.

Anything y'all think I'm missing? Any other tips for making it as easy as possible for someone else to keep a LR4 running smoothly? I've heard enough stories about LR4 waiting until you leave to have issues that I want to be as prepared as possible.

Also, if anyone has ideas on how to remotely restart the LR4 with a backup battery installed, I'd love to hear 'em. I know the smart plug for remote reboots is a popular tip, but our area is prone to power outages so I don't think I can take it out while we're away and the battery keeps the smart plug trick from working. I may be SOL there, but I figured it was worth an ask."

"Introducing LR4 to three catsI've had my two LR4s set up in different rooms almost a week.  They have the same litter used in their old boxes with a cup of the old litter. I also have two standard litter boxes (one in each room with the robots). I've continued to scoop the old boxes, but not every day, so they are much dirtier than normal. Both LR4s are turned off and I only cycle them when everyone is out of the room (right after they're used). 

I have two one year old cats and one 18 year old. One of the younger cats jumped in right away and used it. He's been choosing the robots over the old litter box regularly - yay! His sister is more timid. She took several days to jump in and hasn't used it yet. She gets in multiple times a day and even scratches the litter, but still not using it. Do you think that's a good sign that she's at least getting in? 

As far as my old man, I don't have much hope that he'll ever use one of them. I bought the ramp for one of the robots to help encourage him. I tried putting him in the LR this morning and he immediately left. I gave him treats on exit. 

My husband thinks we should remove the old box from the room he is in most of the time, making him go to the other room (small condo) or choose the LR in ""his"" room. I'm worried about causing litter box issues by moving the old box. Thoughts/suggestions?"
"Help getting cat to stop urinating on the stairs?So for the past few months our female cat has been urinating on the stairs and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do about it. We have two other cats that are bigger than her that use the box just fine and we keep the interior pretty clean but she will just stick her head in and urinate on the stairs. This in turn causes all the cats to drag the urine all over the house while we‚Äôre at work because they have to step through it to get to the box. 

I would just set out a litterbox but in the past she would just urinate over the edge of the box or onto the wall of the box if we had a taller one. I‚Äôm at my wits end with this girl and I really don‚Äôt want to make her live outside but the smell  is getting ridiculous.

Flashing blue and white lights?My litter robot 4 is stuck and is flashing blue and white lights!  Can someone please help?
"Flap InsideSooo we have the LR4, and that flap does not stay down. Whenever it cycles, all the poop just goes right under the flap and into the litter holding tank. When it cycles back to refill the litter inside, the poop comes with it. Obviously because of this it isn't going into the tray below, and we have to scoop manually. Kinda frustrated by both the LR3 and LR4. How do we fix this?"
"Weight issues after latest firmware updateFirst off, thanks Whisker for the last firmware update. We live in a climate where avoiding bugs in the house is just an impossible task and so far this update has corrected the frequent gnat-triggered cycles which were preventing me from finally taking away the last manual box. If things hold, I can stop scooping for real soon! That said, it has also caused a minor issue for me. Since I updated, my LR4 has been under-weighing one of my cats. It's kind of her fault, but it wasn't an issue before and I suspect it can be easily fixed. Here's what goes down, to clarify:

1. Noodle puts her paws on the step, sticks her face in the globe, and deeply ponders whether or not she needs to poop.
2. LR4 detects her and waits to make sure she sticks around for 10 sec.
3. She sticks around long enough, but still doesn't enter the globe.
4. LR4 confirms the cat detect and weighs her at the same time resulting in my 12.5lb cat being weighed at 5.8lbs because most of her weight is still on her back feet on the floor.
5. Noodle ultimately gets in and does her business after the weight is recorded. Her full weight is never noted.

In the activity log, it also now shows the weight recorded **before** the cat detect when it used to happen after so I expect that something about the new cat detect logic is negatively impacting the weight recording logic. My suggestion would be to keep monitoring the weight throughout the time a cat is detected. If it changes before the cat detect clears and the timer countdown starts, LR4 should update with the new weight. I'm sure Noodle will still cause some inaccurate weighs because she ponders for 10+ sec and decides the time simply isn't right,  but this would help keep them to a minimum."

He used the bot just fine for several months, then he started just walking straight in, without fully going in and turning around or digging for a spot, and poos right at the entrance (it always falls out, he misses). And recently, he‚Äôs started just straight up pooping anywhere else in the room on the floor. Not even bothering to get in the bot anymore. Any ideas on how to help encourage him getting his butt back in the bot?"

"PROBLEM SOLVED! *high pee-er, vertical pee-er, elevator butts! *To those with Litter robot 4, and with cats who pee high (OUT THE PORT HOLE) resulting in weekly deep cleans of the whole robot because urine leaked throughout the bonnet, outside of the globe, into the base, out on your floors...I've finally come to a solution! Mind you, I've been trying to figure out a 'fix' since October. After trying everything I've found through these posts, and my own prototypes of solutions from hanging strings, using silicone mats with openings for the clumps to fall thru, making 'vents', silicone caulk, hot glue, tape, pee pads...etc, I think I've got IT!! With just heavy duty double sided tape and small sized pee pads!  I need to figure out how to post pictures...but pretty much take a small pee pad (needs to fit on the inside of the bonnet) and use double sided heavy duty tape to stick it to the bonnet, so that when you close the bonnet it will cover the port hole. Make sure you don't stretch out the pee pad too tight/flush against the bonnet, you want it a little loose so it can hang a little and cover the port hole, 4 pieces of tape on each corner is good enough. But yeah! It works!! Just take out/ replace the pee pad and tape when the pee is too heavy for the pad. üòÄüòÄüòÄ I hope this helps and takes away all your frustration regarding the issue!!"
"Litter-Robot AND traditional box?Does anyone use a Litter-Robot and a traditional litter box, covered or not?

I got a Litter-Robot because I have a bad habit of forgetting about cleaning them. This has caused one of my girls to urinate on my bed when she's unhappy with it; she hasn't done it recently, the litter boxes have been cleaned as often as I can, but I still forget sometimes.

It isn't her fault by any means, but I know it can be frustrating for the both of us and I'm trying to do better.

So far she is the only one of out of the three who hasn't used/is still scared of the Robot based off the weights that come in and how she reacts when I try to coax her into the room where the boxes are.

I've been letting the boxes build up so they'll use the Robot and so she's urinated on my bed.

I'm getting a new bed and I want to avoid this happening again, but I'm worried she won't ever use the Robot.

I saw a traditional litter box that had a shifter option and am debating getting it so she has a place to go that she isn't scared of.

So does anyone have a traditional box and Litter-Robot? Or have any tips to help my cat adjust?"
Screen seems to be busted.So the little screen isn't catching anything as everything seems to just fall through. Took a closer look and the whole thing doesn't even seem connected anymore. Was it always like that or is it failing on me? Any help would be appreciated üëçüëçüëç
My cat keeps messing with my waste drawerMy male cat keeps messing with the liner in the waste drawer. He will literally claw at it and bring the liner up causing my litter robot to stop completely. Has anyone else experience this?? I got this thing because I work 12 hrs and have adhd to the point where I forget to change litter. If anyone has advice it'd certainly be helpful I wanna try not to use sleep mode because it's in my guest bedroom and so I really only use it to shower.
"Litter dust in the power port?Help!! I unplugged and moved the litter robot to another room. In the process some litter dust got lodged into the power port. When I try to plug the cord back into it, it won‚Äôt go all the way in to power back on. I‚Äôve tried vaccuming and loosening the dust to get it out but no luck. Any suggestions??"
"Found the reason my Litter Robot 4 kept starting and stopping.I have a Litter-Robot 4, which has kept stopping multiple times during a cycle.  Litter Robot just sent me a replacement base, so I was able to compare the difference between the two.  Looking from the back towards the front with the globe out, I had an extra piece of felt which was only partially attached.  This piece of felt was partially twisted on itself, like it had been twisting during the cycle. On the new replacement base, there are just two flat pieces of felt tape which are well-adhered.  If you are having similar behavior of multiple stops during a cycle with no other solution, you may want to remove your globe and check the inside lips.  Hope that helps.

Litter 4 not reading correctlyI updated the firmware last night because it said two and all of the readings are totally off now-  told me my drawers full when it‚Äôs not even remotely full it was changed yesterday !  turned the device on and off to see if maybe that would help! It did help but  something not right with the latest release !
"[LR4 Review] Finally happy with it after 6 months!* I pre-ordered the LR4 in July 2022 and it arrived in August 2022. This is the first time I have owned a robotic litter box. Like many other users, I expected a device that worked smoothly on arrival and I was surprised by the amount of upkeep and knowledge (knowledge of sensors, knowledge of reading the status lights, and general knowledge of troubleshooting) required to be an LR4 owner.
* My first LR4 didn't work at all (it always got stuck upside-down with the solid red light like many other owners, despite endless troubleshooting and sensor cleaning), but Whisker quickly replaced it in August 2022.
* My second LR4 does stall a few times every cycle (""Cycle Interrupted"") but thankfully it eventually finishes the cycle every time.
* My only significant gripe until recently was that the waste drawer sensors were unreliable and would say full after 1-2 days despite my user the Whisker brand clear liners (I only have 1 cat and it never got anywhere near full before the machine would refuse to cycle), but this has improved after recalibrating the waste drawer sensors with the most recent firmware update. Now I can go about 6 days before I get a message that the waste drawer is full and about 7 before the LR4 refuses to cycle.
* The device sometimes goes offline randomly, maybe once per month. I bypass this by keeping my LR4 on a smart plug which allows me to power cycle the LR4 remotely (and therefore remotely trigger a cleaning cycle even if I can't access the LR4 through the Whisker app) and generally once I power cycle the LR4 it reconnects to the Whisker app.  For me, the smart plug is essential because it gives me peace of mind that I will always be able to manually cycle the LR4 even if I'm out of town for a few days.
* The LR4 is very quiet and does a great job with odors (I also have a HEPA air purifier running nearby).
* I absolutely recommend the extended warranty, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if new issues arise after the first year.
* So, finally after 6 months, I'm pleased with the LR4.  I hope this resonates with other LR4 owners and perhaps can help others decide whether or not to purchase it."

"Cats scaredWe have 2 female cats, just got the Litter robot last week. One cat has been sporadically using it, although I  still have a normal litter box available. Today the other litter box was full and she decided just to pee on the floor. She seems scared when it goes through a cycle. My other cat is terrified and won‚Äôt even step foot near the thing. We also have been leaving some treats on the rim hoping it will entice them to use the litter robot. If anyone has any suggestions please help."
"Need help with Customer ServiceHi all, we bought our litter robot a year and a half ago. We also bought the extended warranty. The litter robot has what we believe to be a failed sensor, complete with blinking lights and incomplete rotation. I emailed almost two weeks ago and haven't heard back from anyone about where to go from here. Is there a faster way to get ahold of someone?"
"Positive result with customer serviceBack when the LR4 was in preorder, I bought it. And since then it‚Äôs been riddled with issues. Most of them just kinda ‚Äòresolved themselves‚Äô. Inconsistent for sure. But over the last 6 months or more it‚Äôs been doing the ‚Äòbonnet was removed‚Äô error. Sometimes fixing itself. After random periods of time. Did all the prescribed troubleshooting before contacting customer service. 

First they sent a free bonnet. It was definitely a new design. The press tabs on the side had ribs to aid with grip. But that didn‚Äôt solve the problem. So I let them know and they sent me a brand new base for free. No inner globe but all I had to do was transfer that over and set up a new LR4 on the app. ‚ÄúMarvin 2.0‚Äù. So far zero problems. 

I‚Äôm posting this to let people know that it‚Äôs not all bad with whisker. üôÇ (I know there‚Äôs a slant where people who are upset are a great deal more likely to post online about it.)"

"I think I beansed the Pinch Detector reset... I need help. I'm tapping out.First off: **I have submitted a ticket with the official support team. Seeing as it's after work-hours, I'm hoping I might get a temporary/immediate fix while I wait for a response-- even if it is a band-aid.**

Here's the backstory:

I started getting Drawer-full notifs after *just* changing the litter last week. That lead up into the Pinch Detected at startup error. Did all the troubleshooting, factory-reset, filed the pinch pins, nothing. The unit *will not move*.

Symptoms:

* On BOOT: Yellow Flashing Light (QUICK)
* App Notice: Pinch Detected at Startup (Power Cycle & Factory Reset)
* Regular Reset: Reverts to ""Drawer Full"" when bin inserted. When NO bin inserted, stays on Pinch Detected.

What I've already done:

* Completely removed litter bin/bag. Didn't think it was the problem but worth a try.
* Complete disassembly/clean.
* Specifically targeted clean of DFI sensor covers. Did notice residue, has been removed.
* Complete *full replacement* with new Pinch Sensor metal pins. The new ones **Are Touching.**
* Factory Resets/Power Cycles/Soft Resets, you name it.

What do I do from here... what am I missing? Please.. I need help. I'm disabled and I don't even have a damn scoop anymore. I'm struggling. It's already in pieces. Name it and I'll *do it*. I don't know what else to do at this point and I've always been quick to panic when something goes wrong. Considering I've been using toilet paper to scoop a litter box since Thursday, I'd say I'm handling this okay.

# Help me.

  
EDIT 10/28/21: They never responded via chat after 4x 5h waiting periods in chat. The verdict is: **Full DFI + Pinch Detector Replacement**."
"Litter Robot 3 EnclosureAll,

My wife and I need to move the cat box due to an incoming little person who is sadly taking over our furry friends litter box room/office. We wanted to get a Litter Robot 3 to aid us in how many times we need to clean the small creatures in the house, but we have a small house and would prefer it not in the open. We are saving up and like the idea of the LitterRobot as a friend of ours like her's a lot. 

Has anyone found a litter box enclosure other the the ones sold by litter robot that fits the litter robot 3? We want one in white or black and it will likely live near the front door as a key stand type thing or in the living room corner as an ""end table"" or ""cabinet"". My wife isn't a fan of the look or cost of the ones sold by litter robot and so I wanted to reach out to the cat/reddit community for ideas!

[Example of one we liked but too small for Litter Robot 3](https://www.wayfair.com/pet/pdp/archie-oscar-huckabee-litter-box-enclosure-w001753299.html?piid=296800661) 

Any ideas are appreciated and the  ""required"" ;) cat pictures are below!  Thank you!

"The secret to a smell-free litter robotEverything I did didn‚Äôt do anything to help the smell until I replaced the rubber liner in the box. I can now be sitting directly next to the box and not smell anything. This is such a game changer and I‚Äôm wondering why this isn‚Äôt talked about more! Figured I‚Äôd share to help out others!

Edit: This is for owners with older robots. My LR is over 3 years old so this won‚Äôt apply to everyone. I had fully taken it apart and soaked it in various enzyme Natures Miracle products for days, spraying every other hour, then a full Lysol disinfectant soak for a day; unfortunately after all that work the smell still was there."
"Brand New LR4 ErrorsOur one week old LR4 is nothing but errors, and I‚Äôm on the verge of returning‚Ä¶

Our cats took to the LR4 immediately which was great.

However, essentially about 25% of the time when a cycle is triggered, it is ‚Äúinterrupted.‚Äù I have observed this behavior as the LR4 is in our living room, there is no cat nearby. It happens at random points in the cycle, so there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason there. 

How the LR4 is set up:

-	On hardwood, with nothing underneath. 
-	Large fence attached, 3rd party stairs in front, about an inch away from the LR4
-	Using Boxie Pro litter
-	Firmware up to date

What I‚Äôve tried that doesn‚Äôt work:

-	Cutting power to the LR4 via smart outlet. When it powers back on and goes through it‚Äôs colored test lights, it goes straight back to red. It will not cycle via buttons or app, completely frozen in an unusable state.
-	Factory resetting the LR4, and reinstalling the app.
-	Trying different litter levels, both just above and below the fill line.
-	Using the reset button until the status light turns white, to reset the scale.

What I‚Äôve tried that temporarily works:

-	Cleaning the sensors. If I get all the way in there and wipe the sensors, vacuum the sensors, and/or use a little alcohol on a qtip, that allows the LR4 to cycle. The problem is 1-5 cycles later, we are in the same exact boat.

Since the cleaning of the sensors temporarily fixes it, seems like that‚Äôs the issue. However when I clean the sensors, I don‚Äôt see and dust or hair on or around them. The daily errors are excessive, and I can‚Äôt rely on this thing if I need to be around to clean the sensors so often. They seem way too sensitive.

Please help! Any insight is much appreciated!"
"Cleaning cycle constantly interrupted by furI had my LR4 for a little more than 2 weeks now and my cat is using it just fine. Lately I have noticed that the LR4 will stop mid cleaning cycle with red lights, wihout anyone near it. It seems it reacts to fur from my cat being stuck either at the sensors or at the fence. Really disappointed that it's this sensitive and that I can't rely on it doing what it's supposed to do. I have been trying to wipe the sensors and fence with a microfiber-cloth, but it only works for a little while. Am I the only one with this problem?"
"What to do about my cats ripping up their LR4 rubber globe linerI've had a LR4 for about 3-4 months, and after using it one+ of them just scratches at the sides which has now created holes in the rubber where the rubber meets the plastic (3 and 9 o'clock)...no matter the box they're using they always scratch the sides from 3 and 9 o clock downwards. 

I did send pictures to Whisker and they sent me a replacement glove, which I haven't installed yet. I am trying to plan my next steps concerning:

1) Prevention 
-Trim my cats nails
-Put something on top of rubber to protect it

2) Repair 
-I tried to cover the damage with gorilla tape but it doesn't stick to the rubber

I do have the warranty and I did extend it during purchase but I don't want to have to rely on the manufacturer to keep sending me new globes for my cats to tear through.

Thank for any feedback/guidance!!!"
"Constant cat sensor faults - LR4I‚Äôm not sure what do to do about the constant cat sensor faults I‚Äôm experiencing. I feel like I can‚Äôt rely on my cats having access to the robot while I‚Äôm out. I did take some litter out and reset and it seemed to help a bit but I‚Äôm getting several to a bunch of cat sensor faults every day and I have observed that they aren‚Äôt caused by my cats. Help?!

Update: I vacuumed the sensors and haven‚Äôt had an issue for the last few days."
"Extremely Disappointed with the Recent Lack of SupportI know this has been talked about before but it‚Äôs a bit out of hand at this point. I have an LR3 and wanted to order the LR4 before I saw all the issues it was having shortly after launch. In the mean time my second LR3 which was replaced about 6 months ago started to have issues with the cat sensor. I reached out to support several times and never heard back, before posting this i messaged u/litterrobot directly via Reddit and was told my issue would be escalated, haven‚Äôt heard a thing since. 

This is beyond frustrating, there is no support via email, no access to chat, and no way to call. I understand growing pains and I think all of us here come from a place of understanding and willingness to ride out the storm because we believe in the company. However there is a fine line between being understanding and also having a fair expectation for support on a very pricey product. At this point I don‚Äôt think is too much to ask for at least a response in 24/48hrs. It‚Äôs been a week since I reached out and my issue was escalated. 

I believe this is a product that we come to rely on very much. This issue came up a week before me going on a trip and I did everything I could to find a resolution before leaving. I am now having to figure out how manage my litter situation while I am away. My plans to purchase a new LR4 are out of the picture and my expectation and ideas that the company will do what‚Äôs right are gone."
"Does the LR4 still use metal sensors? Our LR3 is driving me nutsLong story short our LR3 keeps setting off pinch detector and cat sensor faults.

We've had it for years, and I've done all the hacks online for the pinch detector but at this point it happens daily and I'm just over it.

So those familiar with both, does the LR4 have that stupid pinch detector still (always seemed useless since the robot stops anyway when weight is applied), and does it rely on metal for it's detectors or is it all infrared lasers now?

TIA"
"When to remove old litterbox?Hello, my kitten has used the litterbot in front of me and when I'm not looking but also still uses the dirty litterbox (which I stopped cleaning to get her to use the new litterbot). When is a good time to reliably take the old litterbox away and solely rely on the litterbot? I was thinking of just doing it now since she uses it but sometimes I catch her sitting in it and doing nothing."
"anyone have an old internal shield I can buy?If this isn't allowed, mods, please let me know....I dont have FB so I have to rely on reddit haha
An internal shield is nothing that whiskers offers anymore and their recommendation was either to try to buy one off another person that wasn't using it, or try a pheromone spray and see if it helps

I will definitely try the spray but if anyone has an internal shield they aren't using, I would love to purchase it from you."
"LR3 waste drawer wasted ( space)Has anyone else noticed that when the Litter Robot 3 drops the waste into the drawer it primarily lands in the upper left quarter of the box?  

On my unit ( one adult cat) this can trigger the full sensor in as little as two days since the waste piles up right at the chute instead of using more of the drawer space. Been like this since I bought it two years ago. This forces me to either change the bag before it should be necessary or I can pull the drawer and 'shimmy' the waste to the far side. 

Can this be right? Any solutions? 

With frequent bag changing it feels like I'm adding more plastic than necessary to our environment. And it's concerning if I want to rely on it to work while out of town for a long weekend."
"Feeder Robot battery lifeHas anyone tested the practical battery life of the Feeder Robot?  It says 24 hours, which seems woefully low.  If power went out on a multi-day trip, I'd have to make sure someone is able to come feed them manually, several times a day.  I love the design of the robot otherwise, with features like food level monitoring, wifi control in the same app as my LitterRobots, front panel overrides, etc.  My current SafePets units work off 4 D batteries + wall power.  And the D batteries will last 6+ months if you relied on them.  I was hoping the backup unit the FeederRobot could at least handle a week.  I wonder if the battery could be upgraded somehow (warranty voided of course).  Thoughts and experience are appreciated.  With wifi alerts, I guess I would know if the power went out.  Maybe I'm overthinking it."
"No outlet for Litter RobotI'm moving to a new place and considering getting a litter robot for the 2nd floor. Unfortunately there aren't any outlets in the area where I'd like to place the Robot so I'm considering maybe getting an indoor generator to power the device. 

Has anyone had success with this? Or does anyone have any alternative ideas? I'd rather not have to rely on an old school litter box but it does seem like that may be my only option."
"Altering the Litter Robot?My single kitty is older, so she probably uses the box twice as often as a younger cat. So the volume is the same, but the frequency is higher. If I have to go away on business or vacation, I wanted this to last her about a week, as advertised. But my problem is that the receptacle fills up after 2-3 days. So I have some questions:

1. Firstly, does this box measure fullness by the number of times it cycles, or does it rely solely on the height of the pile? I'm tempted to clear the full alert and see how long it goes before it becomes a problem.

2. Secondly, (and it hurts to ask this), could you conceivably cut out the bottom of the tray, put the LR on a slightly elevated platform so that the bag would hang lower, thus collecting more waste before tripping the sensor?"
"App not turning LR3 back onSo we have the LR3 Connect and the app. Everything has been going great, except for the last 4 days.

We went on vacation 5 days ago and wont be back for another 3. We have someone coming by to feed our cats, but they arent around enough to make sure the LR is operating as it should.

The LR has suddenly been giving us multiple cat sensor interrupted faults, and will get stuck for hours. I am guessing once it was stuck upside down for too long and one of my cats pooped outside the box (according to cat sitter).

I thought I had a smart idea by turning on and off the LR remotely with my app... so that we limit the cycles to twice a say. But it wont turn back on via the app!

Obviously something is wrong with the LR that will need us to troubleshoot and clean when we get home, but I'm hoping theres a quick fix to this power on issue in the meantime!

It will also be really annoying if I cant ever rely on the app in the future to turn the LR on and off when I need to."

"Give me your honest truth!My husband and I are in disagreement about whether or not to get a litter robot because he claims it has horrible reviews. Now, I‚Äôve read the bad reviews, but they seem to be the minority. From what I can tell, the majority of people who have a litter robot love it. 

I am most likely going to buy one regardless since he‚Äôs never scooped litter in his life and it‚Äôs my realm of management anyway. 

BUT I would like to know allllll the pros and cons before I buy since it is prettyyyyy expensive lol. I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs a pain to clean, that they break (but are covered by warranty so that‚Äôs mostly just annoying?), they are big, etc. plz elaborate on these points and any others you think of. Is it user error?"

Have you tried the App‚Äôs customer support? If you haven‚Äôt then you should! There is a FAQ section, a section about all the different color bands, and there is even a section with additional troubleshooting that is not covered in the manual or FAQ section."
"are they worth the price tag? honestlyI'm trying to convince my husband we need one because we have 2 cats and:

-they really love a clean box
-our house is small and we only have 1 box so scooping often is a requirement
-I think having the ability to not scoop for a few days sounds amazing to me, like leaving for an over ight trip and not having to worry they'll go outside the box

What do y'all think? Is it worth the insane price tag?

How has it affected your happiness and routines?"
Honestly shocked how much quieter LR4 is when running
"LR4 Users - Honest Opinions PleaseI'm looking to upgrade from my LR3, I've read the reviews about the LR4 but hoping to get more honest feedback here before taking the plunge.

My biggest complaint with the LR3 is the difficulty I have cleaning. Mine gets pretty stinky after 2 weeks that I need to hose it out. I've found that the inside construction has a lot of crevices where no matter how many times I cycle or empty, litter still gets trapped. From the photos, it looks like this may be resolved in the LR4, but I can't really tell."

"Honest Litter Robot 3 long-term reviewWith the Litter Robot 4 on the horizon, I thought I'd share my honest long-term review of the previous version after having used it for the last 3 years.

# What's Great

* ***Your litter cleaning chores are drastically reduced***  
I went from having to clean my litter box every day to cleaning the box once a week. This is a huge time saver and it makes taking care of cats much easier.  
This is especially if you have pet sitters while you're on vacation - if you're gone for a week, they won't have to clean any litter at all, and if longer, they'll have to do it maybe once or twice.  

* ***Being able to check your cat's usage metrics is great***  
I've learned that my cat uses the bathroom a lot less when I'm on vacation (probably sleeping all day), and have been able to track if she's had irregular bathroom use. The historical data is useful to get a good sense for how much you expect your cat is using the bathroom and whether they're going more or less often than normal.  

* ***Cleaning mechanism still works great***  
Despite the abuse from my cats (i.e. trying to use the litter box while it's rotating, attacking falling poop), the mechanisms for cleaning out the litter still work great. I'm pleasantly surprised by how well it's still functioning after all these years.

# What's Not

* ***It will SMELL***  
It was great at first: hardly any litter smells, recommended deep clean once a month.  
But after 3 years of use, the litter robot smells very quickly/easily no matter how hard I try to deep clean the thing. As with certain types of plastic products, bacteria builds up over time and seems to more easily hold on to that bacteria the more you use it, and this is true for the litter robot.  

* ***TRULY deep cleaning this thing is a pain in the ass***  
It looks easy from all the marketing videos that you're shown, but if you really want to clean this thing well, it's going to take you a over an hour (and you'll want to do this more frequently as your Litter Robot ages).
   * The base can't be sprayed down with water and does not dismantle easily, so you'll be sticking your hands into corners to try to get at the weird angles, while smelling cat piss all around you.
   * The globe seems easy to clean but there are several spots that are a significant hassle to get to which aren't advertised as areas you need to clean - under the rubber bottom of the globe, and under the sifting area (where the litter slides into during a cycle).
   * There's also gasket foam that's used to prevent the sifted litter from falling out of the edges of the hole. I had to take apart the sifter piece and I accidentally damaged the foam, so I had to use my own rubber sealing (same ones used for insulating doors) to get a solid gasket in place.
   * You HAVE to clean these areas because they build up smell over time.  
(There are zero instructional videos on how to do any of this by the way)  

* ***Cats can stop the cleaning cycle***  
If you have a really playful cat (especially younger ones), expect them to attempt to crawl into the LR while it's running. This will cause it to stall and sometimes not resume without user intervention (needs a full power cycle).  

* ***The WiFi controls do not work the way you want when you need it***  
If your litter robot gets stuck and needs the power to be cycled to resume it, you can't use the remote controls to turn off (it just completely turns off the unit and you have to physically turn it on again). That's a pretty glaring issue with the hardware/software design.  
I've solved this by installing a separate wi-fi controlled power plug that I can cycle power on, but then what's the point of even giving me the power option in the app if I can't turn it back on??  

* ***Being limited to using clay litter sucks***  
I used to use wood litter for my cats. They're lighter, produce less dust, naturally eliminate odors much better, and are much more environmentally friendly.  
I've absolutely hated having to switch back to clay litter with the LR and wish I had a way to continue using my wood pellet litter. It would be nice if the sifting piece had alternative, adjustable sizes for different kinds of litter.

# TLDR; Summary

I've really liked using the LR, but I really expected more longevity with the amount of money I spent on this thing. My 3 main issues with the LR are: build of smell over time, hassle with ***true*** deep cleaning, and limited litter choice.

If you're sensitive to smells like me, you'll end up spending more time cleaning your LR as it ages. I'm at the point where I'm making a plan to switch back to a regular litter boxes - at least I can properly and easily deep clean those, AND I'm not spending over $500 if I need to replace it because of odor issues.

I don't own the LR4, but from what I've seen in the marketing videos, these issues don't look like they've been fixed (i.e. still can't easily remove the rubber bottom, still can't easily remove the sifting area, still looks like cheap plastic that will eventually hold onto smells, still can't use different non-clay litters).

I would have highly recommended this when I first got it, but unless you want to either be a) spending over an hour deep cleaning your litter box every month, or b) spending another over half a grand on a new LR, I don't recommended getting one."
"Litter Robot Filters Reviews - My LR4 Broke in 2 WeeksI submitted a review 2 weeks ago on the Litter Robot 4 describing the absolute disaster I had. It was a completely honest review about how my LR broke within 2 weeks and support would not respond to my emails. The review never got displayed on their website. So, I guess I'll post it here to try to save anyone from wasting their money on this product. My review was a bit more brief, but this was my experience with Whisker and my LR4:

I ordered the LR 4 on March 30th. It shipped on April 1st. I received it on April 7th. It worked fine for a few days and I loved it! But then it started stopping mid cycle when it ""detected a cat"" - the only problem was that no cat was near it. It would move a bit, pause, move a bit, pause. It probably took 5 minutes to complete a whole cycle. Sometimes, I would have to reset it to get the cycle to complete. I cleared the sensors, but the problem persisted. A few days after this initial issue, it started having constant Over Torque Faults which showed up as Motor Faults on the app. This caused the LR to get stuck mid cycle. It would not resolve the issue itself - it would only be corrected by me resetting it. This was very inconvenient because if I left the house, I would not be there to fix it! \*\*I never filled the litter up past the line. It was always about 1cm below the line. The litter was not the issue.\*\* This problem continued for a few days. In an attempt to fix this issue, I followed Whisker's troubleshooting page. I unplugged it, emptied the litter, took the lid off, took the globe out, and vacuumed up any loose litter. I cleaned out the globe, put it back together, and refilled it with the appropriate amount of litter. I used regular litter and, of course, made sure not to fill it past the maximum line. Eager for this mess to be over, I plugged it back in and it couldn't even do the initial cycle. Over Torque Faults were happening again. It wouldn't even go back to it's normal position because of the Over Torque Faults. At this point, I was completely over it, but I still wanted it to work! On April 20th, I emailed support describing my issue, what I did to try to resolve it, and asked them what I should do. They replied on the same day telling me to go through the troubleshooting guide. Well, duh, of course I tried that! Despite that, I still went through the steps again to ensure I didn't miss anything. I did not. And the LR still did not work. Even worse, it stopped turning completely! In my setup, I made sure that it was lined up on the tracks correctly, so it was not my fault. Even though it was not turning, it still complained of Over Torque Faults. I emailed them back the same day telling them that I had already done the troubleshooting and that it now does not turn at all.  They did not respond until May 7th (17 days later). They said that they would like to send me a replacement unit and that they needed me to confirm my address. I responded the same day confirming my address. On May 12th, I still had not received confirmation of shipping or a confirmation that they received my response. At that point, I was ready to just return this thing! It had been sitting in my living room for the past 3 weeks as a $730 regular litter box. I sent an email that day saying that I would like to return it instead. I also submitted a request for a FedEx return label. Fast forward to May 22nd, and I still had not received a response from support or a FedEx label. I decided to call support instead. I was 39th in line, so I requested a call back. They called back 2 hours later and emailed me a return label. I sent it back on May 23rd. It was delivered on May 31st. I got an email today saying that they received it and the refund is processing (for the full amount). The lack of urgency and the terrible response time throughout this process was insane. I've seen countless posts and reviews about support being good, but they were terrible for me!

The funny thing is, support just emailed me back today (June 7th! A whole month from their last response!) saying ""Thanks for reaching out to us. We're always looking to improve. Thanks! Whisker"" LOL!

TLDR: My LR broke within 2 weeks, support would not respond to me, and I had to pay $60 to send it back (plus $15 for a huge box)."
"LR4 Refill Litter NotificationMaybe I am missing something but I have all of my Notifications turned ON under Settings in the app. I would think that when the litter level says ""Refill"" you would get some kind of alert or notification on your phone. I usually do check on it once in a while but honestly if I don't get any error or full drawer notifications I don't pay it any mind. Is there a way to get a litter refill notice so I don't forget to do it?"
"LR3 keeps stopping mid-cycleI was very excited to get our first litter robot last week but it's honestly been a bit of a pain. Many times since I've set it up the machine has stopped mid-cycle. The yellow light will flash and then I have to go and restart it, which kind of defeats the purpose of getting it. It is quite annoying considering the cost. Any advice on how to fix this? It's not touching the wall or on an uneven surface or anything. Thanks!"
"Honest opinions for LR3 + smell preventionI‚Äôve been debating getting a LR for years. I have two cats. Old fashioned boxes and scooping are the bane of my existence, especially because I always feel like I can smell it regardless of how often the boxes get deep cleaned. I hate having gatherings because I‚Äôm paranoid of being nose blind to the smell. 

I‚Äôve been wanting to wait for the LR4, but it‚Äôs taking forever so I might just get the LR3. My plan is to keep the LR in our 2nd floor laundry room. 

What are your honest thoughts on smell? What tips do you have and what litter have you had best results with?"
"How to get your litter robot set up for success.This is my third litter robot, brand new, model 3 without Wi-Fi. One is working just fine, and the other needs some parts.

To be honest, I've taken my robots for granted for a while now. With too many cats using one, it can get pretty messy. So here's my question: how can I set up a new litter robot for success? Specifically, is there a way to disable some of the sensors without losing any of the functionality?

As you may have guessed, it's that weird sensor that always seems to get covered in cat litter during the cleaning cycle. Any ideas or advice?""

Edit+  just a quick reminder to myself: don't go overboard with the cleaning liquids on the metal part of the litter robot. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!"""
"One of my cats won't use the box and I'm afraid of a UTII have 2 Siberians- an 8 year old and a 1 year old. My 8 year old has taken to the box just fine (other than interrupting the cycle out of curiosity). My 1 year old was apprehensive, but when we removed the old litterbox, he seemed to be better. He went 3 times with me luring him in with treats and toys, and even one time all by himself. But in the last 3 days he refused to go in at all. He pooped on the floor and did not pee for over a day. My husband and I were scared he would get a UTI so we put his old box back out (which is a jump-in style privacy box), and he's used that 3 times in just 12 hours. 

I'm thinking that the problem is he's a pretty big boy (15 lbs) and very furry. Two of the times he used the robot, he ended up with peepee fur around his butt, which never happened in his old box. I think this may have deterred him from using the robot. He's honestly a big dummy and just might not understand how to use it without getting dirty. Any tips to get him back in without risking a UTI?"
"mundane positive LR4 review\- had a lot of trouble getting my cat to use the LR4 at first 

\- the switch back to clay based litter was a little rough (was on Okocat before) 

\- two sensor fault scares that... just went away. still a little worried about what happened there 

but other than that, I haven't had any issues with the LR4. it sits in my spare bathroom and I will forget about it until I get the drawer full alert, which is about once per week. I still like getting the notifications so I can check frequency and make sure all is going well in cat-bowels-land, but honestly this thing has been very pleasant and useful. with this and a simple auto feeder, I've been able to leave my cat alone for up to 4-5 day long weekends with no issues. her poops are absolutely demonic on the dry food required by the feeder, but that's a) my fault and b) resolved with the LR4 itself. 

just thought I'd leave some thoughts for other prospective buyers as I know usually we only post here with questions or problems."
"Fence that's being send out for backwards peeing cats is an absolute failI just received the ""new"" fence in the mail that is supposed to help with pee leaking down into the unit in between the seal and the outside case. It's just a piece of clear plastic taped to the original fence, but it seemed to not cover the area properly when I installed it. Tested it with water and a syringe to see what happens and it's an absolute fail, the water leaked right down inside the unit again. 

I reached out to the support and the response they gave me was that they are working on a solution and that the unit essentially wasn't designed for cats who face any other way as butt in and face out. Honestly ridiculous given that we pay a hella lot of money for this thing. You can't just assume that a cat is gonna behave in xy way and always pees in a certain position, thats not how cats work. Given how long people complain about this issue you would think they have it resolved by now, but nope. 

If anyone knows a 3rd party seller that offers a solution please let me know, I'm unfortunately not 3D printer savvy, but I would assume the original fence design with just an angled extra piece in the back that hangs over the gap would do. Heck, if you're someone who can design something like that I'm ready to throw my money at you, I just really want a solution for this problem."
"Poop Sticking to DrumPlease help. We are at our wit‚Äôs end. We adopted an 8 month old Bengal, our second,  and his poop is all constantly all over the drum. He poops in the litter, but during the clean cycle it streaks everywhere. I think the problem is he is a big cat (12 pounds) and eats like a tank while he is still growing. We are having to scrub down the side of the box several times a day to stop the smell. Our whole office reeks. 

We‚Äôve tried changing the delay time to 30 minutes to allow more clumping time, and we‚Äôre using Arm and Hammer Clump & Seal which seems well-liked in this sub. Honestly, when we only had one cat using it the box still had a musty odor. We can empty out the tray and within a couple uses, the room smells like stale cat pee. 

We are using the LR4, bought in October and I feel like we wasted our money. Between the smell and poop-covered drum, we‚Äôre doing more work than before. Help. üò≠ I read all the threads with similar questions and none of the suggestions for odor or streaking have helped."
"Which litter robot to purchase?I‚Äôm currently looking into buying a litter robot and I know some people having issues. I just wanted to know, right now, which litter robot has the least problems? I see a lot of people comment that have the LR 3 and 4. I have two cats and this is a big investment so I‚Äôd like some honest opinions. 

I already know that I‚Äôll have to deep clean it once a month and that I might have to trouble shoot every so often, but I‚Äôm OCD about the litter boxes and have to scoop all of them several times a day and I think it‚Äôll still be worth it for me in the end.

Any insight would be super great, and if any of you have promo or referral codes I‚Äôll gladly use those too."
"Mold in waste basket... Switch litter?Hi everyone, I have a different automatic litter box (Petkit Pura X), but this sub is much larger so I thought I'd ask the LR community as well. Recently, I've seen white fuzzy mold grow in the waste basket (looks like cotton filling). I've been using Arm & Hammer Slide multicat purple box. Clumps well, great odor control, low tracking. I honestly loved it until mold started to grow in the waste basket of the automated box. (No issue in the regular boxes). 

Obviously the basket is an enclosed environment prone to fungi and bacteria. But has anyone found that switching litter solved it? I found old posts asking for help, but I'm not sure what if anything fixed their issue. AH has baking soda in it, so I would think it should prevent mold better than other litters, but maybe not? I'm looking into Boxiecat extra strength red and Dr Elsey. Has anyone fixed the mold problem? Is Boxiecat red better than pro for an automatic box because the clumps are supposedly harder? Which Dr Elsey works best in an automatic box as far as clumping, odor, and low tracking? Thank you!"
"Litter Robot Success Stories !I've been reading quite a few poor reviews about Litter Robots lately, and I agree with the thinking that people who are unhappy about an issue are overwhelmingly more inclined to write about it online than satisfied buyers who will simply enjoy their purchase and say nothing.

So to balance this out, lets post some success stories!

Ill go first.  My Litter Robot 3 went into service 3 years ago and I have had NO problems with it at all.  It's still working perfectly today. What's amazing is that I do about ZERO maintenance. I empty the drawer when the app reports it's full, and walk away for another week. I'm using Fresh Step clumping liter with Febreze.

In 3 years I have taken the LR3 apart and cleaned it outside twice. And honestly, it really didn't need it.

Lastly, NO I don't work for Whisker and this is not a paid endorsement. I'm just a guy who stopped scooping poop 3 years ago and couldn't be happier.

What's your success story ?"
"My house smells worse with LR4Unfortunately you get used to the smell of your own house but my mom came over and I asked her honestly what my house smelled like. 
I was mortified by the answer. It smells like a dirty little box‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had nothing but issues lately."
"LR4 - smart scale is just wrong and can't resetGot the LR4, and to be honest the setup and first day has just been a series of frustrations.

Seems to be mostly functional now but the [smart scale](https://i.imgur.com/9WWEHo3.png) is just plainly incorrect. I have one big boy but he's not even a 5th of that weight!

The LR4 is on a hard floor not touching any walls. I've tried switching it off for 30 seconds in the hope it would reset. Tried that DFI recalibration as well all with no luck.

Is there some documentation on how to properly zero the scales?"
"Mold in LR4I've read a few threads on this but I'm still having issues.

I have a LR4 and am using boxiecat pro deep clean.  I have 1 cat. The entire robot sits on the [https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-mat.html](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-mat.html). I noticed that since the robot is entirely on the mat, it might be blocking the vents on the floor of the robot (the tiniest bit).

By 1 week there is white, cotton candy like mold in the drawer (using a plastic bag as liner).

The boxiecat pro deep clean litter doesn't really do a great job with smell which makes it seem like a great mold environment. Pre-robot I used smart cat grass litter and it didn't smell at all. I'm surprised w/ all the stellar reviews but honestly not loving this litter (besides it's great clumping/non sticking to the globe features). 

I sprinkle baking soda at the start of the week generously in the drawer. The robot is not near a humid environment.

Maybe I need a litter w/ baking soda pre-mixed? Or maybe move it off the mat entirely? I looked up reusable mini dehumidifiers but it won't fit in the drawer (Height dimension is limiting, only 5.5"".

Ideally I'd like to change the liner once a week w/o seeing the mold. Has anyone cracked this?

Thank you!!"
"Whisker Support is Outstanding!Honestly, for all the flak they've been receiving they really helped me get my issue resolved within a timely manner. 

I will definitely be purchasing a LR4 in the near future after this experience."
"Yellow light flashing rapidly ‚Äî only starts working again after couple of daysHello guys,

After only 3 months of use my LR3 started having this stupid error ‚Äî blue light flashes and when I press ""cycle"" it starts flashing rapidly. I do everything suggested to make it work again (clean pinch detector, etc), but none of it works. However, if I just leave it off for a couple of days without touching it and then turn it on again, magic, it starts the cycle and everything is fine for another couple of days...but then...again the same error...

Why this happens?? I honestly think this was my worst purchase ever. It was like buying sand in the desert ‚Äî a worthless waste of money."
Drawer Liners for LR4??I have the whisker liners for my unit but I‚Äôm now on base #3 and I‚Äôve had to empty the drawer so many times when it‚Äôs 1/4 full. What does everyone use for drawer liners? I honestly don‚Äôt think the ones whisker sells fit very well. They‚Äôre huge.
"My experience/review with Pretty Litter and LR4I bought the LR4 around 4 months ago. Before that I have been using Pretty Litter with my cat for the last 4 years, primarily because the odor control was much better than any other litter I‚Äôve tried. Before buying the Litter Robot I searched for people‚Äôs experiences/reviews using Pretty Litter with it and I only found a few posts and some mixed reviews, so I thought now that I‚Äôve been using it for a while I‚Äôd share my experience here in hopes it might help other people. 

First of all: Does it work? Yes! At least for me, it works almost perfectly. One bag of pretty litter fills up just about right to the fill line. Also, since I used to use a bigger litter box with 2 bags per month, now that I only use one bag per month I‚Äôm even saving money. The only slight weirdness to keep in mind is the ‚Äúlitter level‚Äù reading on the app won‚Äôt work, it will always think the litter is low since it is based on weight and the Pretty Litter weighs a lot less than normal clay clumping litter. 

With the litter robot I find that the pretty litter in fact lasts even longer than it did before when I was scooping it manually, because when it spins some of the litter that is covered in pee drops down along with the poop, even though it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúactually‚Äù clump. This also has a bonus effect that you can still use the health monitoring feature of the litter by just opening the drawer when you get a notification that the clean cycle has finished and you will likely see the colored crystals. In the normal litter box a lot of the time by the time I scooped, the color would have mostly faded unless I scooped pretty soon after my cat happened to pee. 

Also, the odor control has been excellent in my experience. I read some reviews on here which said the Pretty Litter caused the litter robot to smell really bad, which honestly I haven‚Äôt had any experience even close to that. The few times I tried other litters before (several different ‚Äúodor blocking‚Äù clay litters, also pine and corn) they all smelled significantly worse. 

Another plus is that since not as much litter gets wasted forming pee clumps, the waste drawer fills up very slowly and the litter doesn‚Äôt significantly deplete to a level where I have to add more. I only have to empty the drawer around once a month which also matches with the same frequency I switch out the litter to a new pretty litter bag which works well since I can just push the ‚Äúempty‚Äù button and remove the waste from the month along with the emptied litter. Since the waste is still covered with crystals, it doesn‚Äôt actually smell bad, at least with just my one cat using it. Wiping down the globe is also usually pretty easy, unless you waited too long to switch the litter and pee started to stick to the side (the litter does kind of lose its absorbing power at about the 5-6 week mark in my experience with one cat) although you can just mix it around some with a scoop before emptying to mitigate that issue. 

My cat learned to use the robot pretty quickly, and even keeps sticking his head in there while it‚Äôs cycling which causes it to pause and continue later but it hasn‚Äôt had errors for that reason so far. I did have one sensor fault which I had to restart the robot, but I think that‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt wipe the sensors the first time I swapped out the litter so they accumulated some dust over the two months. 

Another negative it that it does track litter more than my old litter box which was a top entry where the cat had to jump in and out from above. And probably tracks more than heavier litter alternatives such as clay. 

Of course, my experience may not apply to everyone. I know for multiple cats pretty litter usually recommends multiple bags per month which obviously wouldn‚Äôt fit in the litter robot (though maybe you can also just switch it out more often?) I also believe the people with odor problems were telling the truth about their experience, though I can‚Äôt explain why their experience is so different from mine. Maybe different cats have different poop consistencies which don‚Äôt work as well with the non clumping litter. 

But if you find yourself annoyed by having to empty the waste bin a lot or the clay litter smelling bad and you don‚Äôt mind the additional cost of silica litter, I do think it could be worth a try. 

I hope this post is helpful to others who are currently happy with pretty litter and considering getting the litter robot, or vice versa if people are having problems with the clumping litter and want to explore an alternative."
"Constant Over Torque Faults with LR4I've had the litter robot 4 for a little over 2 months. I'm pretty frustrated because for the past few weeks I've been getting continuous over torque faults. For the past 2 or 3 days, it just hasn't been working at all. At least it was cycling every once in a while before, but now it just won't do anything.

&#x200B;

I've tried cleaning it multiple times today and vacuuming out any litter that might have gotten stuck in the crevices, but I just can't seem to find out what might be causing this. I also tried removing the filter (not even really sure what this does) since some people said it might be getting caught on that, but it still isn't working. I think I might have to get this unit replaced because I keep getting this error even when I don't have the globe inside of the base and try to run a cycle. I use World's Best cat litter which people on this sub has said is fine, but maybe not? I'm so close to the 90 days, I don't want to start trying new litters and potentially miss the window of return for this unit.

&#x200B;

It's really frustrating because this is actually my second LR4 since my first one came damaged (they replaced that one no problem). I really wanted this thing to work, but I'm honestly just feeling so tired of dealing with all these issues. It really sucks because this time I don't have the box it came in, so returning it is gonna be a really big pain.

&#x200B;

Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this issue? I'm at the point where I feel like I've just spent $700 on a bunch of headache. Scooping litter was never this hard üò≠"
"Yet another LR4 disappointmentI have had nothing but trouble with my Litter Robot 4 since it arrived. I was super excited about this product, and after a little less than two months I have found myself thoroughly frustrated with it and will be returning it. The two main issues I am having:

\- It always gets stuck in the cleaning cycle, and manual intervention is needed daily. I have followed the troubleshooting guide and all advice I could find with no improvement in functionality.

\- Pee pools in the tray area as well as inside the base/under globe area.

I spend more time troubleshooting and cleaning the LR4 daily than I did cleaning a traditional litter box. What pushed me over the limit was it getting stuck while I had a catsitter recently - she followed all my advice and looked up troubleshooting techniques on her own, and still could not get it to complete a cycle. She had to go out and buy a traditional litter box instead. 

I'm honestly baffled that \~$700 product is sold with potential for such poor functionality. Yes, there are many people who have functioning units and I wish that I had the experience those people, however the amount of people who have faulty ones or have to spend their time cleaning or troubleshooting their LRs just so it performs its basic functions is ridiculous.

I have initiated the return process and have ordered a roll-over style litter-box instead."
I would still buy it if it were double the price honestly
"Preferred litter type?Hey all, I recently purchased the LR4 and have been using Arm and Harmer multi cats clumping of some sort. I‚Äôm honestly not 100% the specific one. We have 3 cats and go through it pretty quickly. Does anyone have a recommendation on the longest lasting, best clumping, lowest tracking? I‚Äôm switching from a pellet and my boys have adjusted well but I am struggling with the grit. Thanks."
"I GIVE UP‚Ä¶I have been a multi cat customer since 2015.  Last unit I received in 2019 I believe. 

But as others have said, when working well , they are worth the cost and the 1/2 a room they take up in space.  I found them helpful for me with back issues, easier to change out bag than bend over for 5 minutes to dredge and scoop ‚Äú the old fashioned way‚Äù 

I‚Äôve also owned every other kind of box ever invented before these..

Owned a total of 4 litter robots open air 3‚Äôs with all the accessories and have maintained them meticulously, I still change the bag every day full or not. Use Elseys litter and deep clean every month or so. 

I agree they have all had their quirks and I‚Äôve had to replace, practically everything, and troubleshoot etc over the years. Spent thousands. 

Of course they are all out of Warrenty now. 

Recently one of the bases crapped out and I really needed support. 

, I tried calling and did not know the company changed hands. 

I emailed the ‚Äúsupport ‚Äú team. 
It‚Äôs been over a month. 

I threw out the fucking thing and replaced with the old fashioned scoop litter box. 

Now another is acting up. 

I just discovered this sub and see I have no shot in hell to get support. 

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LITTER ROBOT. 

Here is my assessment:
Biggest concern‚Ä¶ besides the CONSTANT trouble shooting, large Pees stuck to bottom, lights blinking , unit stuck half way around and blinking,to name a few.. 

This technology has actually ‚Äútraumatized ‚Äú my cats as they have gotten older. 

They are fine for young cats but when they become seniors and have mobility or health issues ( that they are trying to hide from other cats) I find the cats are hesitant to use box, circling around, making sure no other cats are watching until their waste spins out. 

1) If your cat has dilute urine from kidney, thyroid or other issues issues, the pee is large and usually sticks to the bottom no matter how much litter and how long you set the timer before spinning. 

This results in having to scrape and clean the rubber lining frequently.
10-15 minutes and replacing litter. 

2)  if your cat is large 15-20 lbs, they really don‚Äôt fit in there comfortably and again, my elderly cat started using the ‚Äúlip‚Äù to rest his butt on so pee or poo was left on the stairs, and the fence accessory only encourages this. 

3) the fence accessory is useless if you have a ‚Äúdigger‚Äù. Litter is still all over the outside of box.  Also litter somehow winds up outside the back of the box for no reason also and clogs the power supply inlet which fails at some point. 

4) If you don‚Äôt change the bag every day, your house stinks. Maybe this is improved with newer model, but when I saw the price went up $300, I say NO!

Since I went back to the old $30 scoop box, my cats use this box more than the robots that are left, and I suspect it won‚Äôt be long before the last 2 shit the bed. 

When they are ‚Äúdone‚Äù ‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôm going back to the $30 box. 

My cats are acting normal, not lingering around the box waiting for it to spin ‚Äú guarding ‚Äú against other cats, no more litter tracked all over than the LR, and I have a sense of ease not reacting to blinking light, or stuck and unusable entryway
Not coming home to a nasty surprise üí©, or having to unexpectedly trouble shoot when we are exhausted. 
( we fight less about this too)

Frankly my husband and I are too old for this shit, and so are our cats. 
I can‚Äôt imagine having a Wi-Fi and notification feature so that you can know that there are all these problems While you are not at home and cannot do anything about it.



This seems like a really stupid idea.



So, just my two cents, and frankly if I had had prompt customer service to resolve some of these recent issues I may not feel as strongly,

But all around this is a bad product and terrible way to treat loyal customers."
"Should I continue to stay away?Hi! 

I have been following this sub for a while and was thankful for the honest input from all the users here‚Äîunfortunately for LR it has kept me from purchasing the LR4. I have never had a LR before, and really wanted the 4 to be my first unit because it looks soooo much better than the older models. I don‚Äôt really have the space to hide it away, so aesthetics is a big factor (and obviously the convenience and decrease in smell). 

Now that it‚Äôs been a few months since it‚Äôs chaotic release, has customer service/ticket times improved? People that have gotten the LR4 more recently, are you still experiencing problems? Reviews seem to still be mixed. 

Should I continue to wait for them to iron out these major kinks? Some of the stuff I‚Äôve seen in here is pretty horrifying‚Äîcat pee in the wrong place is no joke, and neither is a 700 dollar product with peoples hard earned money on the line. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy to even ask, but it seems a few people on here have been happy with their product, and I‚Äôm dreaming of a life where I no longer have to scoop."
"Insanely strong and vile chemical smellLR4 out of nowhere started smelling a smell ive honestly never had the misfortune to smell in my 25 years of life. The smell is literally so bad that It woke me up at 5am. It was strongest in the litter trash bin and especially the bags, even the ones that were inside not yet used. I threw them all away as they reeked with whatever this chemical smell is.


I then deep cleaned the litter bin and the smell was gone from it. I place the bin back in with a normal trashbag and 3 minutes letter i pull it out to smell and good lord it was back with the same intensity.


I have no clue where its coming from but it seems strongest at the filter vent area.
At this point i will PAY to have this gone. Jesus christ. Typing this at 6am while i need to work in like 2 hours. 


Made sure everything is clean but the smell is still coming from the vent area and this doesnt smell like cat feces or litter. It geniunely gives off a cancer causing smell.

Ive had it for a week now.
 Has anyone experienced this?"
"Overall happy with LR4 - couple comments / questionsHey everyone! We got our LR4 beginning of December, so it‚Äôs been about a full month of usage. Noticed some faults because of one of my cats moving the litter outside of the fill line, so got a smart outlet plug to make it easier if we are gone.

Overall it‚Äôs been good. I‚Äôd say just a couple things like this morning it was stuck upside down ish, pee clumped in multiple spots, had to manually clean that and all, reset, etc. back to normal. (Little worrisome there).

Also, noticed im having to refill litter quite often like every 3 days I feel like. Honestly not sure if it‚Äôs gonna be a litter saver or not. 

1. How often do you all refill litter? How often to completely dump and replace? We use BoxieCat litter. 

Sorry if this has been asked before!

Just not sure if it‚Äôs worth keeping or returning. Seems like a decent amount of maintenance - cleaning (spot and deep clean), fidgeting when problems, refilling litter a lot, still tons of litter on floor. Saves time from scooping but just thinking."
"I asked Bing Chat to create a story about a little boy and a litter robot 4Oh yeah, the story is also meant to be fun for 40-year-olds.

"An honest reviewI‚Äôve had the litter robot for almost a year (July) and it has not been a great experience. The only thing stopping me from going back to the traditional pan litter box is the price of the LR. And I didn‚Äôt buy it! 
I have two tabby cats (4 years old) one of them is a bigger cat but she‚Äôs not the size of a maine coon or a rag doll, yet it seems like its too small for her.. here are a few of my frustrations/complaints. 

1. Since the LR is a dome shape.. when she is in the LR doing her business, before her urine is able to clump it travels downward toward her back paw as she‚Äôs in their.. since it‚Äôs not completely flat. I am constantly having to clean urine and litter off of her back paws when she‚Äôs finished. (This happens to my bigger cat almost every time, whereas the smaller one it happens, but not as often).
- being able to put more litter in might help, but the a slight excess in litter causes the LR to malfunction (see #3)

2. When the LR cycles, litter sticks to the liner all the time, and it‚Äôll also stick to the top of the dome. So if I don‚Äôt clean it or check it after each use, the next cat goes in and their fur rubs all over the inside of the dome with stuck litter clumps and where litter clumps were sifted through which leaves residue all over the inside regardless.

3. If you add litter that is a tiny tiny bit over the line, it will stop cycling and sit in dump position until you fix it. Any little thing will cause it to stop mid cycle. Sometimes I have to just shake it a little and it will continue. But if I‚Äôm not home and this happens... means no usable litter box for them until I get home. We all know how that goes..

4. It stinks! And we use scented litter. (Never had a problem with the smell using same litter with a regular open air litter pan). It makes sense why it would smell... I would prefer a litter box that doesn‚Äôt. 

5. If you don‚Äôt wrap the litter bags around the back part of the drawer, you‚Äôll have litter that misses the bag and gets into the drawer. 

6. Cleaning that thing is a real pain. Disassembling and taking it outside and hosing it down and scrubbing to get all the stuck on litter off. Then leaving it out to dry before putting it all back together. 

I use scoop away litter and I‚Äôve tried the LR brand litter which doesn‚Äôt help and stinks even more because it‚Äôs unscented. Still sticks, still dirty, urine soaked paws and very expensive. I‚Äôve tried another litter also but can‚Äôt recall the name. I bought the LR spray to clean it in between deep cleans but it‚Äôs just not working out. 
The LR is a lot more work than a regular litter box, it‚Äôs unsanitary, and it smells. It is not worth all the trouble."
"Leaving my two cats with an LR4 for the first time ‚Äì update!I wasn‚Äôt sure about making this post, but I decided that it‚Äôs a good thing to do to balance things out. Whisker gets their fare share of well-deserved criticism on this sub, but I‚Äôve [recently posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/yso6e0/leaving_my_cats_for_3_days_for_the_first_time/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that I was about to leave my LR4, which I‚Äôve now had for a bit less than two months with my two cats for 4 days. I honestly anticipated needing to power cycle it a couple of times, but to my surprise ‚Äì there was not a single error in 4 days. It functioned flawlessly. I did leave a backup box, but it looks like my cats only went there once, vastest majority of waste was in the LR4. So far this week, it‚Äôs gone through 52 cycles without a single error, it is running the latest firmware. I don‚Äôt do anything special except using a powerful air compressor to blow air into sensors every couple of days (takes seconds) ‚Äì I‚Äôve started doing that after experiencing the red bar issue every once in a while during my first month of ownership and it has helped tremendously.  

So yeah, just wanted to let everybody know that LR4 can be an amazing thing! Clearly there are many issues that people are having, but I hope Whisker keeps updating the firmware and will figure out the situation with ordering and, most importantly, support."
UghWell‚Ä¶ 700$ for the LR4 and it comes cracked and honestly seems to be made with the cheapest material possible
"Having tons of issues on the LR4 and its only a week oldSo is it just me, or does each Litter Robot keep getting less reliable with each generation? I had a LR2 that lasted a really really long time and was practically bulletproof until something started to warp and while it still works, it often gets off the tracks. LR3 was reliable for about 6 months and then became extremely problematic, stopping most of its cycles half way through. Replaced almost every part in there and still doesn't work. Ordered a LR4 hoping they had made something more like the LR2 this time but bigger and with all the tech. Nope. This thing is flimsy AF. The bonnet will not stay on it. I keep getting sensor errors on the app. And this morning I found a small plastic piece in the drawer, still not sure where it broke off from or how.   


I put in a support request today, but honestly I think I might just return this. It's absurd that this thing costs as much as a decent washing machine and is built so cheaply."
"Best ramp for LR4?I‚Äôm at my wits end with my senior cat‚Äî she usually uses a covered modkat box so I thought the L4 would be an easy switch- large, more open, etc. 

But she‚Äôs peeing all over the carpet instead if I leave the modkat box dirty, and only used the LR4 2x in the last month. I find myself frenetically patting the carpet every day looking for suspicious wet spots. 

She has a touch of arthritis and though it doesn‚Äôt stop her from jumping on my bed once in a while, I do see her hesitate at the edge of the couch, etc. wondering if I can solve this with a ramp bc the carpet and my sanity cannot take this lol. 

Does anyone have a reasonably affordable ramp option for the LR4? I‚Äôve seen the ramp scratch pad suggested but the incline seems a little steep if I‚Äôm honest. 

(Have already done treats training, the bot is off, full of her old litter‚ÄîI‚Äôve been trying to treat it like a regular scoop box so it‚Äôs full of her old okocat and filled much higher than would normally function just to make it more appealing and‚Ä¶ no dice)"
"Is robotshop legit? Tired of waiting.My 13 year old cat has gotten super picky with her litter box. If it‚Äôs not SPOTLESS she will take a big ole steaming dump right in from of the litter box. 


We took her to the vet and got a clean bill of health so we are guessing she is just being picky. 


We ordered a white litter robot at the beginning of the month hoping the white would ship sooner but are honestly tired of waiting.

I saw that robotshop.com shows they are in stock and shipping the next day. I‚Äôm thinking about canceling my order from litter robot and just ordering from them but was not sure if there is a downside or if they are legit."
"LR3 is dead. Suffer attempting at an LR4 before 2025, get another LR3, or find an alternative?So my LR3 finally died. The cycle light is flashing yellow, but there are absolutely no obstructions. I've had this thing for \~5-6 years, which is supposedly above the LR3 life expectancy.

I attempted to buy an LR4 months ago but canceled the order since support ghosted me. Checking in today, phone support is unavailable and online support is also unavailable. I'm guessing the horrible customer service is still prevalent and has not been resolved.

Do I suffer attempting to purchase another LR4 and hope it arrives before 2025? I'm guessing customer service will never, ever help me if there's an issue and I'm expecting it to arrive pretty much in Q3 of 2023 given how horrendous the service has been and the constant complaints still ongoing.

LR3 is available on Amazon, so I can just... buy that, I guess, but honestly, Whisker has been so horrible I prefer to not support them anymore even though the LR3 was awesome. Alternatively, are there better alternatives than LR?

Thanks!"
"Litter Robot 4 mini reviewUPDATE: I tried a bunch of a different litters. Each time they work for a day or two and then the litter robot literally freaks out and throws a million overtorque issues even when its empty during the cycle. Finally got support to send me a new one and hope we don't have anymore issues. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have had the LR4 for about a month now and wanted to give my opinions on the machine to help some of you guys out.

So right now, I'm using the LR4 with Dr. Elsey's litter.

I'll start with the good. When it wants to work, its amazing. Don't have to deal with touching or picking up litter is just so convenient. The app works fine although I had some issues with setting up. There is also no smell from the LR4 either. I live in a somewhat small apartment so not having to smell cat piss or shit all day is great.  Cleaning it is pretty easy too. I like that I can just pull the globe out. The weight counter seems pretty accurate although at first it was a bit off so seems like it takes a week or two for it calibrate?

Now with the bad... they did not even email me when the LR4 shipped. I sent a support ticket asking when the LR4 was going to be shipped. They get back to me about half a week later saying mine was already delivered. I was so confused, I check my emails and the website and no trace of a tracking number or telling me my order was shipped. I checked my mailroom and there it was, just sitting out. I live in an apartment and the delivery people sometimes do not understand where to drop off the mail so sometimes they leave it outside in public so its really important for me to get tracking so this irked me a little.

Its been kind of a headache dealing with the LR4. The colors that show up on the indicator don't even show up in the manuals or anything so troubleshooting can be a huge pain since I'm just guessing on what is going on. Luckily the app will tell you whats wrong with it sometimes.

I am having this issue with constant ""over-torque"" errors. After some testing, it seems like Dr. Elsey's litter is just too heavy for the LR4. The way it clumps also has it stick to the walls so I think the robot has issues pushing that weight through the cycle. It sucks that the motor is so weak and we have to fill below the fill line to get it working. So if you get the LR4, I would try a lighter litter.

Support has been awful to be honest. They say they will reach back out to you and they never do. They tell me to send a video and they can't provide an email or number that I can send it to so they can review it while they are on the phone. They just say they will review and get back to me and its been about two weeks and I haven't heard back.

Seems like I have to do a bunch of tests to see what works with the LR4 and what doesn't. When it works, its awesome but when it doesn't work, its the most frustrating thing in the world. If you are going to get this thing, I highly recommend the extra warranty because I have a feeling, I'm going to need to use it and some point."
"Two broken units in less than a year, they kinda suck huh?Just discovered this subreddit, glad to see I'm not alone. Not sure if y'all will see this though considering this subreddit is moderated by LR themselves... Just had my 2nd LR3 break in less than a year.

Seems support has been really slow in replying recently, how have everyone's response times been in general? Why are we paying such a ridiculously high price for clearly cheap hardware with nonexistent quality control?

Honestly, at this point, scooping seems easier."
"is the LR4 upgrade worth it or should i stick with the LR3??The title basically says it all. I like the sleek look of the 4, but it looks like that's the main upgrade. If someone that has owned both can tell me otherwise I'd appreciate a few honest opinions and experiences. Thanks!"
"Caution! No Support From the CompanyUpdate 10/24/2022: Received satisfactory service from the company. Case closed. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought a Litter Robot 3 on in December 2019, along with a 3-year warranty. A couple of months ago my litter robot developed a problem ‚Äì it consistently got stuck halfway while cycling.

When it is stuck, I can solve it by pressing the ‚Äúoff‚Äù and ‚Äúon‚Äù buttons, unplugging the power, or moving the robot a bit; then it will continue to cycle through. But now it is getting worse ‚Äì it is stuck 2-3 times during 1 cycle, so now it becomes burdensome.

**My 1st attempt** to contact [support@whisker.com](mailto:support@whisker.com) was on 9/21/2022. I sent an email with order number, purchase date and warranty information. I received no responses. **Case #00983949**

**2nd attempt** was on 9/27/2022. Received no responses. **Case #00995076**

**3rd attempt** was on 9/30/2022. No response. **#00995076**

**4th attempt** was on 10/4/2022. No response. **#01000615**

Before I post my experience on other social media, I am going to wait a few days to see if they will contact me. If not, trust me I am going to post my complaint everywhere online until I hear back from the company.

Honestly, I am very happy with my robot. I was considering buying a Litter Robot 4 for my 2nd floor. But this really ruined my experience, especially since I purchased a warranty with it.

New buyers be aware"
"Those who upgraded from a 2/3 to a 4. Truly worth it?My pinch sensor just went out on my LR3 non connect and this is the last straw I think. I have had issues with the pinch sensor since the first week but this time I am positive it is no longer the physical connection but something on the board. Between pinch sensor issues and the unit not registering my cats and the shallow waste basin, I am ready to curb this thing. The thing that kills me is that I don't even need the pinch sensor as my cats don't ever attempt to go near it when active.

All in all, I am fairly critical and disappointed in my unit.......but......the LR4 DOES have me intrigued somewhat. Are the pinch sensor, non registering cats, and waste basin issues fixed? If so, I might be able to be convinced that an LR4 may be worth it. Looking for honest feedback from non professional reviewers. Thanks.  


Also, do the official LR accessories like the steps work on the LR4?"
"Second LR3 Connect or LR4?So I have three cats and adhd. I got my first litter robot about a year and a half ago and it has been a life saver! At the time I only had two cats, but I‚Äôve since acquired a foster fail who is a permanent staple in my house. Because of this, litter usage is up big time. I tried adding a second plain litter box, but in true adhd style I would completely forget to scoop. I try to keep up with emptying the tray, but I‚Äôll be honest and say a lot of times it gets the best of me. 

I‚Äôve thought about getting a second LR to try and help even things out, but I can‚Äôt decide if I should get a second LR 3 connect or just make the jump for the 4. For those of you who have upgraded to the 4 (or one of each) what would you suggest? If I‚Äôm going to spend the money, I want to get my moneys worth."
"LR 4 Owners‚Ä¶i‚Äôve owned the litter robot 3 and several PETKIT litter boxes. I really like the PETKIT Pura max, but I‚Äôm having issues with urine leaking out of it (not on the carpet but within the unit) because my cat loves to piss on the side of it. I can still clean it and it‚Äôs really good litter box honestly. the waste gets emptied into a container that has a lid that closes automatically. honestly this solved my issues odor issues with the horrible odor from the LR3, but I wanted to hear from the owners of the LR4 to hear how the odor is."
How often do you deep clean your robot?I feel like I‚Äôm having to clean mine so often because one of my cats is constantly peeing and pooping on the side of the globe instead of the litter. I have to take it apart and deep clean it at least once a month; and I should probably do it every two weeks if we‚Äôre being honest but it‚Äôs such a painü•≤
"There's some (blue) light at the end of the tunnel (Review so far)Model: black LR4

Litter: sustainably yours multicat

\#cats: 1

location: bathroom, tile floor

ordered: early july

received: late august

I've been trouble shooting this pretty much since I got it one way or another but I had some confounding variables.

Issue A: Cat had some trouble adjusting to the LR. confounder: I was adjusting him to it at the same time we moved into a new place so that definitely contributed to him taking his sweet time. It took about 3 weeks for him to start using it exclusively.

some things that helped him to adjust were:

\- keeping the litter robot off for the first few weeks, and manually cycling it. Gradually exposing/conditioning him to the cycling (i started by first only cycling it with the door closed, then cycling it with the bathroom door open, graduated to cycling it in front him while giving him some pats and a treat.

\- Dr. Elsey's cat attract  litter additive

\- praising him when I saw him use it (he's a people cat so this works, YMMV)

\- tossing a lumps of pee from his old litter box into the LR

\- not cleaning the old litterbox

&#x200B;

Issue B) a million cat detection alerts/ phantom cycling: updating the firmware did help with this thankfully for the most part. This still does occur multiple times a day but it's dramatically reduced. It was cycling like more than 20x a day before and now maybe it does that 5x.

Cleaning the sensors with compressed air once in a while also helped with this.

I will say that some people in previous posts mentioned that the sensors may be triggered by floor vibrations. I live on the second story of an apartment building facing a fairly busy street so there are plenty of vibrations. Also kinda gross but the apartment I moved into has a few small roachies (hard to avoid them in the area that I live in sadly, despite meticulous cleaning). I've seen them scurry into the sensor port and set it off a few times. So if you have some unwelcome roommates in your own place, they may also contribute to this.

Issue C) Red light of death: again updating the firmware, turning on/off a few times, making sure the robot isn't on a grout line or touching any cabinet or walls has helped remedy this issue. Also I always turn the LR completely off when I refill the litter, clean it, empty the drawer etc. anytime I have to mess with it in anyway it's completely off which has helped keep the red light at bay.

So far this issue seems to have resolved.

&#x200B;

unresolved issues:

\#1) litter level often usually reads at low: confounder is that I suspect that the litter I use is lighter weight. It's kinda annoying but not a huge issue since I can visually see the litter level every day and top off as needed. Still debating on if I should change to another brand that isnt Boxie cuz dass expensive lol.

\#2) there's some odor: especially when it cycles and exposed the waste drawer to the air (understandably). I've added in A&H baking soda deodorizer with minimal improvement. May be due to the type of litter I use also. Regardless I empty the drawer every 3-4 days no matter the fullness and overall the smell is the same or less than a traditional box.

\#3) there was one time when the cycle got interrupted and the globe got stuck halfway thru sifting. I turned it off/on, tried manually triggering the cycle and it seemed jammed. I had to take off the bonnet and jiggle the globe to unjam it and get it going again. Luckily it was on a weekend, when I was home. If this had happened at work (I work long hours), it would've been a problem, and I'm sure I would've came home to some lovely pee on my bed.

HOPING & PRAYING this doesn't happen again especially when I'm at work one day.

&#x200B;

Overall: I'm content and I've been seeing blue bars mostly for the past few weeks.

It was a bit of a rough start, but I've seen improvement in performance, and am hoping future firmware updates will only make things run smoother. I do still feel like I'm figuring things out regarding cycling timing, litter to use, etc but I am a first time LR user.

I wish it didn't have such a steep learning curve, and honestly idk what I would've done without the support from this subreddit. Those things make this purchase sting considering the price tag. It should definitely have many of these kinks ironed out when you pay $600 for a litter box.

I would still recommend this if asked but with full transparency about my issues. If it was good to go out of the box I would sing praises."
"Litter Robot 3s suddenly offline, unable to get them back online again?Hey LR users, has anyone else had their LR suddenly go offline and can‚Äôt get them back online? Nothing about our internet, wifi, setup, power, etc has changed since we initially set them up in January and until a few weeks ago we didn‚Äôt have any problems. It‚Äôs weird how suddenly it happened to two different bots.

We went through the entire process of changing the network (through Whisker) and after naming the bots and putting our wifi information in it‚Äôll say everything is connected and ready (so no hold ups or error messages during onboarding) but never actually come back online. 

We‚Äôve tried hard resets, changing the wifi name, deleting and re-adding to the app, moving the wifi closer, turning Bluetooth on/off, using airplane mode, and just about everything else we could find online with no luck. LR support has not been helpful either. 

Has anyone had this happen before, and we‚Äôre you able to fix it?

UPDATE; We we‚Äôre finally sent replacement power supplies and LR3 basses (one for each LR) and after setting them up we were able to successfully onboard. We still aren‚Äôt sure what happened to the old ones to make them go out like that, but everything they asked us to do to troubleshoot failed so they sent replacements. One support person told us it 100% had to be a problem with our wifi (which was never an issue before) but that pretty clearly wasn‚Äôt the issue. 

If you‚Äôre having the same problem I‚Äôd honestly just save yourself the time and jump straight to getting replacement parts. Best of luck to you all!"
"Missing my okocat‚Ä¶tips?I used to use the okocat original mixed with the low dust okocat pellets‚Äî I have never really used anything else other than wood/pine litter for my cats as it‚Äôs easily available in my area, so I had forgotten what regular litter made of clay smelled like. 

 bought a box of Arm& Hammer Slide because I had heard that it worked well with the LR (just got my LR4)  but I was honestly stunned by how strong it smells and how it makes the room smell like a ‚Äúcat room‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm smelling urine or waste because the robot is clean, but the litter itself has such a strong smell. I mixed in a handful of the remaining okocat, but found that any more than that and the robot would just dump all the okocat into the bin because the chunks are slightly too big. 

Am I crazy?? Is this just what clay litter smells like, or is Slide a particular offender? I‚Äôm in love with the LR concept and my timid senior cat finally plucked up the nerve to start using it, but with the okocat people couldn‚Äôt even tell I had a litter box in the room‚Äî now I‚Äôm in the room next door and can still smell the fresh litter! 

 Would love to hear perspectives, and also recommendations from anyone who has found something similar to okocat that is LR compatible!"
"From Hacked to Constipated, a short storyI have the litter robot 3 with wifi. Got it a few weeks ago now. 

I have it displaying the last time they went to the bathroom on my infopane (tv with pics/etc). It just lets me know that they're using it and when I need to empty it without opening my phone. 

But anyway for me to do that I have to store my username and password in a text file and use a Python script to log in and grab the poo from the litterrobot API servers. 

With that background, here goes the story:

My litter robot was going off every 30 minutes to an hour last night. For the life of me. I couldn't figure out why. I kept going over there and taking it apart and trying to figure out if something was stuck or something was wrong or maybe a bad sensor.

Eventually I got the idea that maybe it was hacked and somebody is spamming the empty litter button on it. (They must have read that text file right?) I went on my litter robot account, changed my password, and changed the write, read, and execute permissions on the actual password file. (But let's be honest if somebody was on my system/network reading that file, I'm going to have bigger issues.)

So I was telling my spouse about how paranoid I am about this. Then we end up seeing my cat in the litterbox. 

As it turns out, my cat was constipated. I watched him go in there unable to use the restroom several more times that evening. I unplugged it and the next morning he left me a present.(I checked his stool, he seems ok)

So it is useful in letting you know that your cats are having issues. 

But of course my nerdy ass went immediately to ""oh no, I got hacked""

Learned how easy it is to disassemble."
"Cat using the litterbox incorrectlyI know the title sounds weird, but I'll explain. I recently got a litter robot and set it up in the same area my old litter box is in. One of my cats took to it almost immediately, my other cat not so much. My ""problem"" cat (not using the litter box), poops in the litter box just fine, but peeing is another story. She gets halfway in, then starts to pee. The problem is that she is backwards and pees all over the floor in front of the box. Ive tried putting her in the box and petting her, giving her treats, scratching around to give her the right idea and nothing has worked. It's honestly creating more work for me than a regular litter box did. Anyone have any similar experiences, or have any advice on how to fix it? Id love to figure this out so I can keep it, but its pretty expensive for a glorified decoration haha."
"Poop Diaries: Struggles of Rick James The Ragdoll vs LR3**TL/DR** \- bigger cat poops outside LR3, never did with LR2, I tried buying the steps bc i thought it was joint related, i tried multiple different brands of clumping clay. No dice. I think the angular division of space inside the box creates a different slope on roof and bottom of globe which makes it easier for paws to get stuck in wet clay. Cats don't want to step in their pee and poo. Have purchased Fence accessory, will try to see if it helps and update this thread. Would love it if Litter Robot and Whiskas could really show up for loyal customers and offer to exchange these for the LR4. It's the right thing to do for some of us.

**UPDATE 2:** we've been giving it a shot for a while, and he still ends up pooping outside of the box every once in a while. At this point, I would simply say, if you have a bigger cat in terms of 20 lbs and up, and I mean big as in SIZE not a big belly lol, I CANNOT recommend LR3 for the exact reasons I've mentioned in this exhaustive look at the physics of the device. Your cat might be big and might use it, but there is a high probability that it wont be comfortable for them, and when you think what percentage of a cat's life the bathroom visit takes up, it's just not right. Hopefully the LR4 will deal with this issue. I can already tell they've improved the aspects that I think are failures in the design change of the LR3. Unfortunately I will not be able to grab one as the pricing becomes more prohibitive with every new release of this robot. But you don't have to be me. 

**UPDATE:** so I installed the fence, and so far for the past 2 days we have not had any fehicular mishaps outside of the LR3. I will continue to observe and will be back in about a months time to give another update. I'm only doing this to help ppl out. I just want to mention again that the design of the globe is the actual problem here.

I went from the litter robot 2 (and both of my cats using it fine for 11 years replaced some parts on it though) to the litter robot 3 last year. I have a black short hair, and a large Rag doll, the Ragdoll stopped pooping in the LR3 and poops right in front of it. So let me run you down what I did and my process real quick:

\- First, I thought maybe it was a joint issue. He's getting older and this litter is at a bit of a weird angle and the step is designed very differently, so I bought the steps. Seemed to kind of do the trick for a little while, but not really. Strike 1

\- Then, I started noticing that he'd have litter stuck on his back paws (he uses the litter box backwards and poops and pees near the entrance. The stuck litter issue, never ever occurred on the LR2. I thought, okay it's the litter I'm using maybe? Switched litter 3 or 4 different types of EXPENSIVE Boxit, and cheaper clumping clay. No difference really except he doesn't get it stuck in his paws as much anymore (I'm guessing this is due to him pooping outside the box though lol)

\- Finally, I'm where I am today, and I honestly have very little belief this will make a difference, but I've bought the ""fence"" accessory and will be applying it as soon as it comes in the mail.

My thought process through all of this is that he's a big boy. Like a 24 pound fuzzy big boy. There has to be something going on with the internal geometry of the Litter Robot 3 that wasn't going on in the Litter Robot 2. I can tell you that the way the top of the rotating ball is designed is different enough in combination with what feels like some sort of measured difference in the way the bottom of the ball is designed. Clumps stick more, and clumps track more across the top of the ball. That's just the truth of it. Hate it or love it. It was NOT a problem in the LR2. I think the angular difference in the roof and the bottom creates a situation where pee spreads out more (which would normally be a good thing) but makes it more difficult for bigger cats to maneuver in a way that keeps their paws out of the wet clay. Also if you were a previous owner of the LR2 you'll notice that the LR3 globe is mounted at an upward angle of like 35 degrees, more or less, where as the LR2 was parallel to the ground. ***It'd be nice if Whiskas could release some sort of contraption to adjust the angle of the globes if we want to so that they are, much like their previous design, parallel to the ground.***

Personally, as a really really long time lover and customer of this product, I'd be ecstatic to be on their team and try out the LR4. I'd be happy to do an exchange for it with them. I'd be over the moon to be honest because I think they know what mistakes they made and it looks like they've purposely improved on them. But I sincerely doubt they'd do anything like that for me or my kitts. They're just so expensive to buy, it's prohibitive to upgrade for me after I spent money on one just last year. Especially in Canadian rupee. It saddens me because my dudes are senior citizens now, and I want them to keep living their best lives. I can't get mad at my buddy when he poops outside the box, he's not doing it to piss me off he's really self-conscious about it and knows it's not good, but it's not his fault. *It's my fault, and to be honest, it's* ***Litter Robot*** *and now* ***Whiskas*** *fault* as well and that's exactly why they've made the mouth of their LR4 so much bigger, in order to give bigger cats the ability to navigate better in the ball/globe. **I will update this when I get to test out the fence**. My idea is that it will allow homie to feel where he's at because of the higher ridge, and allow him to be more precise about not stepping in the wet clay spot. It's a pipe dream, and these additions have defo cost me money. It is what it is. They're family. Ya'll know that.

PS: Just want to add that I NEVER do things like this. I NEVER write these kinds of epic (need 100 hours to read) reviews and I always blame myself for buying bunk products. I actually really do believe this could help a potential owner make a better decision about this product though, and I never see anything highlighted anywhere that mentions this in full detail for people to understand that it is not a one-off experience and will happen to your kitt if he/she is a similar build. This is a purpose built apparatus for cat defecation, and it costs around $800 with tax.

"My 4 month review of the Litter-Robot 3**Product rating: 9/10**

Let's just get this out of the way now - this product has *changed my life*! 

After posting in this channel back in August this year I was convinced by the replies here to go ahead and purchase at Litter-Robot 3 Connect, and boy I wasn't disappointed. 

My two young cats (just over 1-year-old) took to it straight away, were very curious about it from the get-go. They didn't need much training, we had their old litter tray next to it and put some of the litter into the robot so they would get used to the scent but after a few hours I'd got the notification that one of them had used it! After a couple of weeks I took the old tray away and voila, it was being used 3-4 times a day. 

No real downsides, only that it took me a little while to find a good litter that works well. We like to use sustainable clumping litter, but to be honest most of them have granules that are too big to into the holes in the litter-robot globe pocket. Also sometimes I get a sensor fault but no discernable issue when I go to check on the unit, seems to carry on working fine - so bit of a mystery why it does that but it doesn't stop working.  

This product makes cat ownership so much easier, honestly, if you can afford it - get one. I've been waxing lyrical to my friends, they thought I was crazy to spend that kind of money on 'toilet for my cats' but I think it's totally worth it. As cat owners, I'm sure we're all guilty of not cleaning out a litter tray or two because we're exhausted or super busy, then feel guilty because we want to make sure our cats are happy and healthy. The Litter-Robot certainly helps me keep them that way."
"My issues with LR4 and you need to be aware before purchaseI have both LR3 and LR4. After about 1 week, I realized the strong odor I constantly noticed was coming from the inside and I took the globe out. A little bit background: both of my cats like to pee against the wall and there's no issue with LR3. However, the front of LR4's rotational globe is kind of separated from the frame and significanly lower than the LR3 (which is one piece), causing urine leaks into the base and creates an urine reservoir inside LR4 base. I mauanlly drained the urine, and wiped clean the base A LOT of times but it's still smelly. I am waiting for response but I higly doubt they can solve this issue. Most likely I will return it.

Honestly I do like the new sensors, connect features and quiet some improments compared to LR3, but due to the leaking issue it's not usable at all. Considering how much trouble it brought to me, it's definitely the most disappointing purchase I've ever made.

"Cat refuses to set foot inside litter robotHi everyone, I was lucky enough to receive a litter robot for Christmas this year (yay!), but made the mistake of plugging it in when my cat was in the room (nooo). She saw it cycle, and wanted absolutely nothing to do with it. She has never had an issue with litter box swaps before. She LOVES clean litter, so I thought it would be easier than it's actually been. I was very wrong.

Methods I've tried since then:

* Cold turkey - First day I took her old litter box away (it was also an enclosed one) and put the exact same litter/some of her pee/poo in the LR. She kept walking over to the LR (I placed it exactly where the old one was), but refused to set foot inside of it. She eventually went to the bathroom on the furniture
* Old litter box - I put the old litter box back, and put the LR right next to it. I've even put the old litter box on a cardboard box to make the entrance the same height as the LR. We've completely stopped scooping - it's been a week and it smells absolutely horrific, yet she still goes in there multiple times a day. I guess I have a particularly nasty cat?
* Litter attractant - Litter in the LR still has pee/poo bits, as well as a bunch of litter attractant in the litter, and catnip on the front step thing
* Treats - I give her treats twice a day in front of the LR, and lure her up to where she has to put her head up by the entrance to get the treat. She doesn't mind being in front of it or near it to nab a treat. She just has zero interest in it.

I don't know what to do next? I have a feeling she's going to use her old litter box even when all of the litter is completely clumped up. She honestly could not give AF that it is stinking up the entire house. I know I messed up in the beginning by plugging it in, but is there anything else I can try? Has anyone had to return their LR before?

Edit: thanks all for advice/personal anecdotes! Maybe I'll give it another week or so before I give up and return it. I'll try out some suggestions below!"
"How to get around a manual reset every cycle?After digging on the internet I learned how to manually reset the globe (unlatching the bonnet and physically moving the globe back to the home position). But as soon as it goes to cycle again it becomes stuck in the upside down position. Every time this happens all of the litter is emptied out. Does anyone else have a better method of troubleshooting?
  
I am two months in the trial period and getting tired of fighting my litter robot. I want to love it as much as a lot of posters here do. If you could export my app history into Excel you can see I‚Äôve only been able to successfully run a cycle less than a dozen times since receiving this in June. It sits in my living room as a $690.99 spaceship looking covered litter box. If I average the cost over the years the cost won‚Äôt be as noticeable but I‚Äôm disappointed as I thought a high price meant quality. I left an honest and more detailed two star review on the website and am curious to see if it passes the review process and ends up being posted.

Edit: [screenshot of my app](https://imgur.com/a/TN0wsIU) over a three minute period including a manual globe reset. Now imagine doing this for 10+ minutes!"
"Litter Robot 3 Crevices - Normal?Hey guys, so I bought an used Litter Robot 3 off of someone on FB and I thought it was working perfectly fine, and honestly it was...but one thing I couldn't stand was the smell. I couldn't understand why it smelled so bad even after I washed it multiple times. 

Then today, as I was getting ready to clean it, I realized that there were crevices that I hadn't gotten into before, but I was wondering if it was ever a problem with you guys or if the previous owner just hadn't screwed things in/put things in correctly....

And could you guys let me know if you have problems with a litter robot that smells? Everyone in my family is saying to get rid of it, but I might get a new (wifi) version...

Thanks in advance.

"My cat likes me more since having a litter robot.I have 4 cats and honestly sucked at cleaning the litter box‚Ä¶ so I bit the bullet and spent the $700 for the litter robot. It took about 3 weeks for everyone to adjust to it.  Now that we are all acclimated to using the litter robot..: my most stand offish cat is OBSESSED with me. She also hated my lack of litter cleaning the most.  She cuddles with me all the time and wants all of my attention and I am amazed by this. Lol I also feel bad because I was such a terrible cat box cleaner that I think she had some serious hatred towards meüôÅ anyway, just another reason I LOVE the litter robot. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough."
"DIY Upgrade for the Litter Box Credenza for containing litter and smellsMy wife and I did a DIY upgrade for the Litter Box Credenza, and I wanted to post it here in case anyone else wants to do something similar.

While we really like the look of the Litter Box Credenza, it comes with an open side which allows smells and litter to come out when our two cats hop out of the litterbox.

For this project we did the **following upgrades**:

* Closed off the open side with plywood and installed a cat door
* Built a two-level interior so that after using the restroom, the cats have to jump out of the litterbox onto the top level, turn right, go down a level, turn around, and walk a little bit more before reaching the cat door (this traps >95% litter). The cat door opens to the lower level. Cats can reach the litterbox by reversing this process.
* Installed some magnets on the inside of the credenza and the inside surface of the plywood
* Used some old carpet to cover the 1st and 2nd levels inside the credenza to trap litter

&#x200B;

I will say that this doesn't eliminate 100% of the litter and smells but it takes care of most of the problem. We also run an air purifier next to the Credenza to totally eliminate the smell. Useful if your credenza is in a part of the house that is highly trafficked.

&#x200B;

**Parts / equipment:**

* [Litter Box Credenza](https://www.litter-robot.com/credenza-white-plank.html)
* Litter Robot 3 Connect, but I think this concept will work with other Litter Robots (your shelf dimensions might change)
* [Cat door](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J2UH0S8/) (Depets Large Cat Door (Outer Size 9.9"" x 9.2"")):
* Plywood, 1/2"" thick, for both the door and the upper platform that sits atop the PVC
* PVC pipe and 8 connectors (3-way corner connectors). We used 1/2"" PCV pipe (has 0.84"" outer diameter). Honestly you could use any size within reason.
* [PVC pipe cutter](https://www.google.com/search?q=pvc+pipe+cutter&sxsrf=ALeKk012DYS48MTUfwR_IZTNPN1j6GPjCg:1621361024071&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizsZG_6NPwAhXoRzABHU7dAYcQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1280&bih=721)
* White paint, or any paint to match the credenza. My wife has done some scene painting and eventually wants to paint the side to match the credenza but hasn't gotten around to it yet. So for now it's white.
* [Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B4TW3YY/) for attaching the plywood side to the credenza
* Carpet - any old carpet you can find. You can get a small amount from a hardware store, or call a floor finishing store and see if they have scraps. We got ours when we moved into our house, the previous owner had replaced the carpets and left the scraps.
* Zip ties for holding the plywood 2nd level to the PVC tube frame. You'll need to drill holes in the plywood so the zip ties can be passed through
* Binder clip to hold carpet onto the plywood 2nd level. You can fix it with carpet tape but we opted for binder clips for easy removal and cleaning
* Tools - screwdriver, saws to cut the plywood, scissors to cut the carpet

I can provide measurements if people are interested, although this will require a little bit of trial/error to get it all to fit properly and still allow your Litter Robot to spin when the PVC/plywood/carpet contraption is inserted.

"What do you think about litter consumption compared to tradional litter boxes?When I first was thinking about buying the LR or any of the competitor products, I wasn't completely sure due to the price - it's quite an expensive product.

After using it for a year I'm quite happy with the product in general, although I've also suffered few problem with the LR stopping while completing cycles. To be honest I had more of these with the LitterMaid that I had, which was also an older technology and survived quite well taking into account its age.

That said, I've never regreted buying the LR and the fact that I save tons of time every month without having to clean 2 cats litter it's just worth it. One thing that came up while talking with my wife the other day is that the litter consumption has reduced considerably during the last year. This is because it gets cleaned fast and the cats don't try to cover it continuously, and therefore the clumping works perfectly. Considering the cost of the clumping litter in Europe (at least in Spain) that's been a massive saving with 2 cats at home, which probably does not pay off by itself, but it's a important factor when thinking about buying one of these devices."
"Opinion on 1 vs 2 robots w/ three catsHey everyone - I know there is a couple of posts about this and I have definitely been reading them but I just wanted to see if anybody else might have an additional opinion. I have two 2-year-old cats and just adopted one 4-month-old. Recently bought a Litter-Robot brand new after much research and can honestly say the reviews saying it is worth every penny is now an opinion of my own and then some‚Ä¶ üëè

I am writing this post because I do not want to have to change the waste drawer bag every 1-3 days. So I wanted to see what others‚Äô experience was regarding having two Litter-Robots and if have multiple (2) cuts back on the frequency of emptying the waste drawer.

That being said, I am definitely considering one of the reconditioned options because I am just too confident in this company. Want to save money for sure though. Love that the reconditioned option still comes with the 18-month warranty. I did purchase their Feeder-Robots (phenomenal) as well and can honestly say every single product has exceeded my expectations and I am so glad that I did not go with a cheaper knock-off version of the automatic feeders. So I will personally be justifying that purchase of an additional Feeder-Robot but really want to see what others have to say regarding having 2 Litter-Robots. I appreciate your advice in advance."
"How I Taught My Skiddish Cat to Use LR3For those like me who tried everything and all the suggestions and nothing worked... This is how I transitioned my skiddish cat to the litter robot with complete success and ease (when I started doing it right).


First off I made big mistakes. But that's good because it means you can still reverse some behaviors! 

I made a split decision to order the litter robot because I needed to leave town and I felt bad having my friend deal with the boxes and thought it would be easier. I ignored the advice that the company gave with transitioning because I am dumb lol. 

So I'm gone for a week. I return. Our litter robot is near an office and the other boxes remained in the guest bathroom. 

I assume they're both using the bot due to timing intervals and clean, collapse the boxes and store them. 

I later found a piece of cat poo in front of the litter robot. Uh oh... Someone has not transitioned. This was confirmed when I found another poo a day later in front of the bot. Knowing my boys it was likely Leo. He's the younger more skiddish cat. 

So I implemented everything. I put the box next to the bot. I stopped cleaning the box. I got litter attractant. I fed treats and cat nip. I modified the shipping box. I purchased the stairs, I moved¬† the litter guard, kept it unplugged...All these suggestions from litter robot and online I did everything nothing was working!!!

So I turned to Jackson Galaxy's YouTube channel. Although he is not a fan of this type of litter box... He understands cat psychology very well. His advice has always worked for training my cats. So I visited his YouTube page and started to research.¬† Clearly I am doing something wrong... And I was.. I didn't realize that Leo was afraid of the Orb. He didn't like going into it. He must have attempted while I was out of town and it scared him because it was moving. So I screwed up. That AND... 

I didn't use the jackpot treat. Galaxy talks about what he calls the jackpot treat that is something so amazing the cats focus on you relentlessly. For my boys that is chicken. They go CRAZY for it. 

My mistake was the greenies treats I was using required the cat to put his head down and not look at me while he ate. Galaxy discusses how you should use very small bits of the jackpot treat because the cat will focus on you completely and they eat it so fast that they keep their attention on you.¬† More on this soon.. because there are other critical things to address first.. 

So what I did was this: 

First I need to see if he uses it or not. So I ordered a Eufy 2k Pan and tilt camera off of Amazon. It's a little over $50 but you don't have to do any monthly payments to record things like Wyze requires. I've been very impressed with Eufys quality and ease and I can always see if a pet walks by the litter robot because it'll send a message to my phone when a pet is detected (you have to manually turn on that feature in the settings).


Now for the litter robot: 

Keep it unplugged. Do not risk the bot moving terrifying the cat again. It has to be safe and happy. If you're using the stairs make sure they're secured otherwise if they shift it'll scare the cat. Make sure the orb is locked in with the big plastic key thing in the back so it doesn't shift and scare the cat!

This is so important that I'm going to say it again. You have to make everything happy and positive. It has to be amazing and wonderful and great. NOTHING can be scary. For example when you change the bag in the bot do NOT shake the bag hard to get it open or that will scare the cats and associate the bot with being scary so don't do it! Be calm, happy, and gentle always around the bot. 

Any time I had to move the litter robot or clean it I did not let the cats see it so they wouldn't get scared. I kept the cardboard box over the bot to hide the orb and make it less conspicuous 24/7 as described in the litter robot video. 

Next I moved the litter robot to the guest bathroom and put it next to his old box. I even kept the cardboard on the robot to hide the scary orb there as well. They've known this room as the poop room for a long while. Let's keep it the poop room. I even had to disassemble the bot to get it through the door but it was worth it! 

Every time I emptied the base of the litter robot I put that excrement in the old box. I made the old box less and less desirable. But Leo kept using it still I was absolutely blown away. 

So here comes the treats. I put Max (older cat) in another room with an activity ball full of treats. I sat down with Leo at the bot and would give him treats on the steps to let him know that it's ok and it's safe and it's positive. Then I would get the chicken out. What I did was air fry it, shred it into small pieces, let it cool, and put it in the bowl. 

For NO MORE than 10 minutes at a time (training with cats must be brief) I would place very small bits of chicken on the steps or the litter guard rim. This is the JACKPOT. This food they adore so much and don't get as often as I now realize they probably should.. is now associated with the scary litter robot. But is it scary? I mean the best treat is now here with the thing that sometimes turns! 

So after some time of doing this I would pet Leo and praise him and give him scratches on his favorite spots on his head. Then we were done. It is always important to leave the cat wanting more. Never make them full. Try to train before meals. If you leave them wanting more they'll be willing to do anything...

Doing this I noticed.. Leo is starting to go investigate the outside of the bot on his own. He's looking to see if there is anymore of that amazing chicken at the litter robot! So he definitely has now associated the bot with the happiest thing in his life. 

He still, however, wouldn't go in. 

So for the next few days we do this again with the chicken. I keep associating that the bot is safe and ok. I never pushed him in the bot because if I did that could ruin all of the progress. That method has worked for some people but it's way too risky. You need to make them choose to go in on their own. 

So I got a bowl that I didn't care about and I put a bunch of chicken in the bowl. I showed it to Leo so he knew immediately wow that's a LOT of jackpot! He will do ANYTHING to get it! 

So I held the chicken in the bowl and very slowly pushed my hand further and further into the orb. VERY SLOW. Like JUST out of reach for Leo to get. He would get close .. slow down .. contemplate the decision .. move slightly closer only if I was just in reach. If I moved too far he would back away. But as I slowly lead the bowl further back into the orb he finally put a paw over. We kept this up until his front 2 paws were in. Then I placed the bowl in the very very back. He finally plopped inside with all 4 paws on his own! So I picked up the bowl and moved it around him so he would turn around and face his head outside of the orb. I then held the bowl immediately outside of the orb for him to put only his head slightly out to eat plethora of amazing chicken! 

He stayed in on his own. He chowed down. I praised him with a high pitch happy voice and I scratched his head which he loves. When he finished the chicken he stopped and looked around the orb as if he realized hey this isn't so bad either that or I wonder if there's chicken in here (again he ate it with the bowl just outside the orb so he's not eating inside of it) He then looked around a bit more and exited the orb. I praised him more and cleaned stuff up and we called it a day. 


The next morning I decided to take a big step. I went into the poop room and closed the door so I could clean the robot without scaring Leo.. and I decided that since Leo has realized the inside of the orb is not so bad maybe he will give it a try today. So I collapsed and cleaned his old box and stored it away. I made sure my camera was set up. I cycled and again unplugged the robot. I put that giant cardboard back on.¬† I always made sure to keep it cleaned up before they ate so they'd be more tempted to use it however I also would sprinkle their old litter in there so they smell it and know. It also helped that one time Leo used the old box next to me so I put some of what I knew was his inside the robot. 

On top of that I moved the litter robot in the exact spot the manual box was so his habit of going to that location in the room would be maintained. 

So he eats breakfast. I'm exercising across the hall. And I turn and I see him climb right in, do his business, cover it up, and hop right out. I was amazed. My jaw dropped. I watched and rewatched it on my phone from the Eufy camera! He finally used the damn thing!

So then what I did was I slowly transitioned it to the room I wanted to use it in. Some suggest daily moving it closer and closer... Honestly I went faster than that. But again I monitored with the camera to make sure he's still using it. He was! 

Now it was time to remove the cardboard. This could be complete nonsense but I was determined to not let anything screw this progress up. After w few days of him consistently using the robot I made my next move.

I waited until the sun would set (Leo doesn't have great vision) and with the cats locked away I removed the cardboard box so I wouldn't scare them. Then hid the box away from sight so they wouldn't think it was there to use for relieving themselves just in case. I kept the lights dim and who knows if this helped but Leo was ok with big orb being visible. 

Finally it came time to train that the orb turning is ok. What I did first was I got the cats in a position near where the robot is but out of sight. I got chicken out and I fed it to them while I then turned the robot on to cycle. The treats should happen during the entire cycle process and even slightly before. Now when they heard that sound it becomes associated with something great! I didn't want to do this too frequently or for too long because I didn't want them to RUN in the room every time it cycled expecting chicken. 

So the next day we did this again but in the room with the bot. Progressively getting closer to the bot with giving small bits of chicken. I watched Leo as he would look at the orb and then eat some more chicken then he would look at the orb as it spun. He became curious rather than scared. I made sure to keep the chicken far enough from the orb so they never have a temptation to climb in during the cycle. Instead it was maybe closest on the stairs just to show Leo the machine is ok when spinning but it's just busy. Otherwise we would do these sessions somewhat in proximity. 

Next what I did was I plugged in the bot and kept it plugged in. But I would use the sleep feature that way it would only spin when I'm home. So I made it sleep when I left for work and sleep when I slept! Keep the timer to 15min! This helps the cat get away and maybe sit somewhere else when it finally cycles and allowed me to sometimes find out when it was going to cycle. 

The first time it spun while I was home I gave a mix of chicken and greenies. Again just in proximity sitting nearby the bot. I'm phasing the jackpot out because he is using it and not very afraid of it.¬† 

I used my Eufy camera to monitor the robot. I finally verified that Leo is on his own climbing into the bot and using it for relief, and now completely content with the cycling. 

Cats do things for a reason. Their language and culture is so different from us that it can be very easy for us to judge their behavior for the wrong reason. 

I really really hope this helps someone out there. I did NOT want to return this amazing product. It has made my life so much easier and I definitely hope it continues to do just that!

EDIT: FYI with the Eufy camera if you use a micro SD card you don't have to sign up for that optional payment cloud service. Just get a 128GB micro SD card and you're set.

EDIT2: OMG i spelled Skittish wrong so many times lol. Sorry about that."
"HELP! Globe thinks upside down is home position, solid blue lightI did a deep clean for the first time today. Now when I reconnect the power, it does a full spin and then spins back to almost entirely upside down, like it thinks that's the home position for the globe. None of the lights are flashing. It just goes to the solid blue light like it's ready for use.

I did notice during the spin there is a pop and the globe shifts for a second like it's not on the track correctly, but I'm unable to determine what that is as I've checked multiple times to make sure everything is correctly placed.

I've checked the magnets, and I'm pretty sure they were put back in correctly, but I honestly don't know because all the info I can find about them is so vague.

Please help!!! My cat looks very unhappy that he can't go to the bathroom, and I need to get to bed üò≠ü§¶ Hoping I'm just tired and this is actually an easy fix.

Thanks for any help in advance!!"
"2 Weeks In, Cats Won't Use ItI bought a LitterRobot 3 connect because I was tired of arguing about who's turn it was to scoop, and also because my 12 year old Maine Coon mix drops some really nasty üí© bombs when she goes. I was also hoping the notifications would tell me when my younger girl is having another UTI flare. I have 2 cats, my stinky 12 year old, and a 1 year old. Neither are particularly bonded and each use their own personal boxes for the most part. We are now 2 weeks post set-up, and my 12 year old refuses to use it. The 1 year old is curious, but she's very jumpy and afraid of most new things. Honestly, if only one cat used it, I'd be happy, and would probably purchase another. But my 12 year old will not use it. We put it in her old boxes spot, have tried Dr. Elsey's attractant, catnip, luring them with treats, putting old litter in it, putting poop and clumps in it, letting her regular box get disgusting, and also just taking away her box (which resulted in her holding it all in for almost 24 hours). I need advice - both cats LOVE a fresh, clean box but they seem to not want to use it. I'm also hesitant to cut the box up as a cover/attractant because I'm worried I'll have to return it. Any advice is welcome!

Edited to add that we have a blink motion sensing camera, and also that the 12 year old decided to ""protest poop"" on the floor this morning instead of using the LR3

05/13 - I've given up and initiated a return. Neither cat would go near it, and I got tired of cleaning up cat pee and poop from the floor."
"Fence Options-LR vs. LRthingsSo my cat has scratched and ‚Äúremoved‚Äù the rubber part near the opening of the LR. No big deal. I did order some of the clips from lrthings.com but honestly haven‚Äôt had the time to attach them yet.

When it‚Äôs time for him to really go potty, he kicks *so much litter* out of the box, I mean just paw fulls. So I was just wondering if I could get feedback from anyone who has either the fence from LR or lrthings so I can hear any pros or cons. I think I liked how the LR one looked (and probably that it would be shipped to me a lot quicker). My boy hasn‚Äôt had any issues with not being ‚Äúin‚Äù the box enough when he goes potty, so the fence would strictly be for him to not kick out so much litter.

I‚Äôm also pretty sure that if I decided to get a fence, I would no longer need the clips to hold the rubber part on.

TIA!"
"How hands off is this thing?Hello! I've always wanted a self-cleaning litter box, but could never justify the price tag. Now that my husband and I moved into our newly built house and had triplets, I really couldn't care less what it costs if it means I don't have to scoop litter as often as I do now.

We have two cats and 4 litter boxes currently because I honestly don't want to scoop every day. Since putting our litter boxes in the basement (my dream after living in a 500sqft house for 7 years with the litter boxes in our faces 24/7), one of our cats has decided a particular spot on our brand new hard wood flooring (now needs replacement), the basement floor around the litter boxes, or our bathroom shower mat also make great places to urinate. All medical issues have been ruled out and I'm about 98% sure she's just angry that I can't keep her boxes perfectly clean.

So tell me, do you still have to scoop with this thing? How long can it go without being cleaned or changed? Ideally I would like to deal with litter boxes once a month - is this too far fetched even for a self-cleaning box that's $500?"
"One of those ""Should I?"" postsMy question is pretty straightforward. I've seen the marketing and have been distantly considering the LR for probably a year now. With Affirm now offering payment plans i'm much more willing. The astronomical cost was what prevented my purchasing the LR in the past. 

Reading this sub, i'm nervous about the number of glitches and tech issues people seem to have with LR. I dont want to buy a $500 rotating orb only to have it malfunction. The carbon filters seem like a gimmick that does nothing and people are talking about buying deodorizer powders and other such nonsense. I'm spending $500 on this thing - i should not have to then buy extras that I dont currently use! Then there's these special bags and these crazy accessories. This whole thing screams ""might be a scam"" and ""might be a godsend"" to me. I'm not convinced. 

I *hate* my current litter box. It's the Arm & Hammer sifting box. works well enough but it's not a perfect solution either. I've tried other ""automatic"" boxes before and they're all cheap garbage that are more effort than normal litter boxes. 

Anyone have honest thoughts to share for someone who's on the edge?"
"Any way to make this robot work normally again? Thinking about just throwing it outFor the past couple months I've been having frequent issues where the litter robot would simply stop cycling for no apparent reason (including right after pressing the reset button when I had just replaced the bag in the collection area below and added fresh litter). The app is also one of the worst apps I've ever used as the reset button either does nothing, resets the guage but nothing else or takes hours to enable the cycle button again (yes I've restarted my app multiple times and no the new app which is just a reskin of the old one does nothing better).

I'm well beyond my return policy already but I'm honestly thinking of just throwing the robot away and going back to a manual litterbox for my cats. As soon as the main chamber fills up and doesn't cycle my cats start taking their business right outside the machine which I have to cleanup just about every morning and cycle the stupid machine again.

I'm not sure how I tolerated it for this long (probably the sunk cost fallacy) but I'm kinda done with the machine. Is there any way to make it actually work again or am I better off just sending it to the dump and taking the loss on this machine after less than a year (bought it around September of last year)

The machine started out just fine for the first couple months but it's obviously not build to last more than 6 months -\_-

It's the RB-Ltr-121 Litter-Robot 3 Connect Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box (Grey) EU to be precise"
"Getting frustrated... Replaced 2 DFIs now and it still blinks BLUE.I honestly can't figure out what is wrong.. I've replaced the pinch sensors and the DFIs twice. It just fast (not hyper fast) blinks blue at be. I hit the reset button but it appears to do absolutely nothing. I've done the hand blocking reset technique to try to reset the system, but nothing works. 

I'm going to call customer care again tomorrow, but I'm starting to get pretty fed up and angry. $400 is a lot of money to me, and I don't want to buy another one of these things. Do they fix stuff for free if it's shipped?"
"Switching litter, is Dr. Elsey's still really dusty?So, I've been using World's Best for little over a year. I used to use Dr. Elsey's but switched away from a clay litter as at the time one of my cats was a long hair and she was getting it all caked up in her fluff. World's Best did great to eliminate that, but it's super finicky with the weight sensor and honestly I absolutely hate the smell of it. But it helped my Neko and that was the important part so I kept with it.

Unfortunately, Neko passed away last October, and my other cat, Kitty, is a short hair who never had any issues with clay litter. I've been trying to use the last of the World's Best I have on hand so I don't waste it, and am looking to switch back to a clay litter since the scent is just that bad and it tracks like crazy. When I had last used Dr. Elsey's, it seemed to get dustier with every bag, and wasn't clumping like it used to. I'd used the brand for years because how little dust it made, as the litterboxes are kept in my office and I was worried about what it would do to my computers. It was great for so long, but then seemed to just go downhill in quality. Anyone have any other clay litter options that are low dust/tracking/clumps good? I've been recommended Boxiecat but I've never tried it.

**TL;DR**: Does Dr. Elsey's clump well and have little dust like it used to, if not what other recommendations ya'll got?

Thank you\~ üò∏"
"LR2 cycling issuesHas anyone ever had an issue where their litter robot keeps turning to the left & instead of stopping at the dump position, keep turning until it hits the home position?

There‚Äôs a thread on robotshop I looked at. I also already sent the base in for a tune up. I just got to back today - I thought that the issue was with the sensor in the harness but they replaced everything & it is STILL doing this. I called but they were already closed. I‚Äôm so frustrated, the 2 is my favorite & the only one that fits in my bathroom. I have 4 open airs & had magnet issues with the one after I cleaned it & honestly, that‚Äôs what it seems like but the globe wasn‚Äôt taken apart, nor can I even find where they would be. Thoughts? ideas?"
