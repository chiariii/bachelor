* **Is Temi's navigation system based solely on lidar or is it using additional sensors or even image processing from the cameras?**
   * temi‚Äôs navigation system uses 16 different sensors. While the Lidar is in charge of building temi‚Äôs 2D map, temi actually ‚Äúsees‚Äù in 3D thanks to its array of depth cameras, proximity sensors, RGB cameras and wheel tracking sensors. The fusion of all these sensors is the invention in temi enabling it to recognize where it is, avoid obstacles and plan paths.
* **How can it help in the age of growing digital sales & e-commerce?**
   * temi‚Äôs position in the world of e-commerce is actually within physical retail spaces ‚Äì temi operates as a full turnkey solution from greeting a customer, to supplying info on products, calling in customer assistance via telepresence, AR fitting and POS.
* **Can you give an example of what types of apps will be in the new Temi app store at launch?**
   * When we envision the app experiences on temi we are envisioning apps for both personal and business uses, incorporating movement and Human-Robot interactions as much as needed and possible. We are working on some fun apps - like DeliveryBot, which allows users to easily deliver items and messages to different locations throughout a variety of environments, Guardbot which enables security features, A ‚ÄúReception‚Äù app for checking in guests, a variety of basic feature apps such as calculator, gallery and more‚Ä¶
* **Will the Alexa feature on the robot eventually have full Alexa show capabilities?**
   * Eventually, this is the goal. It is a process which requires development on both temi and Amazon‚Äôs side, and we are collaborating to make this happen.
* **What is your current focus with your home division? We see a lot of focus on your retail side, Will there be more focus for the homeowner?**
   * While we are giving bigger focus to the business sector these days, we are working on many new features and applications which will serve both sectors ‚Äì to name a few ‚Äì a web platform to control temi, partnerships with apps and service for personal use (music services, video streaming etc.) and more.
* **Can we have a setting that when Temi hits 100% charge we can pick a place for it to go so it doesn't overcharge**
   * This ability is currently available using the Auto-Return feature.
* **I really liked the Temi assistant. Can you continue development and make it a bit more conversational? Alexa is a bit stiff and instead of answering my off handed comments with sarcasm she just says "" I don't know"".**
   * We have chosen Alexa as a Voice assistant on temi due to it‚Äôs robustness, agility and vast capabilities. Alexa is constantly evolving, becoming more and more conversational and incorporating more commands and capabilities. Amazon‚Äôs capabilities and experience in the world of voice assistants is hard to compete with and we very much trust them to continue doing a great job in evolving Alexa.
* **With the new welcoming mode feature I realized that Temi screen doesn‚Äôt show you all the options that the screen have with the original screen just the 3 square; talk, walk, play. It‚Äôs there any way he can show all the icons like in the main screen all combined in just one? And also when will be able to drop in on others echo devices since Temi has Alexa built in? I know everything need a Process and time so I as a one of the Temi owners I‚Äôll be waiting for all that will come in the future ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüëå**
   * The ‚ÄúWelcoming Skill‚Äù is aimed to simplify the use of temi mostly for business environments. The welcoming skill is also a base for further development enabling you to customize and modify temi as you wish. The idea of the large icons on temi is aimed to assist users as they are farther apart from temi‚Äôs screen than a user usually would be from a tablet
* **Do you know if one of your developers is gearing toward an interactive AI assistant focus? Along the same lines according to one of your videos on the Temi website, Temi has object recognition. Can this be integrated into an AI assistant? Can Temi have a scheduling ability apart from Alexa with the Temi assistant? Thanks again guys. You're doing a great job!**
   * Thanks for the compliments! We aren‚Äôt aware of developers who are working on new AI assistants, but there are a few working on implementing regional popular ones such as Tencent‚Äôs DingDang or Nugu in S.Korea. As for object recognition ‚Äì this is something that can be controlled by an AI assistant just like temi‚Äôs movement is controlled by Alexa ‚Äì The object recognition however needs to be part of a developed app that incorporates such a feature. Regarding a scheduling app ‚Äì we will take into consideration in the near future.
* **Are you planning a cooperation with Samsung or any other (digital) Artificial Human project ?**
   * Not at the moment
* **Are you currently working on temi2 or is the main focus now to add features to the current gen?**
   * We are working on both on adding and improving features and capabilities, as well as working on an improved version of temi.
* **Can Temi work for Restaurant and small other businesses**
   * temi is built for business environments such as stores, offices, hospitals and hotels.
* **Does Temi respond to more than one persons voice? For example: 3 people in the house you only want 2 to be able to control Temi? Is that possible? Thanks**
   * Currently temi will act on voice commands coming from any user without difference. We are planning on personalization based on facial and vocal recognition in the future."

"I'm looking into itI chatted with them to find out more about it. I found out that the tablet portion is running Android but doesn't have connection to the play store yet. I also found out that when you're controlling it remotely it does its best to obstacle avoid but has trouble seeing things that are under 4 inches. At $1999 I'm skipping it. If they release the deal to where the pre-order got it for $1500 at one point I would be more enticed. 
I love the telepresence and sentry capability but I think that utility of this robot is very niche."

"Does anyone own Temi robot?I don't yet, but I'm considering buying one next year sometime. I want to wait to see how Temi performs from other user perspectives, plus I'd like to see Temi working at a b8ta store.

What are your thoughts on Temi?"

Can this be integrated into an AI assistant? Can Temi have a scheduling ability apart from Alexa with the Temi assistant? Thanks again guys. You're doing a great job!**
   * Thanks for the compliments! We aren‚Äôt aware of developers who are working on new AI assistants, but there are a few working on implementing regional popular ones such as Tencent‚Äôs DingDang or Nugu in S.Korea. As for object recognition ‚Äì this is something that can be controlled by an AI assistant just like temi‚Äôs movement is controlled by Alexa ‚Äì The object recognition however needs to be part of a developed app that incorporates such a feature. Regarding a scheduling app ‚Äì we will take into consideration in the near future.
* **Are you planning a cooperation with Samsung or any other (digital) Artificial Human project ?**
   * Not at the moment
* **Are you currently working on temi2 or is the main focus now to add features to the current gen?**
   * We are working on both on adding and improving features and capabilities, as well as working on an improved version of temi.
* **Can Temi work for Restaurant and small other businesses**
   * temi is built for business environments such as stores, offices, hospitals and hotels.
* **Does Temi respond to more than one persons voice? For example: 3 people in the house you only want 2 to be able to control Temi? Is that possible? Thanks**
   * Currently temi will act on voice commands coming from any user without difference. We are planning on personalization based on facial and vocal recognition in the future."
