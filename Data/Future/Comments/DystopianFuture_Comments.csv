"['A friend is a former San Francisco cop who essentially lost his career over tazering someone. He said that review showed that he followed training guidelines and policies, so he did exactly what he was trained to do in that situation, but the related lawsuits made for a bad look. The robots or drones, or whatever else, will be up against the same challenges, no-win scenarios for police response. One can imagine cut and dried scenarios where killing criminals is essentially necessary, like in the case when they used military equipment in a robbery shootout in LA awhile back. But then other circumstances would come up, grayer areas.']"
"[""There is a AI robot with a significant role at the United Nationâ€™s that appears to have all the indications, even her name, which is corresponding to a specific end times bible prophecy about the image of the beast which would speak. Wikipedia articles and news reports help demonstrate. This was also allowed to be posted on the United Nation's subreddit. [https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/krw759/ai\\_robot\\_with\\_role\\_at\\_united\\_nations\\_could\\_be\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/krw759/ai_robot_with_role_at_united_nations_could_be_the/)"", 'I don\'t think it would necessarily need to be a ""kill all humans"" approach on the part of the robots. It all really depends why the machines were created, for what purpose, by whom, and whether they have achieved any level of true sentience.  Were the machines created to be a governmental system? Were they for efficiently managing businesses and supply chains? Were they created for some other purpose? Were they created to be independent, sentient, living things and had some motivation or another to pursue world domination? Do the machines feel superior to us? Do they feel subjugated by us? Do they feel anything at all? Are the machines strictly judged by programming, or is there something else motivating their actions? Are the machines flawed by design? Can these machines feel greed, or any need at all? Do the machines want to survive? Do the machines have will? (sentient AI is so ripe for existential topics).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would think that the robots would run society in a cold and efficient manner, with every aspect of our daily routine, what we learn, the people we communicate with, and life trajectory being calculated well in advance. It could be safe and cosy, you don\'t have a lot to worry about, your needs are met, you hardly have to even think at all. A lot of people might prefer this life, long to be part of it, some might even be zealously devoted to maintaining the machine\'s order.\n\nWe are simply productive units, doing the things that machines either can\'t do, are not good at doing, or things that would be less resource intensive to have a human do.  The human brain is vastly complex, the human body is flexible, manoeuvrable, and adaptive, and they can both be created easily with a sufficient input of water and nutrients; even if machines far outclassed us in physical capability and intellect, we might still be barely worth managing as a resource.\n\nThere would be a lot of possible utility for having humans around.  Maybe a lot of us would live our lives processing the equivalent of Capcha images for the purpose of informing a complex machine-learning algorithm, we can more easily fit into nooks and crannies when required in an industrial setting; what if the machines lack some of our creative problem solving capabilities and need to produce mass quantities of us, and educate us, to guarantee an output of high-quality thinkers? It could just be that one or more of our organic components is valuable in some industrial process, and our sole purpose in life is to supply that.\n\nHuman happiness and mental health are not much more than a collection of variables in the machine\'s algorithmic productivity formula; if depression, for example, affected one\'s productivity, the machine amalgamation launches a scripted response, adjusting their diet and medication, inserting rest and recreation into their schedule, and exposing them to stimuli which has been extensively tested and refined to produce feelings of satisfaction, and motivation. This isn\'t out of care for the human being, just the results of a calculation which could have resulted in an end-of-life decision if you fell below a value threshold, which would have you deemed unsalvagable before being sent for liquidation.\n\nThe part that gets really super dystopian is considering how a mechanical government would handle defence, security, a penal system, healthcare, and other critical roles involving matters of life, death, and freedom. Maybe a robot would be truly impartial on these matters, and whether that is a ""good"" thing is irrelevant.']"
"[""Property ownership would be mandatory. Every adult would be given a solar powered house with a small plot of land maybe 1-2 acres in size in what would be known as the Super-Suburb. Super-Suburb Grids would be placed in fertile river drainage basins and other places with arable land and relatively uniform geography. Living in cities or in fully rural areas would be banned. \n\nThere would be 3 zones, the Nature Zone, the Super-Suburb or Residential Zone, and the City Zone or Work Zone. \n\nThe Nature Zone would be public wilderness land where no one would live. People could still camp here for long periods of time. \n\nPeople would all live in the residential zone where a plot would be reserved for every individual. Here everyone would have an agricultural plot where food would be grown including an aquatic farm, an insect farm, and maybe some chickens and goats in addition to a subsistence garden. All electricity would come from rooftop solar panels that would also supply electricty to an electric car. A vast gridwork of roads would lead from the Super-Suburb plots to regularly spaced maglev train stations that would take commuters to the cities to work.\n\nThe City Zone or Work Zone would be uninhabited by humans, it would be exclusively relegated to work and other visits. It would be the business and government hub of the civilization. Robots would be made here and manufacture what was needed here. \n\nAll housing plots would be designed to be more or less equal. People couldn't buy or sell them, although they could trade them. Inheritance would be illegal, when someone died their house plot would go back into the system. Couples could trade their individual units for dual units and families could move to a 4 person unit, leaving their old property behind for others. Having more than 2 children would be illegal without a permit so there would be zero population growth. There would be a cultural motivation to limit children to two to limit the need for government enforcement. This means that couples and families could reasonably expect to get a larger property unit. There would be a few extra vacant housing units for emergencies. \n\nRobots that were not self aware would maintain the microfarms and houses. These robots would also build new houses if the wear and tear got to be too much. Robots alone might not be able to handle all of the construction so human construction workers would assist. \n\nThe basic idea would be that everyone would have all food, water, shelter, and of course air needs met. Healthcare and public education would be guaranteed to everyone as well. People would still work in cities to help build, maintain, program, and operate robots. They would also do other work as well like manufacturing more solar panels, genetically engineering crops to make microfarming more efficient, road work, clothing manufacturing, raw materials processing, healthcare, engineering, science, etc. Basically, people would work at what jobs they wanted for recreational money because all of their needs would be provided for by their assigned microfarms. It is possible that some choice would be involved in getting a house, but it would probably have to be first come, first served basis. The economics would be a free market, but the necessary amount of taxes would go to maintaining the Super-Suburb system if people didn't volunteer enough to do this. People could use their excess money from work to build nicer houses on their plots, but there could never be more than 2-3 acres of land ownership per person. \n\nThere would also some government operartions. Democracy would be largely direct with most decisions being voted on online by everyone and new proposals being submitted by everyone. AI programs would ensure constitutional rights were upheld with each law passed, but even this would have human oversight so constitutional amendments could happen.\n\nEvery adult would be required to be a member of the Civic Justice Force after completing an associate program in criminal justice as part of public education. They would patrol Super-Suburbs on an occasional cyclical basis, so there would be no police force although they would have superiors they would answer to. They would do volunteer work like fire fighting and getting sick or injured people to hospitals, which would be equally spaced throughout the Super-Suburb Grid.\n\nA wise sounding person I can't remember once said, if you want to come up with a dystopia try to imagine a utopia and then try to figure out how you would get there...  Is this a dystopia?""]"
