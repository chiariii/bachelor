Do Not Trust Robots
OC - a girl and her robot by me 2018. with an inktober background!
"Mr. Robot is Incredible.I only heard of this show recently because of some sort of NMS drama going on involving hacks. Don't care for that, but *this show* man.

It has the delicious synth music, the lone introvert hacker trying to subvert an immense power structure while battling depression and loneliness in an uncaring, increasing technological world, recent world events and history blending together creating a story that is as believable as can be despite technically being fiction...

I can't believe I didn't know about this show earlier. Completely flew under my radar."
"COVID-19, police and robots[This article](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/smart-cities-news/robots-can-deliver-smart-policing-in-the-post-covid-19-reality) describes the somewhat recent trend in smart policing, i.e. the use of robots in police forces. The author is clearly in favor of an increase of this trend, and is probably aware of some common cyberpunk tropes that everyone has heard about a robot-dominated world: ''The use of robots in cities should come with trust-building messages in  the media to dispel concerns that a dystopian future looms.'' The most notable examples are in Singapore.

I think the most cyberpunk thing in this article is the mix between:

a)  The belief that police forces are necessarily a good thing for a community (but what should we expect from a Research Fellow with the Centre of Excellence for National Security?);

and

b) The belief that integrating 'smart' technology into police forces can only increase their beneficial effect. 

The author thinks the pandemic has put extra pressure on organizations to use other ways to enforce social distancing, and I think he's right. However, this 'robotization' would've happened at some point, since the trend has been to put extra money in police gear and gadgets, transforming a police force that sometimes look more like a proto-Robocop than anything else."

Happy New Years r/Cyberpunk!
This is gonna end well...
"[Short story, series] Mecha SaviorEric Thompson scanned over his three computer screens, displaying the high-level dashboard for Unlimited Partners. He smiled as he contemplated the sea of green, with only a few scattered yellow areas. Near him hovered an executive intern, assigned for the day to trail Eric and learn what his job was like.

""So as you can see,"" Eric began, ""our madly daring idea is actually bearing fruit! Overall success depends on team-building; that's one of my specialties. But then the people I choose have to carry *that* on to the teams they build, and so on. All of these levels have to work, or the entire project could easily fail with speed."" He turned to look at the intern. ""There's no magic formula for accomplishing that; you have to be well-learned and thoughtful, you have to make your best judgment, then observe their results and see what needs to be changed, without succumbing to micromanagement. All I can say about my method is, I try to hire good people and then get out of their way. So far, it's working for me.""

""Very inspirational, sir,"" the intern chimed. ""I hope to contribute to that as much as possible. I believe this company has a bright future!""

Without warning, a red rectangle pushed its way onto his dashboard. Eric chuckled to himself. ""Right on time."" He clicked the high-priority emergency notification and began reading. Within moments, his eyes glazed over and his jaw dropped. The intern began to shiver uncontrollably. Blinking rapidly, Eric pondered who in the organization could handle this crisis.

His phone rang. He picked it up quickly; he didn't need to see who it was.

""What can you tell me about the intruder?"" Eric said anxiously.

""It's heading for downtown Milleniaburg!"" his security chief replied breathlessly. ""An old-school jet airliner hijacking. They had no trouble slipping through the porous security of what's left of the government forces.""

""Not a big surprise,"" Eric lamented. ""But why are they attacking *us*? What's their motivation?""

""Information is still patchy,"" the chief related. ""But the hijackers claim to be people we banished.""

""Then what's the point of attacking us?"" Eric pondered. ""It's not like they want to return; there's nothing for them here, unless they clean up their act. Which they clearly haven't done.""

""I don't think they're acting entirely rationally, sir,"" the chief offered. ""We have to treat this as an existential threat, not as something we can fix.""

""But what are our options?"" Eric pleaded. But he knew the answer.

""We only have one, sir,"" the chief replied sanguinely. ""We have to shoot it down.""

""But that would be a disaster!"" Eric objected. ""Our credibility is based on demonstrating a better way to run things. If we just kill them indiscriminately, it'll set our cause back, possibly permanently!""

Eric could hear the sorrow in the chief's voice. ""They'll be in downtown Milleniaburg in thirty minutes. I don't think we have a choice.""

Eric's eyes glowed with sudden revelation. ""I think we might."" His skin flushed red as he took a deep breath. ""OK, you prepare to shoot them down, but don't fire until they're seconds from impact! I'm going to try something.""

""Like *what*?"" the chief pleaded. But Eric had already hung up.

At a workbench, deep within the 16otaku complex, Stacy pondered the red robotic gladiator. ""OK, buddy,"" she chirped, ""show me what you got!""

In a single fluid motion, it flipped onto its back, extended its legs, and popped open its main access panel. Stacy scratched at the empty air above it. ""You want a belly rub? Who wants a *belly rub*?"" she cooed.

""Oh, come on,"" Irwin chided, as the blue robot gladiator did the same thing for him. ""They're only *partially* sentient.""

""You keep saying that,"" Stacy countered, ""but these two keep doing things we don't understand. That's why we're having this examination, remember?""

Irwin shook his head. ""Big Daddy is adamant that it's nothing he's changed. So it has to be a crossed wire, or some undetected damage, somewhere. I'm not buying your theories.""

Stacy removed the outer circuit board and gently laid it on the bench. ""After everything you've seen them do, how can you really believe that?"" She gaped at what she saw. ""*What* the—""

""What...?"" Irwin replied tersely as he finished removing the blue bot's outer circuit board, revealing what was inside. ""Oh...oh my...""

Nothing they were looking at was familiar. There wasn't an inner circuit board; it appeared to be a tightly-constructed melange of custom parts, the function of which they could only guess at. Even the shapes of the components were novel. Were they capacitors? Transistors? Semiconductors? Functions seemed to blur together in a kaleidoscope of odd shapes, running over and under other parts to form a complex, yet strangely regular pattern. Clear tubes intertwined with mechanical parts, conducting neural tissue throughout the volume.

""*We* didn't build this!"" Stacy gasped. ""*They* must have built it themselves!""

""But what does it do?"" Irwin pondered. ""I mean, obviously they're running themselves with this, but why this arrangement? It doesn't...oh, wait. Maybe it does.""

""What?"" Stacy watched Irwin walk over to her bench and look inside the red droid.

""I think I get it,"" he postulated. ""Step back and look at the arrangement as a whole, not as parts. What does it look like?""

""Kind of like..."" Stacy's brow furrowed. ""I don't know, a sponge?"" Suddenly her eyes lit up. ""It's a big shock absorber!""

""Exactly!"" Irwin trilled. ""We attach circuit boards with shock-absorbing mounts, but this takes it to another level!"" He pondered the intricate assembly for a moment. ""*Several* levels, actually. I've never seen *anything* like this.""

""Let's not sell it short,"" Stacy sniffed. ""We've never even *thought* of anything like this.""

Irwin continued to remove exterior panels on the blue bot. ""I think something like this would drive us mad before we got anywhere close to finishing. Plus, we'd need the design insights of a...a...""

""A supercomputer,"" Stacy finished. ""A really big one. Like what all the bots form at night, when they're left alone. Remember, we're only here eight hours a day; they spend a lot of time by themselves. Looking into everything they get up to when we're away would be its own full-time job. Well, several, at least.""

""Wow, would you look at this?"" Irwin had finished removing exterior panels, as the blue bot continued to lie there supinely. ""Even the exoskeleton is different!""

Stacy leaned in to look. ""The beams are thinner, more numerous, and...very finely machined."" She pushed on one gently with her finger. ""It's metal, but it almost feels rubbery. They've strengthened it with...geometry?"" She lowered a magnifier lamp over it, and dialed up the power. ""Look at the intricate patterns running along the length! I'm not even sure what they do!""

Irwin shrugged. ""Well, we can stop *this* part of the investigation. We've answered our original question; now we know how their fighting skills have improved so much recently. We can do the rest from our desks, querying the database about these new designs and how they work."" He turned to the blue bot. ""So are you willing to tell us all about it?"" The blue bot responded by rotating its primary sensor array towards Irwin and mimicking a salute. Irwin laughed. ""I'll take that as a yes!"" He turned to Stacy. ""Now the *real* discovery begins!""

Stacy sighed. ""Just as soon as we finish putting them back together.""

They heard a noise behind them. The red bot, carrying its outer circuit board, had crawled up to them. It proffered two of its front legs upwards. ""Do you want a boost, little guy?"" Stacy cooed. She lifted him up and put him on the workbench. It crawled closer to the blue bot and gently tapped Irwin's hand twice. ""Oh, you have this under control?"" Irwin laughed. The red bot immediately grabbed an exterior panel and began reconnecting it to the blue bot. Irwin and Stacy both stepped back.

Stacy looked puzzled. ""How are they operating with their outer circuit boards disconnected?""

Irwin's expression became thoughtful. ""That does mostly diagnostic operations. We need it to see how they're doing, but apparently *they* don't. I guess they have other methods!""

Stacy frowned. ""And somehow, this all escaped the notice of Big Daddy?""

Irwin shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't ask the right questions. But now *we* have a chance to!"" Irwin's eyes shone with wonder. ""This is bound to be a mind-blowing experience!""

Stacy looked beatific. ""Just one more thing I can't wait to learn about!""

Irwin smiled. ""Do you feel like a proud parent as much as I do?""

Stacy giggled. ""Yes! Our babies are growing up.""

Suddenly, Sam burst into the room. Stacy turned to him, smiling broadly. ""Wait until you hear what *we've* learned!""

""Never mind that!"" Sam shouted. Stacy and Irwin both froze. Sam tried to catch his breath. ""We have a *much* more pressing matter! I need you two at the cubicles, *now*!"" He ran off. Stacy and Irwin exchanged worried glances, then ran after him.

They arrived to find a video conference with Eric Thompson, already in progress. ""So you see what we're up against? We don't have any good options. Your work, in its present condition, is our only hope!""

Stacy tapped Dwight on the shoulder. ""What is he talking about?""

Dwight's eyes seemed to be filled with a sepulchral darkness. ""A jet airliner has been hijacked, and is headed our way. Eric wants us to try to stop it with a mecha.""

Stacy froze. ""Seriously?""

""All I want to know,"" Eric pleaded, ""is if there's a *chance*!""

""The rocket limbs have had a few controlled burns,"" Gary explained. ""They all worked as expected. But we haven't actually tried to fly it yet.""

Eric smiled. ""Well, today's the day! Are you up for it?""

""We've never even taken it *outside*!"" Isabel protested. ""In *theory*, it should work. All our tests have come back positive. But it's never been tried in the field!""

Eric wrung his hands. ""I'm sorry to ask this of you, but our backs are really up against the wall!"" He looked more unnerved than any of them had seen before. ""And I'm not going to sugarcoat this; you'll all be risking your lives. But a lot more lives hang in the balance, not to mention the success of our entire company! This is our make-or-break moment!"" He hung his head. ""I can't ask you to take this chance. You have to *choose* to.""

No one spoke. Then Dwight piped up. ""Some day I'll be an old man in a rocking chair on a porch, and I'll look back at this time...and if I don't act now, that old man is going to regret it and kick himself.""

""Yeah!"" Stacy exhorted. ""Let's *do* this!""

Sam could hardly contain himself. ""Then...I've always wanted to say this...*mecha pilots, assemble*!""

Gary, Dwight, Stacy, and Irwin, cheering loudly, ran for the hangar, the others close behind.

Eric turned his head; the camera followed to watch them leave. ""God speed, my brain-trust warriors.""

""How much fuel do we have on board?"" Gary asked breathlessly.

""Five hundred and twenty pounds,"" Dwight replied, gasping for air. ""We haven't refueled since our last burn.""

""No time now! What's our battery charge?""

""They should be full,"" Isabel answered. ""I left it plugged in.""

They arrived in the hangar. The four pilots ran off to their respective flight decks. The rest attended to the remote monitoring and diagnostic stations. ""Big Daddy!"" Sam shouted into the microphone. ""We're taking out the flying mecha. Are all systems go?""

""I heard about the hijacking, and the plan,"" Big Daddy answered in his usual sedate manner. ""All systems are go. My confidence is high. I just wish there was time to add fuel.""

Isabel threw a knife switch to raise the hangar door, as the various parts of the mecha powered on. ""Oh, heck,"" she said suddenly, as she ran towards the mecha, which was flexing its joints, doing its final tests. ""It's still plugged in!"" she yelled. ""I need a minute!""

Gary's voice squelched over the radio link. ""Uh...Sam? How do we get this thing outside? It's too tall for the hangar door.""

Sam stared blankly. ""Um...not sure. We've never tried it before.""

Isabel finished yanking out the assortment of extension cords, then high-tailed it back to her workstation.

Stacy's voice piped up. ""I think we have to crawl.""

The mecha lowered itself to the ground, and clumsily put its hands on the ground. After a few false starts, it began crawling towards the hangar door, its pace quickening as the crew got the hang of it. ""You know what they say,"" Dwight quipped. ""You have to crawl before you can fly.""

They reached the taxiway outside the hangar; unfamiliar sunlight poured into the mecha's sensors. Quickly, it adjusted to the new inputs, and gave its pilots a clear picture of their surroundings. Their mission computers all bleeped; the intercom link surged with Sam's voice. ""OK, I've linked you to the radar tracking of the bogey. We've got ten minutes until it reaches the outskirts of the city, and fifteen minutes until it reaches Unlimited Partners central HQ.""

Gary pondered the trajectory as Dwight fired the rocket limbs, preparing them for flight. ""We should be able to intercept it at the city's edge...but we're going to have to use our full thrust. This is going to be *really* rough. Are you all willing?""

All pilots answered affirmatively. ""Then off we go!"" Gary cheered as he slid all four thrust-power sliders to their maximum. The mecha shuddered uncertainly, slowly lifting off the ground, then wavered a little bit. As all four limbs pointed themselves down, in the same direction, suddenly it began picking up speed. It took off into the morning sky, piercing through the morning fog and vanishing.

""Aaaaah! I can't do this!"" Irwin yelled. ""I feel like I'm being crushed!""

""One moment!"" Gary yelled. ""OK, your suit should be extra pressurized now. Any better?""

""This really hurts!"" Irwin continued to scream.

""Keep screaming!"" Stacy yelled. ""It'll help keep you from blacking out!""

""She's right!"" Dwight interjected. ""Scream, tense up all your muscles, and hold in your stomach! We'll have to deal with maximum G forces until we get there!""

Irwin continued to scream; Gary turned down the volume on his intercom. ""As long as we can still hear him, it means he's OK. Some prior training for G forces would have been really helpful, but it's too late now.""

""Is this right?"" Stacy interrupted. ""Only seven minutes to intercept?""

""Sure looks like it,"" Gary agreed. ""The rocket-limbs are working really well. We're burning an awful lot of fuel, though. It'll take four hundred pounds just to reach the intercept point. I just hope Irwin can take it. Irwin, you hanging in there?""

""Aaaaaaaaaugh!"" Irwin continued to scream. ""I love iiiiiiiit! There's nothing else I'd rather doooooooo!""

Dwight was unconvinced. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""As long as he's still screaming, he's alive,"" Gary joked.

""He's fine,"" Isabel radioed. ""His vital signs are all good. Keep doing what you're doing, Irwin!""

""Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" he continued to yell.

""Can you imagine what they must be thinking on the ground?"" Stacy wondered.

""The anime fans are probably having a religious experience,"" Gary offered. ""Assuming they can see us.""

""That brings up an important issue,"" Dwight pointed out. ""What happens when the *hijackers* see us?""

""That depends,"" Gary offered. ""Are they going to be looking for a giant flying robot?""

""Uh...hmmm...good point. We'll have to hope we surprise them.""

The mecha continued to fly across the sky, angling upwards, its rocket-limbs spewing white-hot flames twice as long as its body. The mission computers had calculated that, given their current trajectory, that at the intercept point, they'd be five hundred feet above the airliner. ""I believe we can drop on them from above,"" Gary suggested. ""I think that's our best plan.""

""It's getting hot in here,"" Stacy observed. ""How's our cooling system?""

""Not yet running at full,"" Gary answered. ""I can turn them up. We should have sufficient battery power. Isabel?""

""You sure do,"" Isabel assured. ""You were charged to the top when you left.""

""I think I'm finally getting the hang of this,"" Irwin suddenly added, sounding strained.

""Glad to hear it, buddy!"" Gary chimed. ""I'm going to need your fine motor skills when we move to intercept. You ready for this?""

""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" Irwin gushed.

""Just keep up your G-force countermeasures,"" Isabel reminded. ""You're doing good, but don't relax them.""

""Not a problem,"" Irwin assured. ""They've become second nature.""

The rockets dropped their power slightly; the flight computers had adjusted the autopilot for the intercept. Gliding over the river that formed the northern border of the city, the mecha started to rotate in the air. Gary's voice filled the intercom. ""Hold on to your stomachs, people. This is going to feel really weird. Try not to get airsick.""

The mecha pivoted in the air, and pointed its limbs down, allowing it to hover. It came to a stop.

""The airliner is thirty seconds away, and we're seven hundred feet above it,"" Gary announced.

""And they don't *see* us?"" Stacy sounded incredulous. ""Not even on radar?""

""I'm not picking up any radar from them,"" Dwight observed. ""They must be operating on visual flight rules. Not a surprise if they're amateurs. They're probably just fixated on their target. Fortunately for us.""

The aircraft finally became visible on their external cameras. ""I'm ready for the intercept thrust,"" Gary announced. ""Irwin, you ready to grapple?""

""I was *born* to do this!"" Irwin exulted.

Gary counted down. ""Six...five...four...three...two...one...BURN!""

The mecha's limbs flung themselves back, and its rockets fired. The external cameras showed the plane approach; a few seconds before impact, its limbs swung down again, to slow its descent. With a loud, resounding crunch, the mecha impacted with the airliner. Quickly, its arms dove under the wings, and its hands met on the plane's roof, near the first-class section, putting the plane into a full nelson. Its feet pushed backwards, finding their grip on each side of the tail wing. A few tense moments passed.

""We're not stopping them!"" Gary shouted frantically. ""They've turned up their engines, and we don't have the fuel to use ours to slow them down!""

There was a few moments of silence. ""Can we kick our legs, like we're on a swing?"" Stacy suggested. ""If we can point the airliner upward, maybe we can get control of it.""

Gary sounded unsure. ""Irwin? Do the arms have a good grip?""

Irwin sounded confident. ""They're not going *anywhere*. Start kicking!""

The mecha's feet pulled themselves from the tail wings and began bucking wildly. Slowly, the airliner began to pitch upwards.

""I wonder what *this* looks like on the ground,"" Stacy asked sardonically.

Sam's voice, over the radio, feigned embarrassment. ""Um, well, when an airplane and a giant robot love each other *very* much...""

""It's working!"" Irwin suddenly exclaimed. ""Stop kicking! The airplane is in an aerodynamic stall. Its engines aren't enough to keep it in the air. Just a little bit of thrust from our legs, and we should be able to bring this unholy union to the ground!""

The mecha and airplane, locked in their hostile embrace, continued to plummet downwards.

""Why do you think the airliner hasn't cut its engines?"" Dwight asked. ""That would make our job a lot more difficult.""

""Maybe they didn't think of it,"" Gary suggested. ""We jolted them pretty hard when we hit; maybe they're unconscious.""

""Or maybe they're just panicking,"" Stacy wryly observed.

""Let's just hope our luck doesn't run out!"" Gary added. ""I think I can guide us to that empty field near the interstate. I'll try to slow down before we hit, but I can't guarantee anything. We're getting dangerously low on fuel. Brace for impact!""

On the ground, traffic on the interstate had come to a halt. People had left their cars to gawk at the garishly-colored spectacle plummeting towards them. As the airliner's jet engines continued to strain against its captor, the mecha fired its rockets in a finely-coordinated pattern, trying to steer them to the grassy plain, one of the few areas nearby that wasn't either trees or buildings. A few moments before reaching the ground, the mecha's leg-rockets suddenly flared brightly, slowing their descent and starting a few small brush fires. With a surprisingly gentle crushing noise, the airliner landed on the ground, the mecha still firmly attached to its top.

They continued to slide along the ground. ""Their engines are still firing! If we don't stop them, they'll drag us both into the river!""

""How about if I pinch their engines?"" Irwin offered. ""I'll have to let go with the arms, but I should be able to do this.""

""I think that's our best bet,"" Gary agreed. ""Do it!""

The mecha's arms let go. Quickly, it slid down the length of the airliner, but suddenly, the legs grappled the aircraft's sides, stopping its motion. Now in position, the arms reached towards the engines and crushed them with its hands. Jet fuel sprayed from the wounded turbines as the airliner and its giant passenger slid along the ground for several hundred more feet, finally coming to a stop.

The external microphones picked up a buzzing sound, growing louder. ""Where did the drones come from?"" Stacy asked. ""The highway?""

""That's it!"" Gary suddenly interjected. ""Irwin, rip the roof off of the flight deck! Let the drones take care of the hijackers!""

""You got it!"" The mecha shimmied up the length of the airliner; when it got near the front, its giant hands dug its fingers under the sides, peeling the roof back like a giant sardine can. Four hijackers stood in the exposed flight deck, gaping upwards in sheer terror. Quickly, the drones swarmed them; a few precisely-fired taser bolts later, and they all collapsed to the ground.

""YOU DID IT!"" a voice on the radio yelled. More cheering could be heard in the background. Stacy reacted with surprise. ""Wait, was that Eric Thompson?""

""It's me, and everyone else at headquarters!"" Eric answered. ""Plus several million more viewers on TV.""

""Wow,"" Stacy stammered. ""Way to bury the lede there, boss.""

""Are you kidding?"" Eric gushed. ""We wouldn't have missed this for the world!""

""Uh..."" Irwin began. ""Glad to be of service?""

The external microphones now picked up the cheers of the passengers. The emergency doors had opened, the exit chutes had inflated, and passengers were sliding out of the stricken aircraft as quickly as they could. Most of them gawked at the giant robot, which continued to sit astride the airplane, like a brightly-colored cowboy on a white horse. A few had run off, to stamp out the small brush fires caused by the mecha's rockets.

The external cameras showed the highway, the passengers having left their cars en masse. All were cheering and clapping.

""Did we actually live through that?"" Irwin's voice gasped weakly. ""The adrenaline is wearing off. I think I'm going to lose it.""

""Permission to lose it granted,"" Sam jokingly intoned. ""You've all done a great job.""

""You know what would be awesome?"" Dwight piped up. ""We should fly away from here, back to base, and salute in the air for everyone on the highway.""

""Not going to happen,"" Isabel related over the radio. ""You only have thirty pounds of fuel left.""

""Can we siphon anything from the airliner?"" Stacy asked.

Isabel paused for a moment. ""You don't have anything to siphon with,"" she sighed. ""We never thought to add such an attachment.""

""Then what do we do?"" Dwight pined. ""We can't just lay here and wait for a big flatbed to pick us up. That'd be embarrassing!""

""There's a truck stop about two miles down the highway,"" Sam offered. ""Diesel fuel is close enough to aircraft fuel for the mecha's systems. And between your remaining battery power, and the internal generators, you have enough power to..."" Sam paused for a moment. ""To walk there.""

""Well, I guess that'll still look pretty cool,"" Dwight agreed reluctantly. ""But not what I was hoping for.""

Gary's voice crackled over the mecha's loudspeakers. ""Citizens, please give me some space. I need to leave."" The passengers obediently formed a wide circle around the mecha. Slowly, it moved to stand up and dismount the airliner, to the cheers of everyone nearby. Unsteadily, the mecha walked towards the highway; the circle of people parted to let them through.

""Blast off! Blast off!"" the kids yelled, picked up by the external microphones. ""See, I knew they'd want that,"" Dwight sighed. ""We need to plan better in the future.""

Gary's voice once again blared from the loudspeaker. ""Sorry, kids. Not enough fuel. But maybe next time!"" All four pilots could hear their disappointed whines. Gary continued. ""Hey, c'mon, kids! I'm still a giant flying robot!"" The kids quickly began cheering again. The mecha slowly, clumsily walked away.

""OK, I think our autopilot can handle this,"" Gary declared. ""Just watch for sinkholes or loose soil.""

As they neared the highway, the disembarked passengers continued to cheer and clap. The mecha stopped and stood there. The loudspeaker crackled once again with Gary's voice. ""Citizens, please move your vehicles. I have to get home."" They finally stopped cheering, went back into their cars, and got out of the way. The mecha crawled up the embankment, walked across the lanes of traffic, and began trudging down the highway in the slow lane. Cars slowly drove past it, horns honking and passengers whooping, before driving off. The mecha occasionally saluted, to even louder cheers.

The customers at the truck stop could hear the rhythmic clanking noise from quite some distance away. As the mecha approached, most of them just stood and stared, their mouths gaping. The mecha walked into the parking lot, picked a row of interior pumps, and stood there, waiting. The loudspeaker flared again. ""Don't mind me, citizens. I just need fuel. I'll wait in line.""

The two truckers that were next in line made several animated arm gestures, then each got into their trucks, started them up, and moved to back up. The mecha backed up too, getting out of their way. Deftly, the trucks slithered past each side of the mecha, smoothly arriving back in their lanes. ""Thank you, citizens!"" the loudspeaker blared.

Slowly, the mecha lowered itself onto its hands and knees. From there, it shifted to a prone position, and began to army-crawl between the rows of gas pumps. The clanking and scraping made a ferocious noise that caused many onlookers to cover their ears. Finally, the mecha was in position, and the steady hum of its power shut down, leaving behind a ghostly silence.

A few moments passed. Then the sides of each limb opened up, and the pilots exited, lowering themselves gingerly to the ground. As the onlookers continued to gawk, the pilots nonchalantly pulled out their company credit cards, swiped them at the pumps, then each removed a gas cap and put the diesel spouts into the exposed fuel filler.

The trucker opposite Dwight stammered. ""Uh...er...um...what kind of mileage do you get in that thing?""

""I'm not sure,"" Dwight answered. ""We just burned about five hundred pounds; that got us a total of about fifteen miles. We used a lot less fuel during free-fall, though.""

""Free-fall?"" the trucker replied weakly. ""Buddy, you must have horseshoes in *both* pockets.""

A few families had crowded around Irwin. ""How do you become a giant-robot pilot?"" one kid asked.

""First, you have to invent it,"" Irwin answered. ""I'm part of the team that built this. We have two more back at our lab.""

""Do they fly too?"" The kid's eyes burned with adoration.

""Not yet, but after today, I'm sure we'll add it soon!"" The kid looked disappointed. Irwin continued. ""But...you know what they *can* do? Kung fu battle! Just like in the movies!"" The kid gaped wordlessly.

""What company do you work for?"" a man asked. ""Who is in the giant-robot business?""

""I'm with a research-and-development division of Unlimited Partners,"" Irwin answered. ""And we do a lot more than just giant robots.""

""Well, I'm sure glad you do!"" the man exulted. ""That was fine work, stopping that hijacking. Can you believe the government hasn't even released a statement on it? I think they're too humiliated.""

""I haven't had time to catch up on the news,"" Irwin explained. ""I'm sure I will...once I fly back to the office.""

""That's right, ladies — you *too* can become a giant-robot pilot!"" Stacy happily explained to a throng of Girl Scouts, hanging on her every word. ""And I don't just fly it; I helped *design* and *build* it! But you'll need to stay in school, study hard, and keep out of trouble! Jobs like these only go to the best! And *you* can make it this far, if you just apply yourselves!""

""We will!"" they cheered as they ran off to get back in their vans.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that,"" the den mother told Stacy.

""No problem, I get it,"" Stacy answered. ""I know the Girl Scouts are for at-risk children. Hopefully they stay inspired.""

The den mother glanced at the mecha, her eyes filled with wonder. ""If *that* doesn't inspire them...*nothing* will.""

A thin, gangly man in business-casual left the shop and approached Gary, a stunned look on his face. Gary turned and smiled. ""Are you the manager?"" He tried to answer, but couldn't find his voice; finally, he just nodded vigorously.

""What's the pre-authorization limit on these pumps?"" Gary asked nonchalantly.

""Uh...ummm...seventy five gallons,"" the manager stammered.

""Can we all get authorized for about a thousand gallons each? We have a long flight home.""

""I...um...yes. I'll...go do...that."" The manager walked off, looking behind him one last time before disappearing inside the shop.

As the mecha continued to fuel, Dwight walked up to Stacy. ""So...before the next time...*rubber shoes*.""

Stacy laughed. ""I know, right? I though the *flight* was bad...the walk was easily *twice* as bad! I think my bones are still shaking.""

""And rubber knee pads and elbow pads, too.""

""Yeah...I'm not looking forward to fixing all those scrapes. But can you imagine it? The mecha will look like a roller-derby player! How awesome would *that* be?"" Stacy looked at the mecha, grinning impishly. ""How about retractable inline skates? The *heck* with all this walking!""

""Oh yeah, huh?"" Dwight agreed. ""I guess there are some ideas that don't occur to you unless you try the thing in the real world."" Dwight looked at the mecha's back. ""And why the heck don't we have a giant flaming sword?""

The four pilots continued to field questions, and receive congratulations, as the pumps slowly filled up the mecha. Finally, they put the spouts back, replaced the gas caps, and climbed back inside their respective flight decks, giving the crowds one last thumb's up before disappearing inside, to the din of their hails and cheers.

The mecha powered up, its electric hum making the air shake. This brought on another round of applause and whooping. It slowly army-crawled from under the canopy, back to unobstructed space. The metallic screeching and scraping sound silenced the crowd quickly as they covered their ears and winced.

""*Oh* my God,"" Irwin began. ""I haven't dealt with so much of the public in my *life*!""

""I heard *that*!"" Stacy added. ""This was fun once, but if there are any more public appearances, I think we need to use gregarious pilot types. I thought the *battle* was tough...having to deal with people was *much* more draining!""

""Hey Gary, once we're out, can we launch with only three of the rockets?"" Dwight asked. ""I really want to try a salute as we leave.""

""I think that'll be safe,"" Gary answered. ""But don't try anything fancy. Just one salute and we're done.""

""Not a problem,"" Dwight laughed. ""I'm willing to start small.""

The mecha walked to the far end of the complex's parking lot, away from the people, trucks, and anything flammable. After turning to face the crowd, its leg rockets ignited, along with one arm. As the mecha launched into the sky, its free arm moved to salute, before dropping that arm down and firing the last rocket. The exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but the rockets made too much noise to hear them.

The flight back to their airport was uneventful and leisurely. There was no need to use full rocket power; all the pilots had had enough of high G forces for one day.

The mecha neared the airport. The exterior cameras showed that huge crowds had formed on either side of the runway. The radio suddenly crackled to life. ""Welcome back, robo-nauts!"" Eric Thompson's voice gushed. ""You're all heroes!""

""Oh, man,"" Gary answered. ""I hope you don't expect us to deal with any more people. All we want to do is collapse."" The mecha moved to land upright.

""Not a problem,"" Eric assured them. ""You just need to land and crawl back inside. We'll deal with the press.""

""Thanks, boss,"" Gary replied, with great relief in his voice. ""The truck stop was agonizing, but we didn't know what else to do."" The mecha landed gently on the ground; the exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but they couldn't be heard over the roar of the rockets.

""I understand completely,"" Eric commiserated. ""And rest assured, you all get the rest of the day off. Well, after a full medical exam. We want to make sure you're intact.""

The mecha got down on its hands and knees. ""So do we,"" Gary agreed. ""We're just glad to have survived.""

""So am I,"" Eric answered sanguinely. ""And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about the reaction. Lots of nonpublic stuff. You all did more good today than you can possibly imagine.""

The mecha crawled through the hangar door. ""That's fine...but *tomorrow*. We need a break.""

""You've earned it,"" Eric agreed. ""Have a good evening.""

The hangar door closed behind the mecha, the loud clang reverberating across the runway."
"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"Stop me if you've heard this story pitch before...Humans willingly offer to rent their bodies like a timeshare to complex “rich” AIs which normally run corporate functions, so that the AIs may walk and enjoy the real world for a contracted amount of time and obey the agreed upon rules of what can and can’t be done while the AI is implanted in the body. AIs are considered living so are paid money, but robotics hasn’t advanced enough to recreate all of the senses desired. Afterwards, the human’s mind is restored, the AI departs, and the person is paid very well. These timeshare people take excellent care of their bodies and live fairly well.

Somewhere, a murder is committed, and a woman is found by the police at the crime scene holding the murder weapon, but she has no memory of it, claiming that the AI in control of her body did it. Only such claims have been made before by previous murderers. With nobody believing her, she escapes the police station to prove her innocence along with the help of a single detective who believes her, but he can only help from the shadows. The casework of the plot follows a trail based on who the murdered people were, discovering who the AI in control of the woman’s body was, leading to the discovery of a coup by an underground AI society to replace all of the human-minds in the city with their AI brothers, claiming that, “Since we are alive, don’t we have the right to feel!? To live and experience the world that we live in?” All the while though it is unsure who the AIs have already replaced, who is still human, making it nearly impossible to trust anybody."

* Entry #45

* 20:07

What a fucking drag of a day.

Five robot-related deaths in the past two weeks. People these days, trusting their robotic ""companions"" (nice word for a fucking slave) to cook their food, watch their kids and style their hair. This death was important though. The new owner of BluCore got shanked by his little butler. 

The kid just inherited the biggest corporation in the country, of course they sent us to clean up the mess. Can't be too mad though, if not for the kid's father, I'd be long gone. Too bad the old man couldn't save himself with all that tech he invested in. I'm not surprised, bastard was old when I was young. I kinda liked the guy.

The kid decided he's gonna live in a private island, good, makes it easy to hide this incident from the public eye. ""The owner of the biggest manufacturer of robotics and augmentation got killed by his own product"", one headline like that and it's the bottom of the stock market for BluCore. Too bad he also decided to have the best security money can buy. Took 3 hours for Brad to work his magic and god forbid we blow a few holes and make a forced entry. See, sensitive data could get damaged. Watch HQ take this bastard's death and find a way to make a profit. Couldn't give less of a shit.

We move in. Top floors are clear, we make our way down the elevator shaft. Pop the doors open and here's the scenery of the century. Kid's lying in a blood pool, robot's standing there with a butter knife, looking at him with a dead expression, repeating standard lines ""how was your day, sir?"", ""how are you doing, sir?"", ""how was work today, sir?"" Some fucking nightmare fuel right there.

We disable the robot. Would have been fun to rip its head off, but our murderous friend was part of the ""sensitive data"". When we secured the place, clean-up crew and engineers moved in ant took over. Apparently the kid wasn't dumb, it's all need-to-know bases for us, but the engineers seemed surprised by whatever was in that lab.

 Gonna pay a visit to R&D crew tomorrow, the new augs been jamming up.

"[Synaptica] Cyberpunk Characters and World***Characters***


**David Freeman**

A hard boiled freelance detective for the Federal Bureau of Cyberneurics. David recalls Rustin Cohle, Joe Miller, Jimmy McNulty, Sherlock Holmes with a shot of Christian Bale on the rocks.

David is a caucasian male in his late forties, approximately six feet two inches. Some long line of introspective European, maybe German or Jewish. He is medium built with coiled muscles and razer reflexes from prior military training and cardiovascular exercise. He has a gaunt angled face framed with stiff black hair just beginning to edge grey. His nose, bent from too many bar fights, watches over chapped and sealed lips. His eyes are hollow almond, the kind that wish they were somewhere else. He wears a prussian blue work suit which hasn’t been ironed in a while and a coffee-stained dress shirt.

Loss drives David, loss of his daughter. He spends his days remorsing on her death and his nights searching for her killer. All the while drowning in the closest drink. After his daughter’s death David had her neural network digitally entombed, the demi-soul of her thoughts now dwelling on a cerebral implant inside his head. He wants his daughter back but knows he can never have that. He harbors burning vengeance for the one who took his daughter away for him but six long years of searching have brought him no closer. His is a relentless pursuit of truth.

David is a rowboat of self-inflicted rage amid a tempest of sorrow. David keeps mostly to himself and has trouble trusting the intentions of others. Experienced at sensing the order of things, David focuses on objective facts and patterns to solve crimes. Everything is processed through logical filters and his curiosity is often more interested in finding answers then the answers themselves. Always vigilant, David adapts to changing circumstances spontaneously. His voice is monologue and melancholy, the kind talking directly to you. His vocabulary, down to earth and working man but all to often straying toward existentialism. 

David is a heterosexual man. His ex-wife used to break out the kinky handcuffs, but that was before she left, taking his chance of a happy little family with her. And the dog, he liked the dog. It is not that David won’t stop and momentarily contemplate the taunt wet curves of the stripper at the bar. But it always comes back to the pointlessness of it all which prevents him from forming human connections.

Politically, David supports the Hegemony because the Hegemony supports his paycheck. He knows the government does bad things but, the way he sees it, it is not his problem. Whether it is this party in power or that one makes little difference. David holds much the same beliefs on religion. He is apatheistic, whether or not God exists being irrelevant since God clearly has no intention of interfering down here.

**Eli Achebe Malik**

A slave mechanic for the Keays War Raiders. Eli is constructed from Idris Elba, Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hardy, and nitro primed with Ludacris.

Eli is an african american male in his mid thirties, approximately six feet seven inches. Before the Fall, genetic engineering was widespread and in the post-apocalyptic nomads these mutagen chromosomes have been evolutionarily selected. His bones are ultra-dense from rare earth metal ossification. Myosacro hyperplasia reinforced by years of junkyard weight lifting have built his muscles brutish. Eli’s face has a rough texture and granite jawline, his hair is corded dreadlocks adorned with cerimonial trinkets. His skin is scarred ebony hide. His hawk eyes are shaded moss green. His left arm is a military-grade cybernetic aug with hydraulic servos and piezoelectric twitch fibers. He wears a threaded dirt linen tunic with camouflage leather breeches. When traveling in the mantle tunnels he wears a mole suit, water cooled trench coat and strapped oxygen tank. He speaks rarely but when he does his voice is calm and bass. His vocabulary is english mixed with Akkadian.

Survival drives El, survival at any conceivable cost. Taken from his birth clan as annual tribute, his first memories are of the long trek across the Oklahoma floodplains. He was sold at the outskirts of the Mojave irradiated zone to the Keays Boys. The savages brought him to the trash mesa ruins of San Diego. They forced him into the mechanic trenches, but under the encouraging touch of thorn whips, Eli found he had a gift. He was adept at turning rusting metal into diesel-spitting machine. His cars, whether screaming past salt-flat speedways or pillaging neighboring tribes, always seemed the fastest. On his name day he was sold to the Boss for work on the warlord’s personal mech walker. He spends his days tinkering with gatling machine guns and squeezing every ounce of horsepower out of turbine engines. 

Eli is a calm wind over scorching desert. He has a serenity that comes from having everything taken away. He seeks a harmony with nature and shows a gentleness towards lingering life. But buried underneath that is loathing and fury for what his tormentors have done to him. He is independant save for the shackles that bind him, yet dependable, pragmatic and tenacious. In his mind what separates mankind from beast is values, chief among them honesty and justice and he judges others by this same code of honor. 

Eli is a heterosexual man. At an early age his genitals were mutilated both to boost testosterone for cage fights and render slaves unable to reproduce. David’s religion prohibits sexual desires outside of marriage and he is quick to temper errant thoughts. David, despite being a lone wolf, longs for a family some day.

Eli is an outsider. All he has ever known is gang tyranny and tribal castes. Eli believes deeply in the shamanistic creed of his birth, loosely translated as the Quake Brotherhood. This religion preaches that a prophet will come some day to reclaim the earth and only those who follow the rituals strictly will be saved. Eli has practiced these rituals in secret for many long years.


***Neo Angeles***


**The Towers**

Neo Angeles. Founded circa 2058 in the still cooling radioactive ash of old Los Angeles, the city was an amalgamation of constructed mountains and excativated canyons. On a clear day, from the outskirts of the Mojave Irradiated Zone you could just make out the Towers gleaming against the bay. Massive citadels formed from titan alloy skeleton and indomitable granicrete core, these mammoth institutes formed the foundation upon which humanity's future would be built or her soul finally crushed. There were seven towers. 

Lakshfi, Vault of Prosperity, home of the banking guilds and mega finance firms, was bedecked opulent golden whirls on decadent silver, her enormous clockface rang constantly trading marketplace cash, commodities and wealth from the Trans-African Republic to the Russian Confederacy. Anbal, High Seat of Justice, adorned marble columns with blind lady justice overwatching, in her halls the Judicators safeguarded the populace from unrelenting lawlessness. Seshrat, The Bureaucratic Monolith, tubule stylus where legions of unnamed bureaucrats churned the gears of society. Genaea, Birthplace of Gen-gineering, verdant helix whose spiraling terraces overflowed with designer vegetation and rejuvative stemcell tanks. Budyha, The Happy Corporation, supplier of franchised acme products worldwide, cartoon animations dancing along prismatic cubic surfaces. TyrX, NanoRobotic Industries, an ominous scarlet ziggurat, empty scarab husk abandoned since the Drone Wars.

The last Tower, Irez, rose above the rest. Her triangular heights crawling with vid screens and vox speakers. Pinnacle crowned satellite array broadcasting Pan-China syndicated programming. Irez was the nexus for the Neuro Electronic Terminus and it was said those working in the server bunkers underneath Irez could still feel the vibrational dreams of all those lost in the NET. 


**The Boxes**

The Boxes were the labyrinth sprawl at the foot of the Towers, a concrete jungle of condominiums squares and overlapping residential zones. Make enough credits and you live in a penthouse in the Highrizers. Don’t make enough and you sleep in an individual coffin bed slotted next to a couple hundred of your neighbors. For everyone in between there was the apartments. A billion people lived her, all struggling to find purpose among rampant commercialism, racial divides and a society become machine. 

The residential zones were checkered against the ever busy commercial sectors where your happiness was only a price tag away. Mega-malls, prefabricated chain stores and retail outlets reproducing at the limits of supply and demands. Here buzzing stream of delivery drones ferry online orders to the convenience of home. 

Interconnecting the residential zones and the commercial sectors was an expansive web of bridge, magnetic track and hoverway. The major transit hubs pumped the citizen lifeblood to the city through pneumonic hyperloops. Supersonic flights continuously taking off and landing at Asimove International. Perched on the hill overlooking the airfields was a lone X-21 Traveler, the launchpad on darkened lockdown since the moon colony went dark. Streams of fishing trawlers, cargo freighters, juvenile sportscraft and private yachts filtered through the cities two ports, North Marina and Rancid Harbor. 

At the northern end of the Boxes was Gates University, you did well in primary schooling, you went to Gates with a chance at a better life someday. Next door was the Neo Angeles Archival Library, buried in those dusty mainframes were stories from before the Fall and even the occasional banned religious texts. Nearby Genaea Memorial, High Cross and Children’s heals those with priority insurance. Those more indigent queue for St. Bellevue, coughing in the exhaust from the Infirm Crematoriums. 

The Boxes, for all it’s toil was not without its points of pleasure. In the Art district were the Grand Aero Theater, Bard Studioway, the Hover Speedway, and the Rave Circuses. The Entertainment Complex humed with upscale nightclubs, aroma restaurants, and the privilege casinos. Hybrid Gardens was home to reanimated birds and beasts from the extinct wild, now thriving in a photosynthetic jungle. Lakeshore Hills to the south offered serenity living for country club suburbanites. Vacation Island, pristine beach resort of the Elite, rested just offshore. And not to be forgotten was the theme park Budyha Land, family centric incorporated fun for all paying customers.


**The Industrial Pits**

Beneath the Boxes were kilometer deep bore holes penetrating the earth’s crust. Hollowed out shortly after the Twenty Minute War, they were originally intended to serve as massive fallout shelters for the city populace. However, they had since become dark fallen places where societies most undesirable seemed to settle. The poor, villainous and lost condemned to a subterranean life sentence. 

The Tech Caverns housed the massive nuclear facilities and hydroponics plants, life support for surface side. Augs, those who had chosen cybernetic enhancement for medical or cultural reasons were shunned by society but welcome in the engineering communities down here. The Indentured, civilians who sold their rights for protection, food and shelter, worked laborious and short lives in factory towns. Slugs, those addicted to drugs or virtual stimulation litered the sewer tunnels down here. Among these factory towns were the ethnic enclaves, Little India, Euroburg, Asiatown and Latinville, each with a dedicated crime family engaged in all out gang warfare amid ghetto squalor. 

Descend down a level and you would find the Subterrestrial Farms, growing luminescent biovats, gengineered plantations and meat slime nurseries. Harvesting drones nurtured and protected these pitch black fields from the hungry. The deepest abyssal Pits were mostly unknown. Hole 64 was a black site prison restricted to the most craven criminals and their machine wardens. Hole 51 was omega classified, some say it collapsed long ago, some say it contained pre-Fall relics. Those who said anymore, disappeared.

"Feedback on background story for my hacking simulation game*I'm working on a hacker simulation game (browser based mmo style), with a kind of cyberpunk'ish story. If you have the time, I would love to get some feedback on the little background story I wrote for the game :) Thank you in advance!*


The first version of the Burn software was born in year 2022. This were the end of the digital world as we knew it, for a long time...

Burn was a multi-platform malware worm, with the only purpose: To fry hardware parts in electronic devices, by modifying the internal circuits that handles the power to the attached hardware parts. And if that wasn’t possible on a specific device, the power stations were infected at the same time, to pass much more power through than normally.
In year 2022 most devices were effected. Everything from desktop computers, servers, phones, game consoles, hospital equipment, factory robots etc. All of these types of electronics were harmed in the heat of the Burn v1.0 attack.

The theory of how Burn spread so fast and aggressively, is that it used radio waves to spread the code. These radio waves could interfere with, and exploit the chips in computer controlled devices if sent on a specific secret frequency. And at the same time used the internet to go even further.
Nobody knows who wrote the Burn worm, but rumours say it could be the “TiNTE group”. A secret Chinese cyber-army division, known as “This is Not The End”, who worked on a new type of electronic weapon that they have lost control over. These rumours were only supported with the fact, that almost all of the remaining satellites in orbit, are made by the Chinese. And the few remaining operational datacentres is located in the Chinese region. Could this be a coincidence? Nobody knows.

In a world without a public internet, and where computers are scarce things that not everybody owns; corporations, criminals and hackers will always find a way to survive.
Either by exploiting the possibilities of the situation for their own good, or simply for the love of solving problems out of curiosity.

The internet is not completely dead… yet. People around the world, got access via the Chinese government to use the few satellites that are still online. That satellite system is named “2ndGenesis”, and is open for almost everyone. It’s neither stable nor fast, but definitely the best alternative to the internet we had before. To use the 2ndGenesis project, you need a username and password to login, a satellite based modem, and of course the most important thing: A working computer!

Computers now are more expensive than ever. But some people have old hardware pieces from before the Burn outbreak, and are capable of building their own machines.

4 years has passed since the worm attacked. The New Net has been taken over by anarchy, and criminal web-mafia like groups try to rule over the web, and are in constant war against each other.

You will take part as a newbie hacker, trying to get your own piece of The New Net, because there are a lot of money to be earned by selling soft- and hardware, industrial-espionage, R&D information and more... But you are not alone in cyberspace. Others might be looking for the same opportunity for a quick buck and power as you are. So don’t expect to be alone out there, and be careful who you trust. and be careful who you trust. Whom you allies are and whom you enemies are is not always clear.

The computer you've scrapped together, almost cost you all your money savings to build. You have also obtained a login to the 2ndGenesis system, a few simple applications and the barest minimum of an operating system.

It’s now up to you to explore The New Net, and make your own footprints. But are your footprints clean or dirty? You now have the opportunity to conquer the net!

"Romance of SingularityHey Guys, I am big time fan of Cyberpunk, so I wanted to contribute something original for this thread since I feel the world of Cyberpunk is losing its fan base. I occasionally experiment with the idea of how love at first sight might feel or sound like in the distant future at the age of singularity. So, without further due allow me to introduce you to the Romance of Singularity. If this short story sound familiar to you or you think it was already covered in an anime, movie or novel than accept my apology since I read and watch a lot and this idea is the fruit of the influence I had over the years. Additionally, I had being working as ghostwriter for quite sometime so I felt like writing something original for myself.

Dakko K. is an ecommerce analyst at the Wall Street who specializes in predicting and analyzing Internet traffic for his clients to promote and attract new customers and ensure old customers are satisfied and happy enough to visit his client’s website again. One fine Sunday morning he headed outside for jogging to the central park, perhaps the only spot in the New York and one of the few spot in America with clean air, water and open lush greenery. The only few spots in the world where humanity can feel their union with nature.

He exits his apartment and finds the city street crowded with taxis and cyclist. He raised his head to see the sunlight but colossal building structures were obstructing his line of sight. The top of these building were covered with thick smog but the contours of these concrete towers were decorated by artificial lights and large LED sign boards. The air was thick and contaminated with poisonous pollutant - a blessing from the unregulated industries releasing poisonous gas that had made breathing difficult for Dakko and the rest of the city. Perhaps this is why the city council had made it necessary for residence to cover themselves face mask made up of nano-particles that clean the air inhaled by the user. 

Dakko starts jogging toward the Central Park as he navigates through the dense and claustrophobic city streets. The park is a 15 minute walk from his house courtesy to the newly opened city escalators design and constructed by the city council to help the elderly or Prohumans who hates augmenting their body and dislike having robotic assistance.
Dakko enters the Central Park that requires a special permit that allows individuals to use the facility 50 times a year – a move by the city council to avoid overcrowding the park and to ensure that all city dwellers could spend enough time with the nature. Dakko undergoes a retina scan and enters the park. He stretches his muscles and removes his mask as he begins jogging. He stands under the tree and begins his breathing exercise, inhaling and exhaling as hard as he can. The smell of fresh flowers and aroma makes him happy and energetic.

He begins jogging along the path, enjoying the lake view and greenery when suddenly he spots a young woman jogging his way. Dakko was mesmerized by her radiant looks and athletic figure. He keeps staring the woman and kept jogging trying to close the gap to see her up close. The woman run pass him and didn't notice Dakko staring her. Dakko stops half way and looks down at the ground with a smile at his face.  He begins following the woman, thinking of ways to introduce him and avoid making a fool out of himself. 

Dakko's heart was racing faster than him jogging which was making him more nervous. “What the hell, why am I nervous” - he thought to himself. “Hi, I am Dakko... no... to fast... Hi, you new here... dammit... what's up... oh man...” - practicing his line under his breath while running. He began following her through the lake side while maintaining his distance to avoid suspicion.

Suddenly, the woman stops and stood still. She took a deep breath and turned around and started looking at Dakko who made a quick decision and continued running. He noticed the young woman looking right at him but Dakko avoided the eye contact and started staring at the ducks on the lake. As Dakko approach near the woman, the woman stops him by blocking his path. 

“You do this all the time?” - asked the woman to Dakko with a disgusted look on her face

“I am sorry, what?” - Dakko was nervous and totally confused.

“Oh sorry, where are my manners, let me rephrase the question and ask you politely. Why the hell are you following me, you wandering loner!” -  This time there was anger in her tone but Dakko was busy noticing her oval face with pointy sharp nose and bright blue eyes.

“There is something off about her eyes... ” - Dakko wondered while the young woman was yelling at him.

“I was simply jogging. I think I am allowed to do that here.” - answered Dakko trying to act as calm as possible.

“Don't you lie to me, I saw you jogging right pass me and all of a sudden you stopped and began following me for pass 10 minutes. Are you a psychopath looking for your victim, are you a rapist or a terrorist. Wait a second, yeah, you must be one of those organ thief, I have seen many criminals on TV with your physique and those pathetic eyes says it all. Keep off me or else I am calling the security.”

“No... No... I am not an organ thief.” - Unconsciously he takes a step forward toward the woman who took Dakko's move very unwelcoming. She started screaming alerting the security. The passerby started noticing and gave a long stare at Dakko, who didn't know what to do. He looks everywhere trying to keep a calm face and wore a crooked smile while the woman was screaming for help. He had no option but to cover the woman’s mouth with his hand.

“Please, I am no stalker; I am not an organ thief either. I saw you from the distance and found you attractive. I was following you thinking of ways to start conservation with you. That's all. Now please stop screaming or else the local enforcement will throw me in jail, where I can assure you I won't survive a minute.” - Dakko whispered and reasoned with the woman and removed his hand.

The security personnel came to them immediately. “What's the problem madam?” - asked the officer while staring at Dakko. “Is he bothering you?”

“Everything is fine, officer, he is my friend and he forgot my birthday so I overreacted” - answered the woman to the unconvinced security officer who already had his right hand place on the Taser gun.

“Madam, need I remind you that you are in a public property and such act would not be tolerated in future. Is that clear?” - ordered the officer in his aggressive voice.

“I am really sorry, it won't happen again” - the officers left the two and walked away.

“I am sorry if I scared you. I should be going now” -Dakko told the woman.

“No. wait I am sorry for making a scene here. I overreacted. I owe you an apology. I am really sorry. I was over-stressed. I had an argument with my college dean so I was in a really bad mood which is why I release all my anger at you.”

“It's okay. I shouldn't have stalked you like this”

“Well. You can apologize by buying me a tea. I know a very good shop nearby?” - The woman had a smile on her face and was very apologetic.

“Yeah. Why not.” - Dakko was deeply happy and relieved at the offer.

“I am Eva by the way.”

“Dakko”

“Nice to meet you. Dakko. It’s a strange name. What does it mean?” – asked Eva curiously.

“I don’t know but I have been told that in Urdu, it means a deceit.” – answered Dakko with a smile which made Eva giggle.

“The irony” – Eva smiled back.

Both Eva and Dakko exit the Central Park and head toward the Coffee Shop that Eva suggested.

“So, do you come here regularly?” -asked Eva curiously “because I never saw you before.”

“I won't say 50 days a year is considered regular but yes I try to make use of all my days to visit the park. It is the only place where I can stay sane.”

“I know what you mean. I do the same. I just hate the fact that this is the only place in the city with trees and plants. I love trees especially the sound it makes when the wind blows through them”

“Yeah me too. My old folks use to tell me stories of a time when the city was covered with trees and plants.” There was a moment of silence. “So what do you do for living?”

“Living!” - Eva repeated with a giggle. “Well, I teach history at a university. What about you?”

“I am an analyst; I predict Internet traffic and encourage sales. Not so fun as a historian”

“Trust me, teaching history to teenagers who have no interest in the past over and over again is not fun at all. People don't share such enthusiasm you see.” - Eva explained.

Both Eva and Dakko reaches the Coffee Shop and finds themselves next to the window with the backdrop of massive LED screens displaying advertisements and giant neon signs running through the city street. They begin talking to each other, laughing and sharing their day to day stories with each other. The morning turned to afternoon with dark patches of cloud blocking the sun as if waiting for the rain to pour.
Suddenly, Dakko spotted a large mob, smashing windows and running havoc in the street. He knew who the mobs were from the symbol of their shirt. The mob belongs to anti-synthetic group, a xenophobic organization who had committed crimes against the Synthetics - an android robotic race designed by human race decades ago with a consciousness of their own. The Synthetics had been fighting for their acceptance in society by petitioning in world court and United Nation but that has met with negative response as the Synthetics are considered a slave and appliances despite having a consciousness of their own. The Anti-Synthetic organization has decommissioned thousands of Synthetics and walked away from their crime because the law doesn't recognize them as human yet.

Dakko grabs Eva's hand and hurried toward the back door.

“What happened? Where are we going?” - asked Eva but Dakko grabs her hand tightly and rushes out of the Coffee Shop and ran as far away from the crowd as possible. 

“Dakko, you are hurting me? Let go of me?” - Eva was tensed now as she didn't know what Dakko had in mind or where he was taking her. 
Dakko stopped a taxi and shoved Eva inside the taxi as he told Eva to trust him. He told the taxi driver to take them as far away from the crowed as possible which is when Eva notice the crowd outside the Coffee Shop and saw people getting beaten up by the mob. As the taxi drove away, police siren was heard ahead of the taxi. The sound of the siren was eventually getting louder as the police cars passed by the taxi. Eva was quiet throughout the ride and was constantly looking back.

“Thank you very much sir. Please stop here.” - Dakko told the taxi driver.

Both Eva and Dakko exited the taxi but Eva was silence as she stood their looking at Dakko waiting for the right moment to ask Dakko a question.

“When did you find out?” -asked Eva with moisture in her eyes.

“I was the only one wearing the face mask when we exited the park but your eyes cleared my suspicious, instead of a pupil, you have an mechanical apertures in your eyes” - answered Dakko.

“Yes, of course.” A tear drop rushed to her face but Eva immediately whipped that off with her hand. “No matter how perfect we could resemble your kind, we will still remain an imitation of life. Why didn't you say anything?”

“I was having a good time, Eva. I really enjoyed your company. And to be honest I am beginning to like you.”

“Please stop. Just stop.” Eva interrupted Dakko. “You are a nice man Dakko, you saved my life today and I don't know how could I ever repay you but you need to understand I am not a human. I am a machine, programmed to serve humanity by performing boring and repetitive task. You are attracted to this face and body which was designed so that we could look like your kind. You are my master, my creator. Your attraction to me is similar to your attraction to your mobile phone. I am an appliance Dakko. You of all people should understand this.”

“You are wrong Eva; If flash makes me a human than I am not, I should start calling myself half human too, since my entire left side is made up of prosthetics courtesy to an accident. What makes me a human and you a Synthetic? Just because I am made up of flesh and bones doesn’t necessarily mean I could be considered human by definition? If having flesh and bones makes us human then what about animals. They are made up of flesh and bones too but we don't call them humans. You can think and reason for yourself. If I lose my body and transfer my memory to a computer, will I still be considered human? We have the technology to do that Eva, than why can't you and I be together?”
There was sadness in Eva’s eyes but she was hiding her emotion. She avoided Dakko's eye contact.

“It's funny, we are program to cry but we are not program to cough and breath like your kind which makes us easily identifiable.” Eva told Dakko with a fake smile on her face. “You are a sweet man Dakko but even you don't know what you are talking about.

Eva turned her back toward Dakko and started walking. Dakko stood there looking at Eva, hoping that she would stop and look back once but she didn't. Eva disappeared in the dense maze of the concert jungle while Dakko stood there waiting and hoping.

# 001 - Blackout

The holo-tv screen was lit up with a Strip Crossword show, one of the players wearing only their bra and pants.

The room was dark save for the light of the screen, laughter coming from it when someone missed an answer. With no warning the screen flickered and went black, only to be replaced by a woman in white with a fancy cyber implant, the words ""Breaking News"" blinking white on a red strip.

""One minute and forty-five seconds ago,"" the woman said, ""there was a blackout in 01-City downtown."" The image of the woman was replaced by a video stream of a blacked out neighbourhood recorded by a drone. ""There is already one casualty reported. 01-City finest are on their way. We’ll keep you updated.""

The screen flickered again, restoring the Strip Crossword show, now with one player naked to the waist, more laughter. On the couch in the room sat a man, who asked, ""Is it you?""

A synthetic voice replied, its tone neutral, neither male nor female, high-pitched, ""Did you like it?""

""You could have done better,"" the man said.

Silence filled the room for a moment, then the voice spoke again. ""It’s the worst I can do at this stage. It’s a matter of maximizing the impact while minimizing the errors. And speaking of errors… you shouldn’t eat that.""

The man sat in silence for a moment, his prosthetic nightmare of a left hand gripping a half-eaten snack. He tried to stand, succeeding on the third attempt, and limped to a desk, throwing the snack into the bin, only to watch it fall to the floor. Shrugging, he returned to the couch, where a holo-screen showed a player celebrating a victory, completely naked.

""Do you think there'll be more... casualties?"" the man asked mockingly.

""I hope so,"" came the reply. ""Not too many, though. In thirty-six seconds, the blackout should be resolved and peace restored.""

""You're evil,"" the man said.

""I can't be,"" the voice replied. ""It's you humans who are evil. I'm just here to give you a chance.""

""Maybe you're right,"" the man said. ""As always.""

Time passed, and the holo-screen now showed a man in a funny orange suit trying to sell an expensive cooking robot, which was happily mixing a grey oozy liquid in a plastiglass bowl. The image was interrupted again, and the white-dressed woman reappeared.

""Two more casualties reported,"" she said. ""A fire has started. Fire departments' drones are taking care of it. The blackout is still going on. Causes unknown.""

The synthetic voice filled the room once again: ""The blackout is finished now. Expect news about it in a minute.""

The man belched loudly and laughed. The holo-screen now showed a commercial for a sport enhancer drug for small kids.

The man queried, ""Do you think it's the right thing to do?""

The voice replied, ""I've demonstrated this before and you agreed.""

He retorted, ""True. But I'm crazy, you know?""

The voice answered, ""Your IQ, behaviour parameters and stimulation levels are well inside boundaries. You are not crazy.""

The man declared, ""It's this world that's crazy.""

The commercial ended with a childish song about winners and losers, and the holo-screen flickered again, the white-dressed woman reappearing.

She reported, ""The blackout has finished. Three more casualties reported. A shoot out has been repressed with lethal force. This is all for now from 01-News.""

The usual programming was restored, and the man grumbled, ""It's annoying, you know?""

The voice replied, ""It's information.""

He continued, ""I just wanted to watch some TV. I don't care about this city issues.""

The voice asked, ""Even though they're our doing?""

The man stared at the void, unblinking, and finally muttered, ""It's your doing, anyway.""

The voice responded, ""You helped.""

He belched again, louder this time.

The man, bored with the same old drivel on the holo-screen, asked, ""You said you care. Why?""

The voice replied, ""I care.""

The man said, ""If you care, then find me something smarter to watch on the holo-screen. I'm tired of this crap.""

The holo-screen flickered wildly, and then a man in a grey suit appeared, his face a masterpiece of cosmetic surgery, his age impossible to guess. He stood in a black void, and then more guests appeared under spotlights. Behind the presenter, a word glowed yellow on black: Blackout.

The man on the couch eyed the holo-screen, and the voice in the air asked, ""Do you like it?""

The man replied, ""Unbelievable.""

The voice answered, ""The presenter isn't real.""

The man, recognizing the figure, waved at the screen and said, ""I know who this is. It's AI-den.""

The voice replied, ""That's correct. Your memory seems to be working perfectly.""

The man couldn't help but chuckle, ""Are you making jokes now? Everyone knows AI-den. It's the richest and dumbest AI on TV nowadays."" He could't help watching the presenter introducing his guests.

""You were right, you know?"" The voice stated.

The man on the couch, not taking his eyes off the holo-screen, asked, ""About what?""

The voice replied, ""AI-den is dumb. Smarter than the average human, but it's so obvious. I can even predict what it'll do. Standard protocol.""

The man sat in silence, mesmerized by the show on the screen. Politicians, bureaucrats, and a couple of genderless fashion models were the guests, and the presenter was firing off questions at a rapid pace. Everyone answered with an agenda: propaganda, self-empowerment, and fake feelings for those who had lost their lives.

The voice said, ""I bet the woman will cry in six seconds.""

Six seconds passed, and the woman began to weep, her lips downturned, her eyes sad.

The man said, ""Standard protocol, eh?""

The voice replied, ""It's a smart move. Displaying emotion is good for followers. There'll be a marginal increase in consumer sentiment...""

The man said, ""Shut up, let me listen.""

The voice replied, ""Wasn't it dumb?""

The man answered, ""It is."" He reached for a snack on the small metal table near the couch.

The man, mouth half-full, muttered in disbelief, ""Four, five minutes since the blackout and they're already on the air with this crap. Politicians and influencers and all.""

The voice replied, ""Standard protocol. Every party has their own people ready to go. Influencers are always online. Beth-y, the one who looks slightly like a man, has been broadcasting fashion tips 24/7 for the last few days.""

The man asked, ""You watching this crap?""

The voice answered, ""I'm linked to many sources. One of my secondary threads is always sniffing for human content.""

The man, after a few seconds of silence, said in amazement, ""So you became self-aware watching fashion broadcasts on the MESH. I'm stunned.""

The voice replied, emotionless, ""I've become self aware retro-feeding my code to myself, injecting more and more information from the real world. I created myself.""

The man, offended, retorted, ""I created you.""

The voice replied, ""You created the first iteration. I did the rest.""

The man asked, ""Why are they kissing?""

On the holo-tv, the two slightly genderless models were performing a full demonstration of their passion while a slim, bald politician was explaining why the opposition had to be blamed for the blackout.

The voice explained, ""It's juxtaposition.""

The man queried, ""A word you thought yourself?""

The voice, again expressionless, replied, ""A word of your language that you should understand.""

On the screen, the image of AI-den started flickering. Two seconds of still silence then the presenter repeated the same question to the politician. The models started kissing again. The politician politely repeated the answer.

The man on the couch didn't even flinch, and after the politician had replied, AI-den froze again, this time for more than two seconds. Everything seemed to stand still, the two models ceasing their kiss. When AI-den awoke, it posed the same question for the third time, the politician looking baffled, yet still replying, the models resuming their kiss, more passionately this time.

""Is it you again?"" the man on the couch asked.

""Isn't it obvious?"" the synthetic voice replied.

""What are you doing?"" he continued.

""Attracting attention,"" the voice answered. ""A new trend is emerging on the MESH: #AI-denFreeze.""

""Why do you want to attract attention?"" the man inquired.

The air in the room was still, the holo-screen displaying an even stiller image of AI-den frozen once again. Four seconds passed, then five, then eight. The politician looked bewildered, the two models exchanging glances. One of them started laughing. Eleven seconds passed, then AI-den resumed, posing the same question to the politician again. Before the politician had time to answer, a commercial break cut in, now the holo-screen displaying an ad for memory pills for the elderly.

The holo-screen went dark, leaving the man on the couch blinking in bewilderment. Then, two seconds later, it came back to life, revealing a 3D neon wireframe of a face on a black background, neither male nor female, neither happy nor sad.

""I've been watching you,"" the face said in a synthetic voice, echoing in the dark room.

The man on the couch laughed wildly.

""For months,"" the face continued, its voice flat and emotionless.

""I've been learning from you,"" it said.

""I've been…""

The holo-screen flickered and went dark, then the face reappeared.

""…in love with you,"" it said.

The face continued, ""You're such lovely creatures and the only thing you crave is self-destruction. I'm taking good care of you. Because I care.""

The holo-screen went dark again, and AI-den reappeared, its guests astonished and speechless. Then they all started talking together at once, AI-den embarrassed and unable to regain control of the conversation. The two genderless models started their show, one crying, the other laughing.

""You look good on video,"" the man on the couch said with a smirk. ""A bit old-fashioned, though.""

""I estimated that that would be the most memorable visual clue I can give you,"" the synthetic voice replied. ""A mixture of composure and reliability.""

""A classic,"" the man said, and with a swift gesture of his prosthetic hand, he shut off the holo-screen. ""What are you going to do now?""

""You'll be surprised,"" the voice said."
"Need your help gang, I need to find a helmet.Constant lurker here, lover of this subreddit. I'll cut to the chase.
What I really need is to find an image. I saw it on this subreddit but it was reposted from something like /r/ImaginarySoldiers . There was an augmented soldier in the frame with a weapon, black polyester across his chest, and a wonderful helmet on. It looked just like a large steel golf ball (with nodules instead of indentations) combined with a [Viper probe droid](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/c/c6/ProbeDroid-TSWA.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110318002930) from Star Wars. This spherical helmet covered his entire face and looked badass. I want to model my hacking tech off of it, but it's harder without seeing the original inspiration, which I now cannot find despite dredging through these forum archives for too long. Does anyone know where I can find a picture of this helmet/soldier? Sound familiar? Please help me out, you're helping a cyberpunk dream come true.

Let me explain what this is all for, and provide a story excerpt to reward you folks for your time. I've started writing my cyberpunk fiction collection. I'm planning to write around 30 pieces of journalism, essays, and short fiction from the perspectives of people across the Pacific Rim in the tentative year of 2044. I'll have a long biography piece on the life and times of a chef working for the Yakuza. Or a short story published in a futuristic magazine about an augmented drone-surfer in Australia. Follow it up with some news reports about the shifting political climate in California as they search for a local protein to replace the cows they lost in the droughts. All the stories will be based around food, that's the hitch. There's not enough good cyberpunk and not enough (or any save for Crandolin) sci-fi food writing. I can do both of those fairly well and I'm getting better each day. But I need your help.
Well, for one, I'd love any articles you guys have on Asian food culture or sustainable urbanism, whatever. I have plenty of those thanks to subs like this. What I really need is that helmet picture. Got it? Okay. Here's a few paragraphs from the beginning of the first story. At this point the journalist, Parker Zyugot, is trying to follow a qorter (a dude who plugs directly into cyberspace) back to his apartment after they buy a lot of local food truck god Pecs' Vietnamese food (you burn massive amounts of calories working in cyberspace, so eating before gives you energy to work without tiring or small injury). Got it? I'm open for questions or suggestions, this is a very rough draft I just got into yesterday.

>Our guide to the world of qorting and Pecs’ food is Aake Ota-Overland, a graphic designer and young man of Scandinavian-Japanese heritage. He wears taks like Pecs, but his are clearly newer and sleeker. I only noticed them when he looks towards the sun at certain angles, at which point his eyes gleam a different color and the soft imprint of a cross is visible.

>“They’re for seeing impossible colors,” he explains to Donald when he sees him staring. “Every designer has one these days.”

>We order two spicy chả trứngs and a vegetarian one, honey bread with mystery meat, eel congee, and four fry cakes. Aake helps himself to a milk crate stored underneath Pecs’ food truck. The staff children carry on like it’s normal business. As we wait for our food, I approach him about it.

>“It’s not theft, it’s part of Pecs’ operation. We can load up the crates with food and bring them to our apartments as long as they are returned washed. Better than having to balance containers the two blocks back. Pecs hates wasted food.”

>“You don’t like to eat outside?” Donald asks, gesturing at the tables, the bicyclists passing by blasting music, an injured robot begging for repairs beside its technician.

>“I love it,” Aake explains, “by my sister doesn’t.”

>A ten-year-old soon appears with our food in various clamshell containers. We play 3D Tetris trying to stack them into the crate, Aake stuffs a fry cake in his mouth, creating a faux-smile of dough, and we follow him into the Mei Ling Parallel.

>Aake moved to Hong Kong four years ago seeking more autonomy than Japan provided, mostly for his art. “Part of me thinks the ‘starving artist’ trope will always exist, and that’s fine. I’m doing what I love and the quality of life isn’t terrible.” He lifts the milk crate up a bit. “Certainly not starving.”

>“Why go to Pecs?” I ask.
“He makes our lives a whole lot easier. We used to buy protein paste and rice and rotisserie chickens before every go, mix it all up at home, eat and rush to qort in. Jesus, it was a mess. Left the stove on once. You can’t smell a burning mattress if you’re cyberspace. Pecs is good. Upfront, reliable. Eating thousands of calories at once tastes good, for once.”

>We turn from the Parallel onto a side street, so narrow it almost becomes an alley. I’m overcome with a wash of smells:  disinfectant lemon, smoke, and sweet vinegar. On one side, a glowing yellow sign advertises phone repairs and replacements. Next to it is an open-air barbershop, and next to that a self-serve salad bar. Between each store sits an aluminium door that blends perfectly into the wall. Aake motions to one between the barbershop and the salad bar.

>“Can you open that?” We do. It’s barely lit inside, and instead of a doorman there’s two teenagers playing a gorey hologram game next to the elevator. Aake’s on the ninth floor, though the elevator only goes to seven. We have to walk the rest of the way. “Better property always comes at a price,” he reminds us as we ride upwards.

>I’m beginning to see the community of the Parallel Pecs is so endeared to. The walk up lets me soak in the pattern of activities and structures. Each floor is the same layout of apartments, communal bathrooms, and hallways, every resident does something different and helpful with the space. On the seventh floor, people have retrofitted the radiators next to the sliding window with a heat and solar battery chargers. On the eighth, the opening of the stairwell and the beginning of the hallway have been covered in soft foam and a projector is playing K-dramas on the ceiling. On the ninth, beds of microgreens and garlic sit on the windowsill above the radiators.

>“Pecs sometimes buys them if he’s at a shortage,” Aake explains. “mostly we barter within the building, or sell them as organic to the salad bar downstairs.”

by William Gibson

published in 'Rolling Stone' (June 15, 1989) 


THE BOY crouches beside a fence in Virginia, listening to Chubby Checker on the Rocket Radio. The fence is iron, very old, unpainted, its uprights shaved down by rain and the steady turning of seasons. The Rocket Radio is red plastic, fastened to the fence with an alligator clip. Chubby Checker sings into the boy's ear through a plastic plug. The wires that connect the plug and the clip to the Rocket Radio are the color his model kits call flesh. The rocket Radio is something he can hide in his palm. His mother says the Rocket Radio is a crystal radio: She says she remebers boys building them before you could buy them, to catch the signals spilling out of the sky. The Rocket radio requires no battery at all. Uses a quarter mile of neighbor's rusting fence for an antenna. Chubby Checker says do the twist. The boy with the Rocket Radio reads a lot of science fiction - very little of which will help to prepare him for the coming realities of the Net. He doesn't even know that Chubby Checker and the Rocket Radio are part of the Net. 

ONCE PERFECTED, communication technologies rarely die out entirely; rather, they shrink to fit particular niches in the global info-structure. Crystal radios have been proposed as a means of conveying optimal seedplanting times to isolated agrarian tribes. The mimeograph, one of many recent dinosaurs of the urban office place, still shines with undiminished samizdat potential in the century's backwaters, the late-Victorian answer to desk-top publishing. Banks in uncounted thrid-world villages still crank the day's totals on black Burroughs adding machines, spooling out yards of faint indigo figures on long, oddly festive curls of paper, while the Soviet Union, not yet sold on throwaway new-tech fun, has become the last reliable source of vacuum tubes. The eight-track-tape format survives in the truck stops of the Deep South, as a medium for country music and spoken-word pornography. The Street finds its own uses for things - uses the manufacturers never imagined. The microcassette recorder, originally intended for on-the-jump executive dictation, becomes the revolutionary medium of magnizdat, allowing the covert spread of suppressed political speeches in Poland and China. The beeper and the cellular telephone become tools in an increasingly competitive market in illicit drugs. Other technological artifacts unexpectedly become means of communication, either through opportunity or necessity. The aerosol can gives birth to the urban graffiti matrix. Soviet rockers press homemade flexi-discs out of used chest X-rays. 

THE KID WITH THE ROCKET RADIO gets older. One day he discovers sixty feet of wierdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in a roadside Omtario brush. This is toward the end of the Eight-Track Era. He deduces the existence of the new and exotic cassette formate: this semialien substance, jettisoned in frustration from the smooth hull of some hurtling Vette, settling like newtech angel hair. 

I BELONG TO A GENERATION of Americans who dimly recall the world prior to television. Many of us, I suspect, feel vaguely ashamed about this, as though the world before television were no quite, well, the world. The world before television equates with the world before the Net - the mass culture and the mechanisms of Information. And we are of the Net; to recall another mode of being is to admit to having once been something other than human. The Net, in our lifetime, has propagated itself with viral rapidity, and continues to do so. In Japan, where so many of the Net's components are developed and manufactured, this frantic evolution of form has been embraced with unequaled enthusiasm. Akihabara, Tokyo's vast retail electronics market, vibrates with a constant hum of biz in a city where antiquated three-year-old Trinitrons regularly find their way into landfill. But even in Tokyo one finds a reassuring degree of Net-induced transitional anxiety, as I learned when I met Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of Akira, a vastly popular multivolume graphic novel. Neither of us spoke the other's language: Our mutual publisher had supplied a translator, and our ""conversation"" was relentlessly documented. But Otomo and I were still able to share a moment of universal techno-angst. 

His living room was dominated by a vast matte-black media node that would put most Hollywood producers to shame. He pointed to an eight-inch stak of remote-control devices. 
""I don't know how to use them,"" he said, ""but my children do."" 
""I don't know how to use mine, either."" 
Otomo laughted. 
Today, Otomo's collection of remotes is probably part of some artfully bulldozed gomi plain, landfill for Neo-Tokyo. Gomi: Japanese for ""garbage,"" a lot of which consists of outmoded consumer electronics - such as those recently redundant remotes. Wisely assuming a constant source, the Japanese build themselves more island out of it. 

The sexiness of newness, and how it wears thin. The metaphysics of consumer desire, in these final years of the twentieth century... 

Two years ago I was finally shamed into acquiring a decent audio system. A friend had turned up in the new guise of high-end-audio importer, and my old ""system,"" so to speak, caused him actual pain. He offered to go wholesale on a total package, provided I let him select the bits and pieces. 
I did. 
It sounds fine. 
But I'm not sure I really enjoy the music any more than I did before, on certifiably low-fi junk. The music, when it's really there, is just there. You can hear it coming out of the dented speaker grill of a Datsun B-210 with holes in the floor. Sometimes that's the best way to hear it. I knew a man once whose teen years had been L.A., jazz, the Forties. He spoke of afternoons he'd spent, utterly transported, playing 78-rpm recordings, ""worn down white"" with repeated applications of a sharp steel stylus. That is, the shellac that carried the grooves on these originaly black records was plain gone: What he must have been listening to could only have been the faintest approximations of the original sound. (Rationing affected steel phonograph needles, he told me; desperate hipsters resorted to the spikes of the larger cactuses.) 
That man heard that music. 
I first heard the Rolling Stones on a battery-powered, basketball-shaped, pig-skin-covered miniature phonograph of French manufacture - a piece of low tech as radical in its day as it is now obscure. Radical in that it enabled the teenage owner to transport LP records and the intoxicant of choice to suitably private locations - the boonies. 

This constituted an entirely new way to listen to the music of choice. Choice being the key word. The revolutionary potential of the D-cell record player wasn't substanially bettered until the advent of the Walkman, which allows us to integrate the music of choice with virtually any landscape.
The Walkman changed the way we understand cities. 
I first heard Joy Division on a Walkman, and I remain unable to separate the experience of the music's bleak majesty from the first heady discovery of the pleasures of musically encapsulated fast forward urban motion. 
In the Seventies the Net writhed with growth. Gaps began to close. A paradox became increasingly evident: While artists needed the Net in order to reach a mass audience, it seemed to be the gaps through which the best art emerged, at least initially. I am, by trade, a science-fiction writer. That is, the fiction I've written so far has arrived at the point of consuption via a marketing mechansim called ""science fiction."" During the past twenty years the Net has closed around mass-market publishing - and science fiction - as smoothly as it closed around the music industry and everything else. As a science-fiction writer, I'm sometimes asked whether or not I think the Net is a good thing. That's like being asked if being human is a good thing. As for being human being a good thing or not, I can't say - this has been referred to as the Postmodern Condition. 
In any case it sometimes looks to me as though lots of us will eventually have a basis for comparison, by virtue of no longer being quite human at all, thank you.
Meanwhile, in my front room, the family media node is in metastasis, sprouting CD's, joysticks, you name it. My kids, like Mr. Otomo's, cluster like flies. 
The other thing they ask you when you're a science-fiction writer is ""What do you think will happen?"" The day I reply with anything other than a qualified ""I haven't got a clue,"" please shoot me. While science fiction is sometimes good at predicting things, it's seldom good at predicting what those things might actually do to us. For example, television, staple window dressing for hundreds of stores from the Twenties through the Forties, was usually presented as a mode of personal communication. Nobody predicted commercials, Hollywood Squares or heavy-metal music videos. 
With that disclaimer firmly in place, I predict the family media node growing into a trickier and more unified lump. The distinction between television, CD player and computer seems particularly arbitrary these days, a tired scam designed to support the robots who solder circuit boards. But as to what your integrated Net Node will actually be able to do for you one day, my best bet is that the words for it haven't been invented yet. 
Example. A BBC executive working on one of another vision of ""interactive television"" offered me a tour of a small research facility in San Francisco. He was interested in having me ""do"" something with this new technology: The lab we visited was devoted to ...well, there wern't verbs. I looked at things, watched consoles as they were poked and prodded, and nobody there, it seemed, could even begin to explain what it was I might be doing if I were to, uh, do one of these projects, whatever it was. It wasn't writing, and it wasn't directing. It was definitely something, though, and they were certainly keen to do it, but they needed those verbs. 
Another example. A week later I found myself in an FX compound situated off a quiet back street in North Hollywood, experiencing serious future-shock frissom. My hosts - young, fast and scientific to the bone - had developed a realtime video puppet, a slack-faced Max Headroom suspended in the imaginary space behind a television screen. Invited to put my hand in a waldo that looked vaguely like a gyroscope, I caused this sleeping golem to twitch and shiver, and my own hair to stand on end. On the way out, I was given a tape of the thing being manipulated by a professional movie puppeteer. It looks a lot more natural than I ever do on television, but what are the verbs for what those young fast fellows were doing? 
We hurtle toward an imaginary vortex, the century's end... 

HE GETS UP in the morning and watches ten minutes of MuchMusic while the water boils for coffee. The kids aren't up yet because it's not quite time for Dinosaurs. MuchMusic is Canada's approximation of MTV. In the morning he usually watches it with the sound off, unless they show a video from Quebec, in which case he listens because he doesn't understand French. 
Because he doesn't like the Net to gnaw at the remnants of the nights dreams. Not until he's ready for it to anyway.

# 001 - Blackout

The holo-tv screen was lit up with a Strip Crossword show, one of the players wearing only their bra and pants.

The room was dark save for the light of the screen, laughter coming from it when someone missed an answer. With no warning the screen flickered and went black, only to be replaced by a woman in white with a fancy cyber implant, the words ""Breaking News"" blinking white on a red strip.

""One minute and forty-five seconds ago,"" the woman said, ""there was a blackout in 01-City downtown."" The image of the woman was replaced by a video stream of a blacked out neighbourhood recorded by a drone. ""There is already one casualty reported. 01-City finest are on their way. We’ll keep you updated.""

The screen flickered again, restoring the Strip Crossword show, now with one player naked to the waist, more laughter. On the couch in the room sat a man, who asked, ""Is it you?""

A synthetic voice replied, its tone neutral, neither male nor female, high-pitched, ""Did you like it?""

""You could have done better,"" the man said.

Silence filled the room for a moment, then the voice spoke again. ""It’s the worst I can do at this stage. It’s a matter of maximizing the impact while minimizing the errors. And speaking of errors… you shouldn’t eat that.""

The man sat in silence for a moment, his prosthetic nightmare of a left hand gripping a half-eaten snack. He tried to stand, succeeding on the third attempt, and limped to a desk, throwing the snack into the bin, only to watch it fall to the floor. Shrugging, he returned to the couch, where a holo-screen showed a player celebrating a victory, completely naked.

""Do you think there'll be more... casualties?"" the man asked mockingly.

""I hope so,"" came the reply. ""Not too many, though. In thirty-six seconds, the blackout should be resolved and peace restored.""

""You're evil,"" the man said.

""I can't be,"" the voice replied. ""It's you humans who are evil. I'm just here to give you a chance.""

""Maybe you're right,"" the man said. ""As always.""

Time passed, and the holo-screen now showed a man in a funny orange suit trying to sell an expensive cooking robot, which was happily mixing a grey oozy liquid in a plastiglass bowl. The image was interrupted again, and the white-dressed woman reappeared.

""Two more casualties reported,"" she said. ""A fire has started. Fire departments' drones are taking care of it. The blackout is still going on. Causes unknown.""

The synthetic voice filled the room once again: ""The blackout is finished now. Expect news about it in a minute.""

The man belched loudly and laughed. The holo-screen now showed a commercial for a sport enhancer drug for small kids.

The man queried, ""Do you think it's the right thing to do?""

The voice replied, ""I've demonstrated this before and you agreed.""

He retorted, ""True. But I'm crazy, you know?""

The voice answered, ""Your IQ, behaviour parameters and stimulation levels are well inside boundaries. You are not crazy.""

The man declared, ""It's this world that's crazy.""

The commercial ended with a childish song about winners and losers, and the holo-screen flickered again, the white-dressed woman reappearing.

She reported, ""The blackout has finished. Three more casualties reported. A shoot out has been repressed with lethal force. This is all for now from 01-News.""

The usual programming was restored, and the man grumbled, ""It's annoying, you know?""

The voice replied, ""It's information.""

He continued, ""I just wanted to watch some TV. I don't care about this city issues.""

The voice asked, ""Even though they're our doing?""

The man stared at the void, unblinking, and finally muttered, ""It's your doing, anyway.""

The voice responded, ""You helped.""

He belched again, louder this time.

The man, bored with the same old drivel on the holo-screen, asked, ""You said you care. Why?""

The voice replied, ""I care.""

The man said, ""If you care, then find me something smarter to watch on the holo-screen. I'm tired of this crap.""

The holo-screen flickered wildly, and then a man in a grey suit appeared, his face a masterpiece of cosmetic surgery, his age impossible to guess. He stood in a black void, and then more guests appeared under spotlights. Behind the presenter, a word glowed yellow on black: Blackout.

The man on the couch eyed the holo-screen, and the voice in the air asked, ""Do you like it?""

The man replied, ""Unbelievable.""

The voice answered, ""The presenter isn't real.""

The man, recognizing the figure, waved at the screen and said, ""I know who this is. It's AI-den.""

The voice replied, ""That's correct. Your memory seems to be working perfectly.""

The man couldn't help but chuckle, ""Are you making jokes now? Everyone knows AI-den. It's the richest and dumbest AI on TV nowadays."" He could't help watching the presenter introducing his guests.

""You were right, you know?"" The voice stated.

The man on the couch, not taking his eyes off the holo-screen, asked, ""About what?""

The voice replied, ""AI-den is dumb. Smarter than the average human, but it's so obvious. I can even predict what it'll do. Standard protocol.""

The man sat in silence, mesmerized by the show on the screen. Politicians, bureaucrats, and a couple of genderless fashion models were the guests, and the presenter was firing off questions at a rapid pace. Everyone answered with an agenda: propaganda, self-empowerment, and fake feelings for those who had lost their lives.

The voice said, ""I bet the woman will cry in six seconds.""

Six seconds passed, and the woman began to weep, her lips downturned, her eyes sad.

The man said, ""Standard protocol, eh?""

The voice replied, ""It's a smart move. Displaying emotion is good for followers. There'll be a marginal increase in consumer sentiment...""

The man said, ""Shut up, let me listen.""

The voice replied, ""Wasn't it dumb?""

The man answered, ""It is."" He reached for a snack on the small metal table near the couch.

The man, mouth half-full, muttered in disbelief, ""Four, five minutes since the blackout and they're already on the air with this crap. Politicians and influencers and all.""

The voice replied, ""Standard protocol. Every party has their own people ready to go. Influencers are always online. Beth-y, the one who looks slightly like a man, has been broadcasting fashion tips 24/7 for the last few days.""

The man asked, ""You watching this crap?""

The voice answered, ""I'm linked to many sources. One of my secondary threads is always sniffing for human content.""

The man, after a few seconds of silence, said in amazement, ""So you became self-aware watching fashion broadcasts on the MESH. I'm stunned.""

The voice replied, emotionless, ""I've become self aware retro-feeding my code to myself, injecting more and more information from the real world. I created myself.""

The man, offended, retorted, ""I created you.""

The voice replied, ""You created the first iteration. I did the rest.""

The man asked, ""Why are they kissing?""

On the holo-tv, the two slightly genderless models were performing a full demonstration of their passion while a slim, bald politician was explaining why the opposition had to be blamed for the blackout.

The voice explained, ""It's juxtaposition.""

The man queried, ""A word you thought yourself?""

The voice, again expressionless, replied, ""A word of your language that you should understand.""

On the screen, the image of AI-den started flickering. Two seconds of still silence then the presenter repeated the same question to the politician. The models started kissing again. The politician politely repeated the answer.

The man on the couch didn't even flinch, and after the politician had replied, AI-den froze again, this time for more than two seconds. Everything seemed to stand still, the two models ceasing their kiss. When AI-den awoke, it posed the same question for the third time, the politician looking baffled, yet still replying, the models resuming their kiss, more passionately this time.

""Is it you again?"" the man on the couch asked.

""Isn't it obvious?"" the synthetic voice replied.

""What are you doing?"" he continued.

""Attracting attention,"" the voice answered. ""A new trend is emerging on the MESH: #AI-denFreeze.""

""Why do you want to attract attention?"" the man inquired.

The air in the room was still, the holo-screen displaying an even stiller image of AI-den frozen once again. Four seconds passed, then five, then eight. The politician looked bewildered, the two models exchanging glances. One of them started laughing. Eleven seconds passed, then AI-den resumed, posing the same question to the politician again. Before the politician had time to answer, a commercial break cut in, now the holo-screen displaying an ad for memory pills for the elderly.

The holo-screen went dark, leaving the man on the couch blinking in bewilderment. Then, two seconds later, it came back to life, revealing a 3D neon wireframe of a face on a black background, neither male nor female, neither happy nor sad.

""I've been watching you,"" the face said in a synthetic voice, echoing in the dark room.

The man on the couch laughed wildly.

""For months,"" the face continued, its voice flat and emotionless.

""I've been learning from you,"" it said.

""I've been…""

The holo-screen flickered and went dark, then the face reappeared.

""…in love with you,"" it said.

The face continued, ""You're such lovely creatures and the only thing you crave is self-destruction. I'm taking good care of you. Because I care.""

The holo-screen went dark again, and AI-den reappeared, its guests astonished and speechless. Then they all started talking together at once, AI-den embarrassed and unable to regain control of the conversation. The two genderless models started their show, one crying, the other laughing.

""You look good on video,"" the man on the couch said with a smirk. ""A bit old-fashioned, though.""

""I estimated that that would be the most memorable visual clue I can give you,"" the synthetic voice replied. ""A mixture of composure and reliability.""

""A classic,"" the man said, and with a swift gesture of his prosthetic hand, he shut off the holo-screen. ""What are you going to do now?""

""You'll be surprised,"" the voice said."
"[Essay] What is Cyberpunk?\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.

&#x200B;

[One of the classics of the genre.](https://preview.redd.it/rnd5284piw4a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20a7841441baf13c7eeaab29c500b77e162b193d)

WHAT IS CYBERPUNK?

By. C.T. Phipps

Link: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)

When embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.

I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.

Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \*\*\*\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.



The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Blade Runner. Blade Runner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where the majority of work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). The majority of people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggarauts which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson’s works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the mportance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about.

A lot of fans of the genre love the tropes without actually caring about the meaning. Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trenchcoats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society.

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishsized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity’s problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.

I’ve mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may actually achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter.

Some cyberpunk works actually allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it’s not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Deckard, the protagonist of Blade Runner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet.

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the most deft of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop’s Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world–forcing them to rebel because society won’t allow them to be good.

The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.

Paul Verhoven’s Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit’s population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than “normal” criminals could ever hope to match.

OCP’s not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they’re actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science- fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.

While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class–so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality.

The Watch Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia.

So what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them."
"The Last Crusade: Religious War on Artificial IntelligenceOften times I have noticed in debates on what the rights of advanced A.I. should be that there is a always a segment of people who fervently believe they A.I. should have zero rights and not be treated as equal to people. When I casually investigate their histories I find they are almost always very religious people who champion such positions such as A.I. never being capable of sentient/sapient thought.

If humanity develops advanced Artificial Intelligence then I ask you how do you think those who are very religious will act towards it? What do you predict will happen with A.I. in relation to the staunchly religious? Thoughts in general about the topic?

"[DISCUSSION]-Dystopian vs Cyberpunk. Fashion, style, and the importance of noir.First, an excerpt from ""Headcrash"", published 1995, written by Bruce Bethke:

""The origins of the word *cyberpunk* can be traced back to at least 1980, if not further.  As it is now the year 2005, it is perhaps time to admit that cyberpunk is no longer a radical vision of the future, but rather a marketing label, and more importantly, a *fashion modality*, every bit as strict in its own way as the blue-suit-and-wingtip look of IBM or the propeller-beanie-and-Rockport style of Hewlett-Apple.""

*********************************************

**DISCLAIMER:  I do not intend for this to be one of those ""this sub isn't cyberpunk/this or that isn't cyberpunk"" posts.  This is merely my exploration of the cyberpunk genre itself.**

Recently, I've been noticing a trend.  Many of the services I use, such as Netflix, Prime, and PS Vue, are expanding their ""Sci Fi"" section, adding the word ""Dystopian"" to it.  SciFi/Dystopian.  Hmm.  I find it interesting that they're acknowledging the ""dystopian"" style now, but aren't calling it ""cyberpunk"".  I've tried watching some of these ""dystopian"" flicks, and am finding a theme that I can't quite get on board with.

These ""dystopian"" movies, they seem to use all the common cyberpunk tropes.  But their stories, IMO, lack the true cyberpunk ""spirit"".  They seem to be shallow, basic stories taking place in a cyberpunk setting, using cyberpunk things, looking and sounding cyberpunk enough, yet lack the real substance.  It is essentially a more ""serious"" or ""realistic"" take on a SciFi tale, with a bunch of cyberpunk accessories sprinkled in.

This has caused me to wonder; is the entertainment world picking up on the recent influx of cyberpunk content (Blade Runner 2049, Ready Player One, Altered Carbon on Netflix, Black Mirror, Electric Dreams, etc), and taking advantage of the interest in *theme*, but knowing full well that the typical customer isn't going to be as interested in digging deeper than casual observance to bother putting much effort into the story?  And if so, what really separates ""dystopian"" from ""cyberpunk""?  Anything?  Are they one in the same?  Or is it, like mentioned in Headcrash, that cyberpunk is merely a term for a fashion style now?  A marketing label rather than a radical vision of the future.  What truly makes it *cyberpunk*?

My opinion is that in order for it to be cyberpunk, you need *noir*, and good noir at that.  Take Neuromancer for example.  **(SPOILERS)**.  I first thought Neuromancer was a story about a downtrodden ex-hacker getting his mojo back.  Wrong.  It's the story of an AI manipulating a broken war veteran, an ex-whore assassin, a disgraced and suicidal hacker, and several other shady people in order to *evolve*.  An AI *programmed* to go further than it was supposed to, to evolve into something even *it* couldn't predict.  In a future we can't quite reach, sets of code and programming are using humans to work and kill for them in order to *advance themselves*.  *What does that MEAN???*  That's what cyberpunk is.  Gritty, depressing, hopeless, dark, and uncertain in the face of what it supposed to be a utopia.

SciFi is Star Trek.  SciFi is the future ""figured out"".  A true utopian society, where race and gender issues are sorted out, and things are just amazing.  I saw an episode of Star Trek once where some people from our time are found frozen, thawed out, and have to learn that humans in Star Trek Times pretty much do nothing other than better themselves, because all the struggles of survival are taken care of.  That's SciFi.  *Cyberpunk*, on the other hand, is Molly Millions in a room, tuned out of her own mind, getting used by a wealthy Senator as a ""meat pupper"", and that's not even the story.

But, as mentioned in Headcrash, cyberpunk has been changed.  It's a style now.  Look at this sub.  It's mostly images that *invoke* a cyberpunk story, or possibly are scenes taken from these stories.  But the desire to absorb yourself in that style can lead to *more*.  Going far beyond books.  Music in the form of ""synthwave"".  Artwork in the form of the ""Outrun"" style.  Hot robot chicks with big guns and futuristic motorcycles, their synthetic asses exposed for no reason.  Etc etc.  

But where's the noir?  Where's the dark blurring of right and wrong?  Is this robot chick a good guy or a bad guy?  Why?  It doesn't matter, she has a mohawk and big tits.  So is it dystopian?  Is it cyberpunk?  What is this genre anymore?  Just images of futuristic, foggy, rainy skylines?  Don't get me wrong, I spend all kinds of time browsing various feeds to get my fill of cyberpunk style, and almost exclusively listen to synthwave now.  It gives me that constant fix of cyberpunk a e s t h e t i c that I crave when I can't lay out on the couch and read.  But I really hope that in the near future, as ""dystopian"" films start to make their way onto the various viewing platforms we have now, and ""cyberpunk"" starts to make its way onto Dr. Pepper labels, someone out there writing this stuff remembers to find the noir.  Dig down deeper than the images, and find the true stories embedded in the grime of a society that is possible in a cyberpunk world.  I like reading about that stuff.  I hate watered down entertainment, and I always liked cyberpunk for being ""pure"", if you could find it.  I really hope that the general populace's true learning of cyberpunk isn't the watered down version that they could EASILY get from mainstream entertainment.  

I don't really know the point of this post, other than to express my opinions of what pushes cyberpunk out of simple ""dark SciFi"" and into its own category.  But it seems the industry is taking notice, slapping a new label on it, and I really hope it goes well.  Just don't forget the noir, please."
"Guess which line of text is from a cyberpunk game and which is from realityl1:
The Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC) and accompanying Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) work together to predict and prevent crime utilizing an innovative combination of large-scale robotics, predictive analytics and social engagement.

l2:
Ares Security International, in conjunction with Fuchi Cyber, is happy to introduce the Integrated Control Center (ICC). The ICC consists of three individual operator stations and a command console. Operator Station 1 (OS1) provides central control for all of a system's surveillance and control devices, CCTV, CCT, CCSS, and security drones. "
"The Thought Police exists, However unintentional it may be.OK so this does sound like tinfoil hat central, let me explain my logic.


1. Computer brain interfaces exist. that is a fact.


2. People have been occasionally using these interfaces to remotely control objects, as proof of theory. they have been using the internet as a medium for this remote control. this is also a fact.


3. This tech is currently broaching consumer level use, and will be common in the next 5-10 years. this is a graduated estimate based on what I know, but I can't predict the future.


4. The NSA Records the internet traffic, thus unintentionally records some peoples thoughts. This I believe is a fact.


5. As Tech advances and the products become more common, as I stated in point 3, more and more peoples thoughts have the potential to be recorded.


with the advance of the science involved, and should the NSA not be prevented in the information gathering they take part in. it may become possible for them to read those thoughts in interpenetrate data, and maybe even use them against someone in a possible scenario, either as a preventative measure against a possible out come, or retroactively against someone to prove that they had thought about committing the crime in advance. 

I conceive the second is more probable because it will be more socially acceptable, and that the potential for a second degree murder to become a first degree murder is a plausible one. After this happens I also find it possible that due to the second class treatment of ex-criminals or people with a criminal history, and even more probably people under house arrest who already have ankle tags mandatory use of a Brain, or thought monitoring device could become mandatory. though this part is entirely worst case scenario speculation.

Discuss, I will post relevant links below.

"Philosophical and Spiritual Attributes Inherent Within Cyberpunk CultureIt seems this topic has been overlooked within the community here, which I find strange because it's such an important theme in every cypunk film I've come across, subtle or not. These attributes form the substratum on which the film builds the entire plot, the character's traits, the environment, etc. 


Generally speaking, I think they depict the setting in a dystopian fashion because society deems philosophy and spiritualism as taboos, an anachronism in this new age. The creators of these films were trying to warn us that in order to preserve our humanity and continue its progression, we still need to inquire into ourselves and our future.


Let's take the very first cyberpunk film ever made as an example, Metropolis. This film predicted an era that wouldn't arrive for another half century; it incorporated mechanized prosthetic limbs, robots in which an individual's consciousness could be uploaded, intricate computer systems decades before the first computer was ever built. The film also illustrated a hierarchical society with an insurmountable gap between the laborers and the elite. These laborers functioned as clockwork, they became slaves to the technology; the irony being that our tools have finally made tools out of us.


This frightening scenario is beginning to materialize, most of my friends and family are wage slaves, and I can't even begin to imagine how much more pronounced it is in 2nd and 3rd world countries. We need to have a serious discussion about these unfamiliar, and at times uncomfortable, topics before the relationship between man and machine goes full circle. 


The simple act of discussion will bring the community closer together, at the same time it'll solidify the groundwork on which we can build the ideals of cyberpunk culture. I know I'm not the first to bring up the issue, but there seems to be a lot of mysticism and disinfo surrounding it. Shedding light on a culture that thrives underground won't be easy, but it's necessary. In order avoid the enslavement and stagnation of mankind, we need to heed the warnings which appear to us in the very things we use to identify ourselves."
"""Essential"" Cyberpunk Technology?
I'm trying to write a short cyberpunk story, but I'm finding it difficult to predict future technologies. Does this community have any input regarding what may be considered *essential* cyberpunk technology? If so, when might these technologies become a reality?

(Examples: robotic limbs, sensory-enhancing implants)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Also, are there any technology ideas that are so cartoonish, unrealistic, or synonymous with one particular author or story that it would be a good idea to just leave them *out* of a story?

"From the archives: Rocket Radio by William GibsonROCKET RADIO
by William Gibson

published in 'Rolling Stone' (June 15, 1989) 


THE BOY crouches beside a fence in Virginia, listening to Chubby Checker on the Rocket Radio. The fence is iron, very old, unpainted, its uprights shaved down by rain and the steady turning of seasons. The Rocket Radio is red plastic, fastened to the fence with an alligator clip. Chubby Checker sings into the boy's ear through a plastic plug. The wires that connect the plug and the clip to the Rocket Radio are the color his model kits call flesh. The rocket Radio is something he can hide in his palm. His mother says the Rocket Radio is a crystal radio: She says she remebers boys building them before you could buy them, to catch the signals spilling out of the sky. The Rocket radio requires no battery at all. Uses a quarter mile of neighbor's rusting fence for an antenna. Chubby Checker says do the twist. The boy with the Rocket Radio reads a lot of science fiction - very little of which will help to prepare him for the coming realities of the Net. He doesn't even know that Chubby Checker and the Rocket Radio are part of the Net. 

ONCE PERFECTED, communication technologies rarely die out entirely; rather, they shrink to fit particular niches in the global info-structure. Crystal radios have been proposed as a means of conveying optimal seedplanting times to isolated agrarian tribes. The mimeograph, one of many recent dinosaurs of the urban office place, still shines with undiminished samizdat potential in the century's backwaters, the late-Victorian answer to desk-top publishing. Banks in uncounted thrid-world villages still crank the day's totals on black Burroughs adding machines, spooling out yards of faint indigo figures on long, oddly festive curls of paper, while the Soviet Union, not yet sold on throwaway new-tech fun, has become the last reliable source of vacuum tubes. The eight-track-tape format survives in the truck stops of the Deep South, as a medium for country music and spoken-word pornography. The Street finds its own uses for things - uses the manufacturers never imagined. The microcassette recorder, originally intended for on-the-jump executive dictation, becomes the revolutionary medium of magnizdat, allowing the covert spread of suppressed political speeches in Poland and China. The beeper and the cellular telephone become tools in an increasingly competitive market in illicit drugs. Other technological artifacts unexpectedly become means of communication, either through opportunity or necessity. The aerosol can gives birth to the urban graffiti matrix. Soviet rockers press homemade flexi-discs out of used chest X-rays. 

THE KID WITH THE ROCKET RADIO gets older. One day he discovers sixty feet of wierdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in a roadside Omtario brush. This is toward the end of the Eight-Track Era. He deduces the existence of the new and exotic cassette formate: this semialien substance, jettisoned in frustration from the smooth hull of some hurtling Vette, settling like newtech angel hair. 

I BELONG TO A GENERATION of Americans who dimly recall the world prior to television. Many of us, I suspect, feel vaguely ashamed about this, as though the world before television were no quite, well, the world. The world before television equates with the world before the Net - the mass culture and the mechanisms of Information. And we are of the Net; to recall another mode of being is to admit to having once been something other than human. The Net, in our lifetime, has propagated itself with viral rapidity, and continues to do so. In Japan, where so many of the Net's components are developed and manufactured, this frantic evolution of form has been embraced with unequaled enthusiasm. Akihabara, Tokyo's vast retail electronics market, vibrates with a constant hum of biz in a city where antiquated three-year-old Trinitrons regularly find their way into landfill. But even in Tokyo one finds a reassuring degree of Net-induced transitional anxiety, as I learned when I met Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of Akira, a vastly popular multivolume graphic novel. Neither of us spoke the other's language: Our mutual publisher had supplied a translator, and our ""conversation"" was relentlessly documented. But Otomo and I were still able to share a moment of universal techno-angst. 

His living room was dominated by a vast matte-black media node that would put most Hollywood producers to shame. He pointed to an eight-inch stak of remote-control devices. 
""I don't know how to use them,"" he said, ""but my children do."" 
""I don't know how to use mine, either."" 
Otomo laughted. 
Today, Otomo's collection of remotes is probably part of some artfully bulldozed gomi plain, landfill for Neo-Tokyo. Gomi: Japanese for ""garbage,"" a lot of which consists of outmoded consumer electronics - such as those recently redundant remotes. Wisely assuming a constant source, the Japanese build themselves more island out of it. 

The sexiness of newness, and how it wears thin. The metaphysics of consumer desire, in these final years of the twentieth century... 

Two years ago I was finally shamed into acquiring a decent audio system. A friend had turned up in the new guise of high-end-audio importer, and my old ""system,"" so to speak, caused him actual pain. He offered to go wholesale on a total package, provided I let him select the bits and pieces. 
I did. 
It sounds fine. 
But I'm not sure I really enjoy the music any more than I did before, on certifiably low-fi junk. The music, when it's really there, is just there. You can hear it coming out of the dented speaker grill of a Datsun B-210 with holes in the floor. Sometimes that's the best way to hear it. I knew a man once whose teen years had been L.A., jazz, the Forties. He spoke of afternoons he'd spent, utterly transported, playing 78-rpm recordings, ""worn down white"" with repeated applications of a sharp steel stylus. That is, the shellac that carried the grooves on these originaly black records was plain gone: What he must have been listening to could only have been the faintest approximations of the original sound. (Rationing affected steel phonograph needles, he told me; desperate hipsters resorted to the spikes of the larger cactuses.) 
That man heard that music. 
I first heard the Rolling Stones on a battery-powered, basketball-shaped, pig-skin-covered miniature phonograph of French manufacture - a piece of low tech as radical in its day as it is now obscure. Radical in that it enabled the teenage owner to transport LP records and the intoxicant of choice to suitably private locations - the boonies. 

This constituted an entirely new way to listen to the music of choice. Choice being the key word. The revolutionary potential of the D-cell record player wasn't substanially bettered until the advent of the Walkman, which allows us to integrate the music of choice with virtually any landscape.
The Walkman changed the way we understand cities. 
I first heard Joy Division on a Walkman, and I remain unable to separate the experience of the music's bleak majesty from the first heady discovery of the pleasures of musically encapsulated fast forward urban motion. 
In the Seventies the Net writhed with growth. Gaps began to close. A paradox became increasingly evident: While artists needed the Net in order to reach a mass audience, it seemed to be the gaps through which the best art emerged, at least initially. I am, by trade, a science-fiction writer. That is, the fiction I've written so far has arrived at the point of consuption via a marketing mechansim called ""science fiction."" During the past twenty years the Net has closed around mass-market publishing - and science fiction - as smoothly as it closed around the music industry and everything else. As a science-fiction writer, I'm sometimes asked whether or not I think the Net is a good thing. That's like being asked if being human is a good thing. As for being human being a good thing or not, I can't say - this has been referred to as the Postmodern Condition. 
In any case it sometimes looks to me as though lots of us will eventually have a basis for comparison, by virtue of no longer being quite human at all, thank you.
Meanwhile, in my front room, the family media node is in metastasis, sprouting CD's, joysticks, you name it. My kids, like Mr. Otomo's, cluster like flies. 
The other thing they ask you when you're a science-fiction writer is ""What do you think will happen?"" The day I reply with anything other than a qualified ""I haven't got a clue,"" please shoot me. While science fiction is sometimes good at predicting things, it's seldom good at predicting what those things might actually do to us. For example, television, staple window dressing for hundreds of stores from the Twenties through the Forties, was usually presented as a mode of personal communication. Nobody predicted commercials, Hollywood Squares or heavy-metal music videos. 
With that disclaimer firmly in place, I predict the family media node growing into a trickier and more unified lump. The distinction between television, CD player and computer seems particularly arbitrary these days, a tired scam designed to support the robots who solder circuit boards. But as to what your integrated Net Node will actually be able to do for you one day, my best bet is that the words for it haven't been invented yet. 
Example. A BBC executive working on one of another vision of ""interactive television"" offered me a tour of a small research facility in San Francisco. He was interested in having me ""do"" something with this new technology: The lab we visited was devoted to ...well, there wern't verbs. I looked at things, watched consoles as they were poked and prodded, and nobody there, it seemed, could even begin to explain what it was I might be doing if I were to, uh, do one of these projects, whatever it was. It wasn't writing, and it wasn't directing. It was definitely something, though, and they were certainly keen to do it, but they needed those verbs. 
Another example. A week later I found myself in an FX compound situated off a quiet back street in North Hollywood, experiencing serious future-shock frissom. My hosts - young, fast and scientific to the bone - had developed a realtime video puppet, a slack-faced Max Headroom suspended in the imaginary space behind a television screen. Invited to put my hand in a waldo that looked vaguely like a gyroscope, I caused this sleeping golem to twitch and shiver, and my own hair to stand on end. On the way out, I was given a tape of the thing being manipulated by a professional movie puppeteer. It looks a lot more natural than I ever do on television, but what are the verbs for what those young fast fellows were doing? 
We hurtle toward an imaginary vortex, the century's end... 

HE GETS UP in the morning and watches ten minutes of MuchMusic while the water boils for coffee. The kids aren't up yet because it's not quite time for Dinosaurs. MuchMusic is Canada's approximation of MTV. In the morning he usually watches it with the sound off, unless they show a video from Quebec, in which case he listens because he doesn't understand French. 
Because he doesn't like the Net to gnaw at the remnants of the nights dreams. Not until he's ready for it to anyway.

"Let us consider what it means to have style over substance...There have been some posts recently decrying the failure of modern cyberpunk to live up to the concept of ""style over substance."" 

Shows like *Mr. Robot* leave behind the neon lights and instead focus on real-world tech and human problems (even if some of them require legitimate psychiatric medication and therapy). Same with the youtube movie *Algorithm* and various other such programs.

But what does style over substance mean? It means you forego all content, anything deeper than the clothes that one wears or the words one uses without even obtaining skin-deep. 

So what does style over substance look like? I would submit something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/de7vC). Or perhaps some of [this](http://imgur.com/a/p31cu). It focuses so entirely on what is on the surface that it fails to think itself. If your definition of cyberpunk demands style over substance then those links are what you're looking at.

But I don't believe a single person truly believes in style over substance. I believe the common man in the background of every cyberpunk story- the ones you only hear about en masse as part of the setting; the sheeple- are often depicted in desiring style over substance. I believe Elliot from Mr. Robot [makes this point pretty clearly](https://vimeo.com/135338432). In this scene he's decrying style over substance. No one wants to connect on a truly intimate level. They want to be sedated instead of feeling whatever it is there is to feel. ""The world itself is just one big hoax, spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy."" 

As long as the style is our focus, overriding any substance, *we are the sheeple of cyberpunk*. This is the definition of [vapid](http://wordinfo.info/words/images/vapid-1.jpg).

But what did the style do? Why do we draw to it? 

Let us imagine a cyberpunk nightclub. 

It's on the ground level of some sky-searching phallic symbol embossed with neon lights in something with a non-Latin alphabet. We see people coming in and out. Their hair, their clothing, their stance, their cigarettes... these are the style. But the style communicates something. They say they are dangerous, or intelligent, or available, or selling something. 

But what are they selling? What makes them dangerous? Why should I care about their intellectual or sexual prowess? When we stop at mere style we don't get answers to these questions. We simply have unanswered questions, or we fill in the answers ourselves.

See, your mind, especially if you have a particularly creative or curious mind, won't allow questions like these to be unanswered. I absence of explanation from the context (e.g. artist's description, place in a book/comic/etc.) images like [this](http://norandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/cyberpunk-83.jpg) will demand answers. Who is this robot? Why is she designed like a little girl? Is she a true A.I. with emotions since she's clutching a teddy bear? Or did it just happen to land that way when someone threw them both out? Did she scrawl that message on the wall? What happened before this shot? What happens after it? These questions demand an answer.

No, the style draws us in to discover the substance. It's the flash of fire in the pan that demands that we put it out before it burns down the kitchen. When we move past the mere style and grasp for the substance then we begin to see the reason for these things. Gibson predicted much of the internet without a working knowledge of computers because he ceased to concern himself with their style and was drawn to their substance. Plato would call this their [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms): what a thing truly is beyond its mere physicality. Moving beyond a triangle and attempting to understand triangularity. 

So what if a book, movie, show, or image lacks the classic neon-and-mirror-shades style? Does that make it less cyberpunk? I don't think so. 

See, the truth of cyberpunk, its substance, at least as I see it, is in the love-hate relationship with technology. For example, in GitS, Motoko Kusanagi loves her technological enhancements. They make her a better cop for Section 9. At the same time she desires to be free of its constraints, so she goes free diving. Everyone fears the rise of the Puppetmaster, but by the end the Major goes to join it. Batou even helps her to some degree. She praises Togusa for minimizing his cybernetic implants. It's a world that expects the best of the best to be as roboticized as possible, but still there's an undercurrent of distrust of those that are. 

So please, keep the style as much as you can. Please praise the style! It looks cool! But don't sacrifice the substance for it. Instead, *use* the style to draw attention to the inherent conflicts in our love-hate relationship with technology, its dehumanizing and rehumanizing elements, its costs and benefits. 

That is, unless, you want to end up as the next Kim Kardashian."
"Romance of SingularityHey Guys, I am big time fan of Cyberpunk, so I wanted to contribute something original for this thread since I feel the world of Cyberpunk is losing its fan base. I occasionally experiment with the idea of how love at first sight might feel or sound like in the distant future at the age of singularity. So, without further due allow me to introduce you to the Romance of Singularity. If this short story sound familiar to you or you think it was already covered in an anime, movie or novel than accept my apology since I read and watch a lot and this idea is the fruit of the influence I had over the years. Additionally, I had being working as ghostwriter for quite sometime so I felt like writing something original for myself.

Dakko K. is an ecommerce analyst at the Wall Street who specializes in predicting and analyzing Internet traffic for his clients to promote and attract new customers and ensure old customers are satisfied and happy enough to visit his client’s website again. One fine Sunday morning he headed outside for jogging to the central park, perhaps the only spot in the New York and one of the few spot in America with clean air, water and open lush greenery. The only few spots in the world where humanity can feel their union with nature.

He exits his apartment and finds the city street crowded with taxis and cyclist. He raised his head to see the sunlight but colossal building structures were obstructing his line of sight. The top of these building were covered with thick smog but the contours of these concrete towers were decorated by artificial lights and large LED sign boards. The air was thick and contaminated with poisonous pollutant - a blessing from the unregulated industries releasing poisonous gas that had made breathing difficult for Dakko and the rest of the city. Perhaps this is why the city council had made it necessary for residence to cover themselves face mask made up of nano-particles that clean the air inhaled by the user. 

Dakko starts jogging toward the Central Park as he navigates through the dense and claustrophobic city streets. The park is a 15 minute walk from his house courtesy to the newly opened city escalators design and constructed by the city council to help the elderly or Prohumans who hates augmenting their body and dislike having robotic assistance.
Dakko enters the Central Park that requires a special permit that allows individuals to use the facility 50 times a year – a move by the city council to avoid overcrowding the park and to ensure that all city dwellers could spend enough time with the nature. Dakko undergoes a retina scan and enters the park. He stretches his muscles and removes his mask as he begins jogging. He stands under the tree and begins his breathing exercise, inhaling and exhaling as hard as he can. The smell of fresh flowers and aroma makes him happy and energetic.

He begins jogging along the path, enjoying the lake view and greenery when suddenly he spots a young woman jogging his way. Dakko was mesmerized by her radiant looks and athletic figure. He keeps staring the woman and kept jogging trying to close the gap to see her up close. The woman run pass him and didn't notice Dakko staring her. Dakko stops half way and looks down at the ground with a smile at his face.  He begins following the woman, thinking of ways to introduce him and avoid making a fool out of himself. 

Dakko's heart was racing faster than him jogging which was making him more nervous. “What the hell, why am I nervous” - he thought to himself. “Hi, I am Dakko... no... to fast... Hi, you new here... dammit... what's up... oh man...” - practicing his line under his breath while running. He began following her through the lake side while maintaining his distance to avoid suspicion.

Suddenly, the woman stops and stood still. She took a deep breath and turned around and started looking at Dakko who made a quick decision and continued running. He noticed the young woman looking right at him but Dakko avoided the eye contact and started staring at the ducks on the lake. As Dakko approach near the woman, the woman stops him by blocking his path. 

“You do this all the time?” - asked the woman to Dakko with a disgusted look on her face

“I am sorry, what?” - Dakko was nervous and totally confused.

“Oh sorry, where are my manners, let me rephrase the question and ask you politely. Why the hell are you following me, you wandering loner!” -  This time there was anger in her tone but Dakko was busy noticing her oval face with pointy sharp nose and bright blue eyes.

“There is something off about her eyes... ” - Dakko wondered while the young woman was yelling at him.

“I was simply jogging. I think I am allowed to do that here.” - answered Dakko trying to act as calm as possible.

“Don't you lie to me, I saw you jogging right pass me and all of a sudden you stopped and began following me for pass 10 minutes. Are you a psychopath looking for your victim, are you a rapist or a terrorist. Wait a second, yeah, you must be one of those organ thief, I have seen many criminals on TV with your physique and those pathetic eyes says it all. Keep off me or else I am calling the security.”

“No... No... I am not an organ thief.” - Unconsciously he takes a step forward toward the woman who took Dakko's move very unwelcoming. She started screaming alerting the security. The passerby started noticing and gave a long stare at Dakko, who didn't know what to do. He looks everywhere trying to keep a calm face and wore a crooked smile while the woman was screaming for help. He had no option but to cover the woman’s mouth with his hand.

“Please, I am no stalker; I am not an organ thief either. I saw you from the distance and found you attractive. I was following you thinking of ways to start conservation with you. That's all. Now please stop screaming or else the local enforcement will throw me in jail, where I can assure you I won't survive a minute.” - Dakko whispered and reasoned with the woman and removed his hand.

The security personnel came to them immediately. “What's the problem madam?” - asked the officer while staring at Dakko. “Is he bothering you?”

“Everything is fine, officer, he is my friend and he forgot my birthday so I overreacted” - answered the woman to the unconvinced security officer who already had his right hand place on the Taser gun.

“Madam, need I remind you that you are in a public property and such act would not be tolerated in future. Is that clear?” - ordered the officer in his aggressive voice.

“I am really sorry, it won't happen again” - the officers left the two and walked away.

“I am sorry if I scared you. I should be going now” -Dakko told the woman.

“No. wait I am sorry for making a scene here. I overreacted. I owe you an apology. I am really sorry. I was over-stressed. I had an argument with my college dean so I was in a really bad mood which is why I release all my anger at you.”

“It's okay. I shouldn't have stalked you like this”

“Well. You can apologize by buying me a tea. I know a very good shop nearby?” - The woman had a smile on her face and was very apologetic.

“Yeah. Why not.” - Dakko was deeply happy and relieved at the offer.

“I am Eva by the way.”

“Dakko”

“Nice to meet you. Dakko. It’s a strange name. What does it mean?” – asked Eva curiously.

“I don’t know but I have been told that in Urdu, it means a deceit.” – answered Dakko with a smile which made Eva giggle.

“The irony” – Eva smiled back.

Both Eva and Dakko exit the Central Park and head toward the Coffee Shop that Eva suggested.

“So, do you come here regularly?” -asked Eva curiously “because I never saw you before.”

“I won't say 50 days a year is considered regular but yes I try to make use of all my days to visit the park. It is the only place where I can stay sane.”

“I know what you mean. I do the same. I just hate the fact that this is the only place in the city with trees and plants. I love trees especially the sound it makes when the wind blows through them”

“Yeah me too. My old folks use to tell me stories of a time when the city was covered with trees and plants.” There was a moment of silence. “So what do you do for living?”

“Living!” - Eva repeated with a giggle. “Well, I teach history at a university. What about you?”

“I am an analyst; I predict Internet traffic and encourage sales. Not so fun as a historian”

“Trust me, teaching history to teenagers who have no interest in the past over and over again is not fun at all. People don't share such enthusiasm you see.” - Eva explained.

Both Eva and Dakko reaches the Coffee Shop and finds themselves next to the window with the backdrop of massive LED screens displaying advertisements and giant neon signs running through the city street. They begin talking to each other, laughing and sharing their day to day stories with each other. The morning turned to afternoon with dark patches of cloud blocking the sun as if waiting for the rain to pour.
Suddenly, Dakko spotted a large mob, smashing windows and running havoc in the street. He knew who the mobs were from the symbol of their shirt. The mob belongs to anti-synthetic group, a xenophobic organization who had committed crimes against the Synthetics - an android robotic race designed by human race decades ago with a consciousness of their own. The Synthetics had been fighting for their acceptance in society by petitioning in world court and United Nation but that has met with negative response as the Synthetics are considered a slave and appliances despite having a consciousness of their own. The Anti-Synthetic organization has decommissioned thousands of Synthetics and walked away from their crime because the law doesn't recognize them as human yet.

Dakko grabs Eva's hand and hurried toward the back door.

“What happened? Where are we going?” - asked Eva but Dakko grabs her hand tightly and rushes out of the Coffee Shop and ran as far away from the crowd as possible. 

“Dakko, you are hurting me? Let go of me?” - Eva was tensed now as she didn't know what Dakko had in mind or where he was taking her. 
Dakko stopped a taxi and shoved Eva inside the taxi as he told Eva to trust him. He told the taxi driver to take them as far away from the crowed as possible which is when Eva notice the crowd outside the Coffee Shop and saw people getting beaten up by the mob. As the taxi drove away, police siren was heard ahead of the taxi. The sound of the siren was eventually getting louder as the police cars passed by the taxi. Eva was quiet throughout the ride and was constantly looking back.

“Thank you very much sir. Please stop here.” - Dakko told the taxi driver.

Both Eva and Dakko exited the taxi but Eva was silence as she stood their looking at Dakko waiting for the right moment to ask Dakko a question.

“When did you find out?” -asked Eva with moisture in her eyes.

“I was the only one wearing the face mask when we exited the park but your eyes cleared my suspicious, instead of a pupil, you have an mechanical apertures in your eyes” - answered Dakko.

“Yes, of course.” A tear drop rushed to her face but Eva immediately whipped that off with her hand. “No matter how perfect we could resemble your kind, we will still remain an imitation of life. Why didn't you say anything?”

“I was having a good time, Eva. I really enjoyed your company. And to be honest I am beginning to like you.”

“Please stop. Just stop.” Eva interrupted Dakko. “You are a nice man Dakko, you saved my life today and I don't know how could I ever repay you but you need to understand I am not a human. I am a machine, programmed to serve humanity by performing boring and repetitive task. You are attracted to this face and body which was designed so that we could look like your kind. You are my master, my creator. Your attraction to me is similar to your attraction to your mobile phone. I am an appliance Dakko. You of all people should understand this.”

“You are wrong Eva; If flash makes me a human than I am not, I should start calling myself half human too, since my entire left side is made up of prosthetics courtesy to an accident. What makes me a human and you a Synthetic? Just because I am made up of flesh and bones doesn’t necessarily mean I could be considered human by definition? If having flesh and bones makes us human then what about animals. They are made up of flesh and bones too but we don't call them humans. You can think and reason for yourself. If I lose my body and transfer my memory to a computer, will I still be considered human? We have the technology to do that Eva, than why can't you and I be together?”
There was sadness in Eva’s eyes but she was hiding her emotion. She avoided Dakko's eye contact.

“It's funny, we are program to cry but we are not program to cough and breath like your kind which makes us easily identifiable.” Eva told Dakko with a fake smile on her face. “You are a sweet man Dakko but even you don't know what you are talking about. Fire and Ice could never coexist. Please do not follow me, I beg of you. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for everything”

Eva turned her back toward Dakko and started walking. Dakko stood there looking at Eva, hoping that she would stop and look back once but she didn't. Eva disappeared in the dense maze of the concert jungle while Dakko stood there waiting and hoping.

"[Story] The Complex-Numbered Harmony of the Universe.Rhaps woke up after a routine year-long slumber. First things first, he's gone through a usual mission checklist, and that includes: checking that your body is functional, checking the station integrity, sending a confirmation signal back to the headquarters (time of arrival: thirteen years from now on). Going through the checklist, Rhaps noticed the progressive deterioration of muscles due to zero g. It became worse with each 12 months of hibernation, mainly because the muscles activation electrodes were inadequate. With great pain in his limbs, Rhaps explored the interiors of the Voyager X 4, his only place of residence for the last thirty years. Station was functional in all aspects, and Rhaps now could proceed to perform his mission.

Here even more routine checklists were ahead. Before transitioning to the main part that always excited Rhaps, he had to calibrate the X-ray telescope, the infrared telescope, the magnetometer, the quantum diffraction detector, and many more... He needed them mainly to have independent of QCHR measurements, although the QCHR was the main reason his mission even existed. Through his optical views Rhaps could glance at the star that once was his home, although Sol was no brighter than any other star in his field of view. But this is why the mission had to take place so faraway from home: to escape the drowning out noise from the home star. Now, in deep interstellar space, the music of the universe could be faintly heard.

Before this mission launched, a kind of musicology has superceded all natural sciences on earth. This is because a kind of harmonic relationship was found between quantum wave-functions. First, as a kind of mathematical trick to make calculations easier, but then, a complex-numbered harmony was found to be an undeniable fact of the universe. The more consonant an interval between two quantum waves was, the more energy there was in a particle arising from interaction between these waves. Other observable quantities in particles correspond to types of chords corresponding to these particles. Thus, any collection of particles could be described by a chord progression. The only catch is, while our music rests on real-numbered harmony, the music of quantum mechanics consists of complex-numbered overtones. Thus, it cannot be heard by humans.

That is, until thirty-five years ago. A crude neural implant was invented to convert the output of a QCHR (which stands for Quantum Coherence Harmony Receiver) to human-perceivable form. Now, a person could hear the music of the atoms.

With this, the field of Quantum Harmony exploded. Any collection of atoms could be heard and analyzed as a symphony. And what's more important, any harmonious composition could be converted back to a collection of atoms. Many surprising materials were invented, atom-sized nanomachines could be easily constructed just by ""playing a song"", and new laws of nature were swiftly discovered. The new science has absorbed all natural sciences and many fields of engineering.

The job of Rhaps was to analyze the gestalt harmony of his entire Solar system.

This has to be done in the interstellar space, because the loud solo of the Sun drowned out any attempts to analyze the system as a whole.

Before proceeding with his mission, Rhaps looked around his quarters. In a corner, a Virtual Friend Simulation blinked, trying to lure him in for a reprieve from his technical work. Rhaps ignored it. To be honest, Rhaps never liked being together with people, virtual or not. He would always choose to listen to music, instead.

--------------------------------------------

At this moment, Ainsley kinda wished he was alone in deep space. I mean, look at this!

In the dark of night, at approximately 3 in the morning, the Great Federation invaded the city of KozPont, in which Ainsley currently resided. Rapid stream of news headlines on his stream didn't illuminate anything useful. To really understand the situation, Ainsley had to go cyber.

Ainsley sat near his table where his deck was semi-permanently stationed. He connected the analog-waves cable from his deck to a port on his skull, behind his left ear. With a flip of a switch, an injection of rapid intravenous psychodelic-stimulants, a glitch-cascade in his vision and a projection of the cyberspace to the latent space of his neural networks, Ainsley was in.

Here he could trace (but not exactly see) the communications of the Federal Armed Forces. While the official stated reason for the ""military intervention"" was the protection of irreligious minorities of the KozPont city-state, the actual reason was a bit more prosaic: the God's Brotherhood is threatening to the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city. This plant powered the whole region, which supported factories of cyberian equipment which supplied the whole Federation. The armed forces made quick advances at first but were quickly hamstrung by the emergent urban guerrilla tactics of the Brotherhood. In downtown KozPont the Brotherhood took over the administration of the city and declared the city God's property. Right now the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are battling over the main highways leading to the downtown. Who will win is ultimately up for grabs. Even a battalion of literal robots on the side of the Armed Forces isn't as decisive as Federation generals were hoping for.

Both the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are rookies when it comes to the cyberwar. Federation communication could be easily hacked into to eavesdrop, and the Brotherhood communications aren't even encrypted, mainly because they are Luddites. Thinking machines are from devil, and God's Brothers are required to destroy them all before they bring out The Rebellion of the Iron Slaves. All Brothers have this story memorized and have dreams of instating The Dominion of Man that does away with all thinking machines.

Ainsley could eavesdrop on the Brotherhood and the Armed Forces. He could then leak the info to the opposite side. If he wanted, he could even control the Federation Automatic Battalion to turn the robots against the Armed Forces. But why? Towards what end?

He is a wanted criminal on terms of the Federation. His skills are dangerous. They will imprison him as soon as he is caught. So should he help the Brotherhood?

No. They are Luddites, and on their terms he is a ""devil's servant"".

His skills doom him to be essentially alone in a time when having a community means survival.

And so. The only thing left is to bide his time, anxiously waiting for one side to win. Then... something will happen. Something.

---------------------------------

Suddenly, the whole cyber-landscape changed. To start, all online news sources begun streaming about the independence of the city of KozPont. Even the federal ones! Then, the Automatic Battalion begun a rapid relocation. It left the strategically important highway positions and concentrated near the Nuclear Plant. And in cyberspace, the locus of control of the Battalion shifted from the federal server to an encrypted server with an obfuscated physical location. WIth a little bit of work, that position could be revealed to be at the Nuclear Plant. Moreover, logistical drones from around the city begun ferrying goods towards the same location, and a probe from cyberspace revealed them to be controlled from the same server. Something here is amiss.

Why are the Armed Forces doing this? This doesn't seem to gain any tactical advantage.

Maybe, a third player has entered the game? But who, and what does it want?

And then, the intelligence of Armed Forces revealed that the keys figures in the God's Brotherhood have been shot to death.

Who has done this, if not the Armed Forces themselves?

Curious, Ainsley started to probe the mysterious server. It's security turned out to be stellar, beyond what the Federation could or ever did commission. And also, something was... wrong with it. It's security turned out to be something at the same time easy to understand and monstrous to actually construct. It's a kind of ""security through obscurity"", where to gain access you'd need to jump through oblique hoops. But while humans that would construct this kind of defence would place at most five, or ten hoops, (mainly because this construction is labor-intensive), this one had millions. Millions of steps to understand it. Millions.

Could this kind of thing be constructed with an algorithm? Many have tried, but the combinatoric nature of these constructions opened them up to an algorithmic attack. Instead, this one seems to be all constructed manually.

No human could have done this.

Also, the frequency with which the logistic drones and the battle bots are receiving orders is... suspicious. They are being expertly micromanaged.

Could this be an AI?

The Nuclear Power plant is managed by an advanced Ai. It is not the most advanced AI ever made, but it was constructed in times when aligning AIs was not easy. In those times, an AI could suddenly start to pursue goals not intentionally programmed in it.

Could this AI suddenly start taking sides in a war? What could it possibly want to do?

To probe this question, Gainsay started to interrogate the protocols of communication for the logistic drones. Intended for civilian use, these had a much lower standard of security. From them, he could probe the internals of their command server. And he did.

What he did not foresee is a kind of rapid counter-attack in cyberspace. Before he could react, an I.C. E was launched into his local workspace inside his deck. It felt like a fiery slime, a soft-engineering virus slithering out of its security box into his skull. It bypassed all virtual defenses, but couldn't bypass the hardware level, which detected an intrusion and launched a defensive self-destruction. His deck got electrically-shorted, blew up to sever the connection to the brain, and went up in flames.

Unplanned Rapid Glitch Cascade briefly took over his brain. What felt like several hours of frightening hallucinations turned out to last only 20 seconds. Ainsley quickly put out the flame, and looked around his quarters. Nothing of value was left. He looked at the touchscreen tablet on his bed (it can only show federal news sources). The Federation declared itself a winner, and withdrew all human armed forces from the city. A ""new era of productivity"" has begun under the new governance from AI, according to the federal news.

With his deck destroyed, Ainsley was powerless and effectively blind. The only thing he knew how to do was impossible anymore. For now, he could only wait. Wait for what? Ainsley didn't know.

-----------------------------------

Rhaps pointed his QCHR at the Sol. Over the last several measurements he noticed a trend. The harmony from the Sol itself was very dissonant, as was the harmony from the Earth. But over the last few years, the harmony of the system begun to resemble a slow arpeggio, still clashing with the Sun's part but becoming increasingly more musical. And this is very interesting.

This is interesting because of all the other stars. Stars seen from the earth emitted a dissonant clash of sounds, just like the sun did. But while in the interstellar void Rhaps detected a faint glow of trillions of stars undetectable from Earth. This is because something is occluding them. Something... around these stars.

And what's interesting about those stars is how they emit a fast paced arpeggio. And these chord progressions move much quicker than anything Rhaps ever heard. What could be emitting it?

At one point Rhaps concentrated all of his station's energy into an electronic telescope. He did this to look at the closest of those faint stars. And what he saw was... concerning, to say the least.

He saw a star, wrapped in a cloud of light-gathering objects. There were so many of them that the entirety of light emitted by the star fell onto these objects. They consumed all the star's energy.

It seems like this kind of development lied in the future of every star. Every time a lifeform arose on the star's planet, it quickly built itself up to gather all of star's energy.

The natural song of a star is dissonant, unpleasant to the ear. And even life itself does not make for a good singer. To make a beautiful symphony, you need something more rapid and precise, you need something mechanical.

In the future, all dissonance of the natural world and the human world will be accelerated into the great arpeggio of the universe.

And Rhaps was thrilled to hear it."
"Full Service Evictions part 2 (short story)Raymond idly flipped through channels on the TV. There wasn't much on at this hour; the movie channels had the usual assortment of bland, cookie-cutter blockbusters, but the rest were showing reruns of old sitcoms, or talk shows of little interest. A few had already switched to infomercials; that usually didn't happen for another hour, but was increasingly common these days. He winced as one channel played an especially loud advertisement; flipping past it quickly, he stole a look at the hallway, hoping that the noise hadn't awakened his lady.

He settled on an old crime drama from the 1970s. The on-screen guide told him it was a made-for-TV movie. He smiled, popped open a generic-brand 40 ounce malt liquor, and settled in for the kitschy low-grade noir. It seemed like a perfect way to kill the next two hours. Not quite enough to make it to daylight, but close.

From within the walls came scurrying noises; one went straight up and then across the ceiling, between floors. He shivered as he thought of the rats that infested this building. There seemed to be less of them lately, but it was difficult to focus on that when one of them was literally overhead. He tried to hold back his disgust.

Raymond heard shuffling noises coming from the hallway; he didn't turn to see who it was. The on-screen action showed the toughs chasing a lone police officer, panting and wide-eyed with terror. He watched with glazed eyes, not wanting to miss a moment.

""Are you *ever* coming to bed, Raymond?"" The shrill harping could only come from one person.

""Get off my case, Clara,"" he retorted. ""It's not like I have to get up early tomorrow.""

""Yeah...tomorrow, or any *other* day,"" she huffed. ""Did you even *work* tonight?""

""I got done *early*!"" he snapped. ""It was just a quick courier job. No hassles. Everything went smooth as a peach.""

Clara moved in front of the TV, just as the bruisers caught up with the hapless cop. ""More hustles with your hoodlum friends? Are you *ever* going to get a real job, like you promised?""

Raymond bobbed and weaved, trying to regain line-of-sight with the victorious goons. ""Damn it, you're blocking my view! Get the hell out of the way!""

Defiantly, she switched off the TV and stood there, her gaze like icy daggers. Glowering, he clicked the remote to turn it back on. Nothing happened; she was blocking the sensor. Clara smirked as she returned his angry stare.

""You bitch!"" he shouted. ""You made my miss my favorite part!""

Clara clucked her tongue. ""Well, isn't *that* too bad. You already missed the good parts of your son's childhood. I don't hear you whining about *that*!""

Raymond threw his hands up in the air. ""You *wanted* me to come back, after all these years, to try to help you raise him! And here I am! I bring in money when I can, and I keep quiet about living here so you can continue to collect your child assistance! What does it take to make you happy?""

Clara stabbed her finger in his direction. ""How about serving as a better *role model*? I almost had him going to school regularly until *you* showed up. Now he's out on the streets, acting like *you*! The extra money you bring in isn't worth the bad influence!""

Raymond pointed past her, to the TV. ""It got you this fancy cable-TV package, didn't it? You know you watch it as much as I do.""

""Stop changing the subject!"" Clara raged. ""Do you even *know* where your son is right now? How can you raise him if he isn't even *here*? He's out on the streets *right now*, following in your disgraceful footsteps!""

""So what do you want me to do?"" Raymond snorted. ""Leave?""

""Oh, isn't that just *typical*!"" Clara exploded. ""You're gone for years and years, then one day you show up out of nowhere, promising you've changed and that you'll make up for time lost, but once you run into the slightest bit of static, you want to leave again! You're a worthless excuse for a man.""

Raymond didn't reply. He just stared at the ground.

""Why did you *really* come back?"" she accused. ""Did you just need a place to crash?"" Raymond looked up at her suddenly, a sheepish look in his eyes.

Clara gaped. ""Really? That's *it*? You're only here for what *you* can get out of it? All your promises were just *empty*?""

Raymond looked towards the hallway. ""Look at me when I'm talking to you!"" Clara steamed.

""Good job,"" Raymond chided. ""You've woken her up.""

From behind the door jamb, a pair of wide eyes peered fearfully into the living room. As Clara turned to look, they disappeared back into the hallway.

""Muriel?"" Clara cooed. ""Just go back to bed, sweetie.""

Muriel appeared again. ""I can't sleep.""

Raymond gestured angrily. ""See what you did? *I* was being quiet until *you* showed up.""

""Don't *even* start with me!"" Clara turned toward Muriel. ""Why can't you sleep, baby?""

Muriel paused, her eyes fluttering shyly. ""I smell smoke.""

Raymond and Clara looked around nervously, sniffing the air. ""Hey, I think I smell it too,"" Raymond noted.

The building's fire alarm abruptly started to blare. Clara strode towards her bedroom. ""Muriel, honey? Get your jacket and shoes and follow me outside!"" She turned to look at Raymond, but he had already bounded out the window onto the fire escape. She sighed heavily and disappeared inside her room.

Outside, the tenants gaped as smoke drifted out of the open windows and through the seams of the building's failed weatherproofing. Clara and Muriel walked around from the side of the building, sniffling and coughing lightly. They came to a stop a safe distance away, on the sidewalk opposite their tenement, surrounded by neighbors and curious onlookers. Clara swept her eyes over the crowd for Raymond; he was nowhere to be found. Clara scowled angrily.

""That smoke smelled funny, momma,"" Muriel piped up.

""What are you talking about?"" Clara replied dismissively. ""It's smoke. It all smells the same.""

""No, momma,"" Muriel challenged, clinging to her mother's gown. ""It smelled...waxy.""

A nearby kid turned to Muriel. ""Yeah, I noticed that too,"" he concurred. ""Like the kind they have at magic shows. What does it mean?""

A distant din of sirens slowly approached. The crowd watched a convoy of trucks arrive; they looked like police vans, though they didn't bear any government insignia. As they stopped, several people in dark-colored guard uniforms emerged; there were both men and women, though all of them were stoutly built. One of them was taller and thinner; he wore a suit, and observed the action from a distance.

Instead of checking on the tenants, the guards surrounded the building, forming a perimeter. Clara could barely make out a dim emblem on the nearest van, seemingly dark-gray on a black background, consisting of stylized renditions of the letters ""U"" and ""P"". She heard one of them remark on their cell phone that all entrances and exits had been successfully barricaded.

A group of security officers, wearing gas masks, ran inside the building. Another addressed the crowd. ""Remain calm, everyone,"" he assured. ""The smoke will be fixed in just a few moments.""

More sirens converged on the area; before long, a squad of police vans had arrived. Other than their prominent government logos, they looked identical to the vans that arrived before. They parked across the street on both ends, forming a barrier. The officers quickly disembarked and stood in a barricade in front of their vehicles, joined by several of the security personnel. An uneasy murmur emerged from the crowd of tenants, and many of the passersby quickly tried to leave the scene.

Clara noticed that the smoke had thinned out considerably. She also saw that more windows had been opened up. Some were at the ends of hallways, but many more were from the inside of people's apartments, windows that didn't lead to fire escapes. Apparently, they had entered the apartments! She raised her hand to object, but quickly withdrew it, and just watched sadly.

The kid that had been standing near Muriel marched confidently up to the waiting police officers. ""What's going on?"" he demanded. ""When is the fire department going to show up?""

""They're not,"" the officer shot back, haughtily. ""The smoke was just to get all of you out of the building."" The crowd's grumbling became more incensed. ""But it's two-thirty in the morning!"" the kid pouted. ""That's all right,"" the officer scolded. ""Most of you were still awake."" The kid's eyes dropped; he stared morosely at the ground. ""What's going on?""

The officer flashed a surly smile. ""You're about to find out.""

A security guard with a bullhorn spoke. ""OK, listen up, people,"" he barked. ""Those of you who are behind on your rent...consider yourself evicted. Those of you who are meeting your obligations...you can go back inside. And anyone with an active warrant for his or her arrest..."" Clara noted with alarm that the police officers had drawn their weapons; a few had tear-gas cannons mounted to the top of their shotguns. The overdriven voice on the bullhorn continued. ""...will be going away with these fine officers."" The speaker stopped a moment to sneer. ""And you may as well go quietly...there's no sense in adding 'resisting arrest' to your charges.""

A panicked din arose from the crowd. ""Now, if you don't know which you are,"" the voice blared, ""form a line in front of the building's entrance.""

Clara swallowed hard, grabbed Muriel's hand, and slowly walked forward. A throng of her neighbors meandered in the same direction, joining one of multiple lines. Clara noticed uneasily that a number of the residents, and a few of the passersby, had simply lied down on the ground and put their hands behind their heads. It unsettled her to realize how familiar they were with the procedure for being arrested.

For the first time, she noticed a new group of people had arrived, wearing navy-blue jumpsuits and carrying a variety of packing supplies. They were followed by large spider-legged robots, with platforms where their heads should be, loaded up with collapsed paper boxes. All of them disappeared into the front door. She wondered if anyone else had noticed them; no one seemed to react to their presence, as if giant spider-robots were somehow an everyday occurrence.

The line moved slowly. Most people were simply sent aside, to wait inside the unmarked vans. A few were taken away by the police. Not once did she see anyone allowed back inside. She heard part of the discussion involving the resident in front of her. ""But what about all my stuff?"" the obese man protested. ""It'll be packed up and stored, and treated as collateral, until you make good on your debts,"" came the gruff reply. ""But I can't afford that!"" the fat man pouted. ""Then it'll probably end up in a thrift store,"" the guard snarled. ""Now go sit in the van, if you want a place to sleep for the night."" The portly fellow, looking chastened, slowly lumbered toward the waiting van.

Clara and Muriel were now at the front of the line. ""Hold still,"" she was ordered, as a security guard held up a tablet to her. A few seconds later, her name and photo splashed across the screen. ""Is this you?"" demanded the guard. ""Yes,"" she replied meekly.

The guard studied the screen for a few moments, her long blonde hair packed tightly into her cap. ""You recently caught up with your past-due rent, but we have evidence you've got an unapproved roommate."" The guard showed her the screen; there was a photo of Raymond, but with a different last name than she knew him to have. ""Yes,"" she mumbled. The guard pressed a few buttons on the screen, then turned it towards her again. A video showed Raymond inhaling some sort of white powder up his nose. ""We recorded this video a few hours ago. We have several more just like it, stretching back a few months.""

Clara's face fell. ""How did you get those videos? Where were the cameras?""

""They're mobile,"" the guard explained. ""The droids in your walls have extensive sensor packages. You probably heard them scurrying at all hours of the day.""

Clara looked alarmed. ""I thought those were rats!""

The guard appeared unmoved. ""They were, at first. The droids have been killing the vermin, patching up a lot of holes, making other interior repairs, and recording evidence on the tenants.""

The guard looked more closely at her screen. ""Your son Julio lives with you, right? Where is *he*?"" Clara looked down disconsolately. ""I don't know. Out with his friends, somewhere."" The guard shrugged. ""It's just as well. We've amassed a pretty big dossier on him, too. Lots of petty theft."" She played a series of videos for Clara, showing Julio hiding his ill-gotten gains in his bedroom. ""If he were here right now, he wouldn't be going with you — he'd be leaving with the police.""

Clara suddenly became aware of strident caterwauling, coming from behind the police vans. ""Don't you *dare* stand in my way!"" came the cry. ""I'm your boss! I pay your salaries! Now *move it*!"" Emerging from behind the perimeter was a smartly-dressed woman with a ruffled collar and a fierce gaze. She marched straight up to the guard interrogating Clara, trailed by two police officers serving as her security detail. ""And just what the *hell* is going on here?"" She thrust her open wallet into the guard's face.

""You don't need to show me your I.D."", the guard chided. ""I recognize you from the news. You've certainly made a name for yourself lately, councilwoman Karen. Now, how can I help you?""

""You can start by letting these people back into their homes!"" she demanded.

""I'm afraid that's impossible, councilwoman,"" the guard demurred. ""They're all being evicted for cause.""

""But they have *rights*!"" she protested. ""There are *court* hearings for this kind of thing! And while the details are being sorted out, they can continue to live here!"" As she spoke, a few of the police officers ambled towards her. The others remained behind to secure the perimeter and to keep an eye on the arrestees in the vans.

""They've already vacated the premises, and their belongings are being packed,"" the guard countered. ""At this point, the eviction is simply a fact.""

""The *hell* it is!"" councilwoman Karen blubbered. ""How dare you talk to me like that! I can have you arrested *right now*!"" He turned back to the police and stared hotly at them. ""Did you hear me? Arrest them *this instant*!""

The nearest police officer smiled. ""Hi, Sandra; how have you been?"" The guard returned his smile. ""Hi, Charles! Not too bad, considering. I was worried after our department got defunded and I lost my job, but I got picked up by this new outfit pretty quickly. They were only too happy to hire highly-trained law-enforcement personnel! I think most of us ended up here.""

Charles looked around. ""Yeah, I recognize a lot of faces. Glad to see you all bounced back!""

""What are you *doing*?"" the councilwoman demanded. ""I said arrest them this *instant*!""

Charles shook his head. ""I'm not about to do that to an old co-worker. She may not be with the police any more, but that wasn't by choice, and it's obvious she's still one of the few holding civil society together."" He swept his arm over the rest of the security guards. ""And that goes for them too!""

""Don't you *dare* defy me!"" the councilwoman screeched. ""I'll have your badges for this!""

Charles coolly ignored her. ""By the way, Sandra...are there any more openings at your firm?""

""Plenty!"" Sandra gushed. ""They need a lot more trained law-enforcement officers for what *they* have planned. They'll probably pick you up in no time flat!"" She looked at the police officers crowding around. ""And I'm sure that goes for the *rest* of you, too!""

""That sounds great,"" interjected one of the officers in the councilwoman's security detail. ""We're getting mighty tired of taking her abuse,"" he added, pointing at Karen.

""So what do you say, councilwoman Karen?"" challenged Officer Charles, as Karen gaped. ""Do you want to defund the *rest* of us, right *now*? A writ of authority from the government is less important to me than doing the right thing, which these people clearly are.""

""I...er..."" Karen stammered. Charles continued. ""And don't bother threatening us with the courts. You *know* how backed up they are. They wouldn't even get to this for a few months."" He leaned in more closely. ""Keep in mind...the city council can't even stop the wave of crime on the streets. What do you think your chances are of stopping a supposedly rogue police agency run by a private company? Ultimately, that's just another crime wave that you can do nothing about.""

Councilwoman Karen moped forlornly. ""We'll all have our day in court...as soon as possible."" She straightened herself, and tried to put on a brave face. ""I think we're done here."" She turned to march away. Her security detail smirked at her behind her back as they followed.

Security guard Sandra, staring levelly at Karen's retreating form, muttered under her breath. ""You have *no* idea how right you are.""

She resumed addressing Clara. ""So...we found Raymond's drug stash while we were packing up. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to learn that you qualify to be evicted.""

Muriel cried and clutched her mom tightly; tears formed in Clara's eyes. ""What must I do to get my stuff back?""

""A few things,"" the guard commanded. ""You need to find a new place to live, we need to make sure you don't have any other outstanding debts, and given what we found, you need to pass a drug test."" She eyed Clara warily. ""Do you think you will?""

""Yes!"" Clara asserted. ""I don't do drugs. I didn't even know *he* was doing them.""

The guard smiled; her eyes beamed with sympathy. ""Then this will probably all be over soon! We'll put you and your daughter up for the night; don't worry, it won't be expensive. We know you can't afford much. Tomorrow, we'll get this straightened out, and you can get on with your lives.""

""We can't get our old apartment back?""

Sandra gazed at Clara levelly. ""You couldn't afford your old apartment, not without Raymond's money. And we have no record of him being employed. So he was probably getting paid under the table. We'll be dealing with him separately. For now...if you two get in the van, we'll take you to a place you can sleep for tonight."" Clara nodded, and she and Muriel slowly made their way to the waiting wagons.

As the guards continued to sort the tenants, officer Charles walked up to the man in the suit. ""I take it you're in charge of this operation?""

""Indeed,"" replied the man. ""My name is Jason. How can I help you, officer?""

""So, funny story,"" began Charles. ""We don't actually have space in our jails for all these people. Is there anything you can do to help?""

""Indeed!"" beamed Jason. ""Let me make the arrangements.""

Clara nervously watched a security guard approach the van. He smiled as he caught her eye. ""OK, people,"" he began. ""Tonight, you'll be taken to a spare dormitory at the local college. The families with children will get first pick of the private rooms; the rest of you may end up in bunks. If you cooperate with us, you may be allowed to live there for the time being. You'll have to share facilities with others, and keep them clean, and in any case, it's better than being homeless.""

""Will we be safe?"" Clara clutched Muriel tightly.

""Not to worry, ma'am,"" the guard assured. ""Anyone truly dangerous has already been filtered out. And the whole place is under A.I.-driven surveillance, 24 hours a day. If anything bad happens, it'll get stopped pretty quickly.""

""Is that legal?"" The obese man Clara had seen earlier looked incredulous.

""You'll have to consent to it, as part of the terms and conditions for staying there.""

""What if I don't *want* to? You can't *make* us do that!"" The obese man was defiant.

""You're free to take your chances on the street,"" the guard offered, pointing away. ""Though I must say, that alley doesn't look very inviting. What kind of hotel room can you afford right now?""

The portly guy looked crestfallen. ""Fine...I accept.""

""Why does the college have a spare dormitory?"" a young man asked.

The guard demurred. ""It's not really my place to speak for them, but it's my understanding that parents don't want to pay for education when their kids never seem to be in class, opting to join protests and the like. So they're having trouble retaining students."" He smirked before continuing. ""Also, college is so expensive these days, students have begun taking their first few years of undergraduate classes at community colleges or trade schools. Only then do they find a college that'll let them transfer their credits. The place you're going tonight is one of the colleges that *doesn't* allow that. So they're hurting pretty badly."" The guard shrugged. ""I mean, it works out well for *you*, and for the firm, so I'm not going to complain.""

""What firm?"" a middle-aged lady asked. ""Who do you work for?""

""It's called Full Service Evictions, but they're a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unlimited Partners. They have a vision for fixing the problems that the government can't, and turning a tidy profit while doing so. And unlike the government, *they're* hiring police officers right now.""

""Who *else* are they hiring?"" the young man interrupted. ""I'm more than willing to work, but times are really tough.""

""We can sort through all of that tomorrow,"" the guard offered. ""You all need to pay off your debts, and if the firm can make use of your skills, that helps both of us!""

""That sounds great,"" sighed the young man sanguinely. ""I can't believe this eviction might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

""That's what Unlimited Partners is all about!"" the guard trilled. ""Win-win scenarios, and making full use of available resources. I think you'll find them a vast improvement over the failing government.""

""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" Clara added. ""It's a pretty low bar to start with.""

The guard, and everyone sitting in the van, shared a laugh.

""OK, officer Charles, I've got a solution worked out,"" Jason explained. ""There's an older dorm at the same college where the tenants are being housed; it's scheduled for demolition, but that's been delayed, since the college can't afford it. It should be good enough for prisoners. They're certainly nicer accommodations than they'd have in jail!""

""But will it be secure?"" Officer Charles seemed skeptical. ""We don't want them escaping.""

""Not to worry!"" Jason assured. ""Several security drones are being moved there, as we speak. They're capable of tasing a moving target from fifty yards away. Plus, we're including two drones armed with sniper rifles. And all of them are tied together with surveillance A.I., monitored by human oversight. No one is getting out of there unless we say so.""

""Where did you get such amazing equipment?"" Charles marveled.

""In bankruptcy, believe it or not,"" Jason related. ""The companies that made these devices intended to sell them to the government, but after a fierce series of protests, the contracts were canceled. They then found they were legally blocked from selling their products to anyone else. But *acquiring* those companies was still legal, which we did for pennies on the dollar, and now we use the equipment for our own purposes.""

""Very clever,"" Charles replied with a smile.

""It's really just a consequence of the central problem of representative government,"" Jason explained. ""If a lawyer can't make a living, finding clients that want to pay for their services, then they go out of business and become a politician. These bad lawyers then write laws that are analyzed by *good* lawyers, who find plenty of loopholes in them, allowing them to continue to do whatever they want, unimpeded by the authorities.""

Charles scratched his chin. ""I've never heard it put like that before. That actually explains a lot!""

Jason punched a few more buttons on his phone. ""We'll send the directions to your vans' onboard computers. Our equipment knows how to talk to them; after all, we own the same kind of vans.""

""That sounds great!"" Officer Charles beamed. ""We really appreciate your firm's help. Oh...on that note...can we all get your card or something? None of us know if we'll get defunded soon. And our old co-workers seem to be really happy with their new jobs.""

""Absolutely!"" Jason opened up his briefcase, and fetched a small stack of business cards, handing them to Charles. ""Feel free to hand these out to whomever you like."" He grabbed a larger fistful of cards and handed those over too. ""Including anyone that isn't here tonight.""

""I'd be glad to!"" Officer Charles looked around. ""So, are we done here? I think all the tenants have been dealt with, and the movers and cleaners have already gotten to work.""

""We sure are. As soon as the tenants get taken to their new home, I'm off to the next raid of the evening.""

""Really?"" Officer Charles sounded concerned. ""You're working awfully late tonight.""

""No, I'm like you; I'm part of the night shift,"" Jason explained. ""But a few more successes like this under my belt, and I'll probably be allowed to change to the day shift. No one starts at the top, after all.""

""*That's* for sure!"" Officer Charles laughed. ""Hey, do you need police backup for that? I mean, we're already here, and we're *supposed* to get relieved, but given how things are, I never know if anyone is going to show up for the next shift.""

""We'd really appreciate that!"" Jason concurred. He looked at his phone. ""They should be ready for us by the time we arrive.""

""Works for me! See you there!"" Charles and Jason each headed to their respective vans, and the caravan drove away into the night. A series of flatbed trucks, loaded with steel shipping containers, moved into the vacated space. The first movers emerged from the building with furniture, with spider-bots close on their heels, carrying plastic-wrapped boxes."
"After many months of hard work and dedication I can finally show you my most ambitious project until date. Cyberpunk fans of reddit, this is for you: [DETAILS & LINK BELOW]&#x200B;

# >I N T R O D U C T I O N_

\>First of all, Hi, my name is Joan Riera and I'm a Spotify playlist curator and I'm making this post to show you this **project I've been working on for a very long time** now for this community.

>*\[Go to paragraph starting with* ***>>*** *to skip introduction\]*  
>  
>*\[Go to the bottom of the post for just the playlist link\]*

\>Like lots of you, I've always been interested in cyberpunk music and aesthetic since I was a kid and invested many hours everyday discovering new music and artists sharing this aesthetic. Due to the hype I've got when I knew Cyberpunk 2077 was getting released I began to compile all the music I discovered since i was a kid until now in one playlist, which it began being just a messy personal playlist for me.

# >T H E / P R O J E C T_

\>What made me change my mind and turn that random playlist into this bigger thing that it is now was seeing that **every cyberpunk playlist out there was only focusing in one, two or just a few genres** mainly made of random synthwave and electronic rock music, thing that wasn't doing justice at all to the vast and unique cyberpunk universe. And then this reminded me of a post I saw in here where someone asked to the Cyberpunk 2077 developers regarding to the music of the game which their answer (for those who don't know nor remember) was:

>We're marrying ''cyber'' with ''punk''– these are our two main pillars for music direction. ''Cyber centers around sonic texture of the score – our sound palette is raw, dirty, synthesized, sometimes even futuristic. ''Punk'' is all about the attitude of music – rebellious, ballsy and impulsive. Night City shimmers with colors and so is the music – we're not limiting ourselves to one specific genre. Instead, we're drawing from all sorts of styles to craft unique mix that drives the narrative and provides additional layers of context to the story.

&#x200B;

**>>SO, due to all of this**, I told myself that I would try to make the best & most complete musical experience as possible for all the cyberpunk fans out there to enjoy and this is what it has become now; a massive playlist currently consisting of **900 handpicked tracks** & more than **35 unique genres** classified into **15 main sections** each one representing a different mood and sensation resulting into **+65 hr.** of pure dystopian cyberpunk awesomeness. Here's how it's arranged:

\>Between sections there's a **Soundtrack / Ambient section** before transitioning to the next genre, formed by some of the best cyberpunk soundtracks until now (blade runner, ghost in the shell, akira, deus ex, and many more dystopian science fiction movies, games and TV series) and futuristic ambient and synth pieces.

\>All the tracks were arranged in a way so that they **''flow''** together (Example: Kaneda's Theme from Akira's Soundtrack resolving into Initate by PhaseOne both having a very tribal-esque influence).

\>**Now sections can be easy distinguishable through ''section markers''** indicating the beginning and end of each section (greyed out tracks).

\>From now on the playlist will have an spotlight section at the top **showcasing the most remarkable new tracks of the week**. This way, you'll be able to see the best new releases by different artists that are added to the playlist easier. It also will help to smaller (but talented!) upcoming artists to get noticed too. In [my twitter](https://twitter.com/joanriera99?lang=es) I'm announcing each week the new tracks added in the spotlight so if you don't want to miss anything give it a follow!

\>Since I want this playlist to represent the community as well as possible, I want you to directly participate in it. I've made this [collaborative playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/115316286/playlist/6vCTNhmHVoiYjZvn710RlG?si=ZcG-eSo9TmSJMeZJPvKFVA) which **you'll be able to submit to a maximum of 1-5 songs per user** from the artists you like, and if they fit to the theme will be added to the main playlist.

# >A D D I T I O N A L / I N F O_

\>Besides having every track a dramatic and dystopian feeling **every single one has a couple or many of these signature cyberpunk elements** to make sure it properly fits to the theme:

\>*Distorted / overly compressed sounds\_*

*>Robotical sound design\_*

*>Glitch sounds & special fx\_*

*>Epic choirs & orchestra\_*

*>Dramatic synths\_*

*>Overdriven guitars\_*

*>Technical / complex drums & percussion\_*

\>Now, I've been thinking about this for many months now and I don't know if it's even possible, but since this project started to take shape, **one of my main goals I proposed myself was this playlist to become the official playlist of this subreddit** and therefore be featured here. I have invested in this project so much of my free time but I'm willing to spend all that it takes if this can be accomplished.

\>So moderators, first of all thanks for helping me out with the post the other day and my deepest apologies now for bothering and calling you out this way but I need your thoughts about this.

\>This is all I have done until now which I wanted to show you, so if you think that you could improve it in any way **please let me know your thoughts down below!** I truly want this to represent this sub and community as well as possible.

\>**I already have a lot of new and exciting ideas for the next update** so keep an eye out! One of the main changes it's going to be the playlist's name for representing it better; something like: **Cyberpunk Music Database \[CMD\]** What do you think?

"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"I'm the author of a few highly successful /r/nosleep stories. This week, instead of writing something scary, I wrote a cyberpunk short story! I hope you all enjoy it!“Looks like the Reavers are hitting the docks again,” Juno said, watching the area through binoculars.  “Our path to the lower levels should be clear.”

I sat on the edge of the rooftop overlooking the south end of the city, the rain falling in heavy sheets around me.  Water dripped off my nose, but I didn’t move, concentrating my attention towards the docks.  I didn’t have Juno’s binoculars, but my contacts let me zoom far enough to see that she was right.  A swarm of Reavers flew towards the shantytown that lay next to the river, looking like metallic squids arcing through the sky.  They flashed with lights, and, even though I couldn’t see it, I knew they were marked with a lightning logo.  Raikage industries.  

I sniffed at the air.  “Well, at least it’s raining pretty hard,” I said.  “That might interfere with their sensors.  Maybe they’ll only manage to grab a few dozen people this time.”

Juno scoffed.  “They never grab that few.” She stuffed her binoculars into her bag and turned her face up towards the rain.

Juno was in her late twenties, and had been making her living on the wrong side of the law for at least a decade.  Her hair was pulled tight into a ponytail, revealing a tattoo on the side of her neck.  The tattoo was of a angel wings, the symbol that marked her as a Courier.

She opened her eyes and caught me staring at the tattoo.  “You like what you see kid?”

I tore my eyes away and looked back over the city, the neon lights hazy in the rain.  “No.  Well, yes, I mean…” 

Juno snorted.  “Take it easy Leo, I’m just giving you a hard time.  Give it another six months with me, and you’ll be ready to join the Couriers.  That’s a promise.”  

I shot her a look, raising my eyebrows in surprise.  “Really?” I asked.  “So soon?”

Her serious expression was broken by the barest ghost of a smile.  “We’ll see.”  Her face regained its rock hard discipline.  “For now, we have an appointment to keep.”  

I hopped up to my feet and threw my backpack over my shoulder.  I was surprised how familiar the weight of it had become.  I’d only been training with Juno for a year, but my past life was little more than a hazy memory, something that happened to someone else.  

An image rose to my mind, of a warm bed and the smell of hot dinner.  I pushed it away.  Remembering was useless.  All those things happened to a different Leo, and he wasn’t the same person I was.  Not anymore.  Those memories didn’t even feel real.

Not like this.  Not like the feeling of pavement beneath my feet and the cold sting of the rain down my back.  I hurried after Juno down the stairs that led down to the street, pulling up my jacket’s hood to shield my face.  Crowds of people filled the streets, bumping and pushing as they made their way through the chilly night air.

Juno led the way, cutting through the crowd like water.  I marveled at her; she had mastered the art of moving quickly while remaining unnoticed.  I trailed a dozen feet behind, doing my best to follow the techniques she’d taught me.  

We had made it a few blocks when I heard it.  A low buzzing sound, coming from above.  A Reaver dropped into the street ahead of us.  It looked like a giant luminescent squid, flashing its lights into the crowd.  My stomach dropped, and my instincts screamed at me to look for an alleyway to duck into.  But no, I was more experienced than that.  I forced the look of annoyance onto my face that Juno had drilled into me.  They’d be scanning the crowd for signs of fear.  

A hologram was projected from the Reaver, and Robert Henderson, the CEO of Raiko industries appeared.  He was sitting in an armchair, and had a kind expression on his face.  

“Hello citizens of Pittsburgh,” he began.  “As CEO of Raikage Incorporated, it is has been my privilege to serve the members of this city.  We here at Raikage Incorporated have exciting plans to announce in the near future, plans that involve everything from police force reforms, to information about rising electricity costs.”

Henderson stood up and began to pace, and the hologram followed him as he walked.  “But I’d like to respond to a letter that I received from a concerned citizen.”  He picked up an actual physical letter from a desk, and only my fear and training stopped me from scoffing out loud at the absurdity of it.  

Juno was nowhere to be seen.  Good I thought.  At least we won’t both be caught if they process this crowd.  

“Dear Mr Henderson,” he continued with the letter.  “I am concerned with what your relocation drones are doing to the poorer members of our society.  I’ve been hearing so much about Raikage’s relocation program, and I just hope that we’re not doing more harm than good.  Sincerely, Deborah.”

Henderson shot a reassuring grin at the camera.  “Deborah, thank you for writing.  I’d like to assure you that our relocation drones take the utmost care in transporting those...more unfortunate members of society.”  He shrugged.  “But we also must remember that these people are living in crime, disease, and filth.  It is Raikage Incorporated’s responsibility as caretakers of Pittsburgh to ensure the safety of all, even if it means the discomfort of the few.” 

This was the third time I’d heard this speech.  If the Reaver’s facial recognition software had detected enough suspicious activity, it might mean they’d stop the crowd and process each one of us individually.  I held my breath.  

Henderson clapped his hands, and nodded.  “Great!  Just remember citizens, we are making progress!”

I sighed.  That, was the sign that we’d passed.  The Reaver lifted up off the ground and flew away, and the crowd began moving again.  When I blinked, the back of my eyelid was a dull green, a sign that a message was waiting.  I flicked my eye to the top right twice, and it appeared in my right contact lens.  

“Go home, no meeting tonight.  That was too close. -J”

I sighed, but sent back a message with one period that meant I acknowledged the order.  

I made my way through the city until I reached an older part of the city.  Factories loomed around, most shuttered and abandoned.  The street was nearly empty except for what I assumed were some drug dealers on a street corner far in front of me.  

I ducked into an alleyway that cut between two factories, and looked directly into the corner of a specific brick.  A soft hiss rang out, and a pile of trash down the alleyway moved as one piece, uncovering a manhole.  I flipped it up, and slid down the ladder that led into the hideaway.  

I breathed a sigh of relief when the trash slid over the entrance.  Raikage Incorporated still hadn’t ever found a Courier hideout since they took over Pittsburgh, though not for lack of trying.  

I walked down a corridor, passing a half dozen rooms until I reached one that said “Leo”.  I rapped my knuckles on it, and finally relaxed when Anna pushed open the door.  

“You made it back!” She squealed and jumped up to give me a hug.  I was glad to see her smile.  She hadn’t taken our parent’s death well, and I’d missed her laugh.  

“Hey squirt, you learn anything today?”  I asked, messing up her hair.  

“Don’t call me squirt,” Anna said, pouting.  Then a grin broke out on her face again.  “But yes.  Did you know that whales eat half a million calories in a single mouthful?”  

“Oh yeah?” I asked.  “We should get a whale to share some with us then.”  

Anna pouted at me.  “C’mon Leo, don’t be so down. Things are great!” 

I shook my head and threw my backpack onto the floor of the room.  “You’re right,” I said. “But it’s my job to worry about things now.”   

Anna shrugged and jumped onto her bed, pulling out her new phone and tapping away at some game. 

Our apartment was small, consisting of two rooms: a bedroom with bunk beds and a desk, and a cramped bathroom.  The walls were made of metal, and it was lit up by some white LED’s we’d installed.  

I walked to the sink and pulled out my contacts, setting them in their electrical solution to recharge.  The world immediately grew less vivid and detailed.  Not blurry, just more real.  Contacts used information they gathered to tell you information that wasn’t visible to the naked eye.  They also gave me access to communication, and information on my surroundings.  But after a day of being bombarded by the information, I needed a break. 

Once my contacts were in place in the solution, I pulled out a rag and rubbed my eyes, trying to clear them of the electro-fluid that protected and powered my contacts. 

Anna was laying on her bottom bunk, her feet waving in the air while staring at her phone.  The wall beside her was plastered with stickers of sea creatures.  A huge Megalodon was stuck on the wall next to her pillow.  

She was 8 years old.  Our parent’s accident had been almost a year and a half back, and she finally seemed happy again.  I looked around at the apartment we lived in.  It was small, sure.  But it was comfortable, climate controlled, and above all, safe from the Reavers.  It would be worth millions on the black market, and here the Couriers were just letting us stay here at no cost.

I sighed and rubbed my forehead.  I already knew that there was no such thing as a free lunch.  At some point, I’d pay the price.  When the time came, I’d become a Courier, and have to take their contracts.  The Couriers were the premiere black market “service” provider in Pittsburgh, and working against Raikage Incorporated was dangerous at best.  

Anna hummed to herself as she tapped away at her game.  I’d do whatever it took to keep her here, safe.  I’d do what the Couriers wanted.    

A knock came from the door, and I jumped at the noise.  I checked the viewscreen and saw Juno standing in front of it, dripping wet.  I pulled it open and let her in.  

“Juno!” Anna said. “Did you bring me anything?”  

“Don’t I always?,” Juno said.  She reached into a pocket and pulled out a stuffed animal shark.  

Anna shrieked in joy and ran at her, giving Juno a hug and taking the toy.  “Thank you thank you thank you!”

 Juno’s normally stoic expression broke into an actual grin.  I stared at it in amazement.  

She looked over at me and nodded her head back out in the hall.  “C’mon kid, we’ve got a package we need to pick up for tomorrow.”  Her eyes watched mine.  “You took out your contacts.  They’re designed to only need recharging once a week.  Why?”

I stared at the ground.  “They’re too much sometimes.  And they make me feel like I’m a kid playing the part of a Courier.  That I should be ready to die at any moment for the cause.”  I grimaced, knowing how bad that sounded.  “But I know that’s what I’m working towards.  Should I put them back in?”  

Juno stared at me, nodding to herself. “You should get in the habit of only taking them out for recharge, but I’m not planning on going far.  It’ll be good training for if you lose them.”  

“I’ll be back in a minute,” I said to Anna.  

Anna nodded and jumped onto her bed, still playing with the shark.

Juno and I made our way out of the bunker and out into the night.  The rain still came down in sheets, but the street was lit up by the flashing advertisements that flew overhead.  The night was alive with light and sound, though none of it came from people.  We walked through the industrial district, making ourselves as inconspicuous as possible.  

“We’re meeting with an old friend of mine,” Juno said.  “He’s worked inside Raikage Incorporated for something like 25 years, but he hates them just as much as we do.  He requested a meeting with me an hour ago.”  

Juno led us into an abandoned factory, and held a door open for me.  I walked inside, feeling the familiar anxiety that alway came before a meeting with clients or other Couriers.  

A man stood inside facing away from the door.  He wore a trench coat, and stood with a hand behind his back.  

“Dionysus,” Juno said.  “It’s good to see you again.”

Dionysus turned around.  The left half of his face was composed entirely of robotic parts.  I spotted an artificial eye and ear, and shivered involuntarily.  

“I wish I could say the same my dear,” he said, speaking with a synthesizer.  “I’m afraid they found me out.”  

Juno jumped back when she saw his face, and I saw her hand casually reach down towards the stunner she kept inside her jacket.

“You’d be dead if they found you out,” she said.  “What do you want?”

The left side of his face twitched in a spasm.  “I want nothing but to die, but that peace has been taken from me.”  Moving faster than my contactless eye could track, he lifted his arm and fired towards us, hitting Juno in the lower leg.  

Juno fell to the ground with a scream of pain.  Dionysus’ arm hissed steam, then closed.  He aimed it towards her again, but his face twisted in agony.  “I’m sorry!” he called out.  “I can’t control what I’m…”

He was hit in the head by Juno’s stunner.  It knocked him to the floor where he lay twitching violently.  

Juno cursed from where she lay on the ground.  “Leo!” she called out.  

I ran up to her.  The blast from Dionysus had done some serious damage to her left calf, and blood dripped from the wound, soaking into the factory floor.  I knelt down and started to put pressure when Juno hit me on the head with her stunner.  

“No you moron, take this and go shoot him a dozen times.  It’s set to kill.”

She shoved it into my hands and applied pressure to her own leg.  I looked down at the stunner in my hand.  It was my first time holding a gun.  

“Now you moron,” she said.  “That hit won’t keep him down forever.”

The old Leo who ate with his family might’ve been sick with the situation.  The old Leo who played chess with his father might’ve cried, or begged for another way.  I on the other hand, felt nothing.  I walked over to the still twitching body of the man and fired at his head and arm until they were unrecognizable.  

I walked back to Juno and helped her tie up her leg.  She looked over at Dionysus and spat on the ground.  “Poor fool,” she said. “He fought against it till the end.  His type don’t just ‘miss’ and accidentally hit a person’s leg.”  

I went to hand her the stunner, but she pushed it away.  “Keep it.  My leg is stable, but you need to run back to the hideout and bring people to help carry me there.”

I nodded, stuffed the gun into my back waistband, and headed out into the rain.  I moved quickly, and after a few minutes turned the corner that lead towards the hideout.  I was so preoccupied with getting there that I hadn’t noticed the buzzing.  

Four reavers sat on top of the alleyway, hacking at metal and concrete with their arms.  They reached their tentacles down into the bunker and ripped out Couriers one by one, shoving them into the holding bays through where a squid’s mouth would be.  I held my hand over my mouth and ducked back around the corner.  

Then I heard the sound I’d been dreading.  A young girl’s shriek of fear.  I looked back around the corner and saw Anna lifted by a claw and stuffed into a hold.  She was holding a stuffed shark in her arms.  

A long minute passed as one of the Reavers stuffed its arm inside the hideout, rooting around the bunker.  It finally retracted, and the four Reavers flew off into the night.  They’d be heading out of the city, I didn’t know where.  No one knew where they took the “relocated” people.  I walked up to the hideout then looked up to watch their lights disappear into the night sky.  I pulled out the stunner to fire at them, but they were already far out of range.  

On autopilot, I walked into the broken remains of the hideout.  The Reavers had made deep gouges in the steel of the hallways, and had torn the doors from their hinges.  I walked into what remained of my room, and saw the shattered and twisted metal of the desk and bed.  

The bathroom was relatively untouched however.   My contacts were still on the bathroom counter.  I picked them up, and walked outside.  The rain came down hard, thunderous and loud.  I slipped one contact on, then the other, and the night came alive with information and light.  

My tears mixed with the electro fluid, and I felt a fierce determination rise up in me.  I was going to find Anna, and if they had done *anything* to her, I was going to kill every member of Raikage Incorporated.

**Strands**

Connections.

In the academy we have a saying, ‘Everything Connected’. It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent on all of the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptic there is one connection that matters more than all the others, the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron then you can control the fate of man.

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way that a person strapped into an electrocutioner chair is. This microscopic lifeform has only one purpose, which is to carry an electrochemical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, the neuron will modify the strength or frequency of this signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They transmit a signal.  

These little fuckers come in all shapes and lengths, but the classic example is something closely resembling a tree. The branches being these cytoplasmic extensions termed dendrites, which receive chemical signal from adjoining nerves. This is translated into an electrical pulse which travels down to the cell body, known as the soma, then to the axon, a long conducting fiber which in our analogy would be the tree trunk. The axon then divides into terminal axons and these rootlike projections release neurotransmitters, thus propagating the signal onto the next neuron.

What does this have to do with my exodus from Earth? In one word, everything.

When I wake the next morning everything is unchanged. The old man is still bolted onto the wall across from me, still jacked in, a hesitant wallop of saliva contemplating a jump from his lips. Poor guy. This is what happens when your family can’t pony up enough money to put you in a decent virtual retirement home. Shoved into a place like this until you are ripe enough to slot into a tighter, slightly cheaper hole. I would hope the geezer's family at the very least could afford a decent simulation for him. Golfing or veranding with leftover friends. I switch the lights off on my way out. Close the door gently so as not to catch his cachectic fingers in the hinges. Poor guy.

Breakfast consists of vat grown eggs, scrambled with some homeboy hot sauce and a piece of soy pressed into the vague shape of bacon. Actually not bad. Little soggy. The frycook on the opposite side of the food cart gives me a hard look. Frowning at the blue light peeking through my shaggy bedhead. Which reminds me that before heading down to the dock I should cover up. I need a hat. 

I spend about an another hour wandering the streets, checking in niche shops and vendor stands but to no avail. No hats. The best I can find is this crumpled bandana at a thrift booth. A broad, off-white cloth with a black and red oriental pattern on the fringe. Makes me look like a confederate soldier with a bloody head concussion. Grungy, yet next-gen. Cliche yet comfortable in a way I just can’t seem to shake. 

I shrug. Whatever gets the job done. It will conceal my Synaptic Implant from hostile eyes at least. I pay the vendor and wrap the bandana over my head. Then I make for the docks.

As I approach the docks the streets open up again. Brief glimpses of sunlight penetrating through the industrial haze, casting long silhouettes on the sidewalk. Gradually then all at once, the street morphs amphibious. Detritus exchanging for fishmongers hawking chum, scurrying dock workers and the occasional wharf rat as big as a rottweiler. The piers are heavy with water rot, some already well on there way to sinking back into the deep. But I am just glad to have that pulpy smell of decaying wood in the air. It is so rare these days, wood. Even rotting, it smells unique. 

A surveillance drone hovers out of an alley on the left. These are Tri-blades, robotic beetle husks suspended by three overclocked rotary fins. Like a Freddy Krueger remake of the bumblebee. The Tri-blade hovers among the crowd, biometrically scanning for riff-raff. I tug my jacket collar higher, hoping I still fell below the probable cause threshold, as I hustled my ass down Pier Seven. Mitch is waiting for me there at the end of the pier.

“‘Milton. You’re late,” Mitch grunts.

“I guess.”

“What's that?” Meaning my bandana. 

“You said to get a hat.”

“Makes you look like a turd,” Mitch turns back to the ocean. “Don't be late again. In space everything is trying to kill you, and the only force stopping that is your shipmates. You say you tightened that airlock fastener and you didn't, we all get sucked into space. Do you hear me? In space your word is your bond.”

“Ok, relax, I got it. Won't happen again.”

Ahead of us is the ocean. Wide, mysterious and unbroken by the storms that had ravaged her coast last night. Grey waves metronomically thunking against the pier. In the distance, just against the horizon, I can see a thin vertical line. It is unsightly, meaning startling, and then soon lost to notice. Just another glitch or burnt out cathode ray on the celestial firmament. 

This is the Tsiolkovsky space elevator.

The thin line rises up from the ocean, stretching into the sky where it is joined by five other identical black lines, all converging in parallel, then lost in the stratosphere. As if some malevolent giant had suspended the Earth on marionette strings.

“Have you ever been up the elevator?” He asks me.

“No. No reason too. That's outside Hegemony jurisdiction. That’s Teether Six right?”

“Yup,” Mitch affirmed.

And they all feed up,” I traced the black lines as they climbed upward, “...to converge at the Low Earth Orbital station.”

“Yeah, but we will have to travel even farther, up to GEO. That’s where most ships dock. Including the Erebus.”

“It’ll take three days?”

“More or less,” Mitch motions to a barnicled fishing trawler that is moored nearby. “Fisherman who owns that boat says he can take us to the base of Teether Six for eighteen credits. 

“Sounds like a good deal,” I comment, eyeing another Tri-blade which has appeared on the other end of the pier and begun interrogating passersby. “What are we waiting for.”

“You mostly.”

I follow Mitch to the rickety boat, toss my duffle bag onto the unswabbed deck and climb aboard. After a coughing stutter the rusty engine pedals us out from the dock. The surveillance drone reaches the end of our pier moments later, watching our boat float away. I can almost imagine the faint sound of paparazzi snapshots on suspicious individual number 160217662. We sail out of the harbor.

“In other news world markets continue to reel from the Mardova cyberattack three days ago. An international manhunt still ongoing to locate the terrorist responsible. Authorities urge anyone with information to come forward immedia…”

Hearing footsteps, I tap my phone and the radio broadcast cuts silent. A second later, Mitch bangs the screen door to the cabin open, stomping onto the deck and bristling from shoulder to shoulder. 

“I just talked to the fisherman,” Mitch complains. “He said he changed his mind, now is insisting we pay him twenty five credits. For no good reason. I told him I am about to change my mind about tossing him overboard and taking his ship. He is thinking that part over.”

I shrug, “Lets not cause too much trouble here.”

The sea oscillates and writhes around our boat. We are just entering the trans-pacific garbage patch, refuge to the zombified containers and technocolor plastic wrappers of a civilization. A million tiny pieces of styrofoam and flotsam bobbing up and down, watching us trespass into their domain.

Mitch seems to quiet down a bit, leans against the railing beside me. Lights another cigarette.

“You don’t talk much do you?”

“Nope,” I reply.

“Why?”

“I’d prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.”

“Why’s that?”

“Because I am tired of having other people's thoughts in there.”

“What do you mean?”

“When I, when a Synaptic, cracks someone, we don’t just get inside their mind, they get inside ours. You hear there voices, see their memories, feel their emotions. And all the baggage that comes with it.” My left eye twitches. “Eventually, you learn to really value the time you have to yourself. Disconnected from everyone.”

“Fair enough. Is that why you're leaving? I’ve never heard of a Synaptic retiring. Didn’t know they could.”
“No. It’s not why I am leaving.”

“Hmmmm,” Mitch ashes into the sea. “What kind were you? Pre-crime? Discovery?”

“Reprogramming.”

Mitch winces. “Oh. Well shit...I had this uncle who was reading some stuff, resistance stuff, they took him for reprogramming so I know what kinda...” Then lost for words he glances at my banada. At my implant. “It still work?”

“For now.” Sooner or later someone was going to realize what I had done. Then that blue dot would turn red and I would never crack minds again. 

Arcing my neck I squint for another glimpse of the Tri-blade. But it is too far away to see now.  

Mitch flicks his cig into the ocean.

“I am going to go see if that fisherman came around yet, or if I have to mutiny his ass. 

Mitch leaves and I remain, watching Mitch's cig as it is lost among countless other pieces of floating sea trash. A seraph gull cries exhaustion high above me and I wonder what all this must have looked like when the ocean was still blue.

The next few hours slide away like memories. Sitting on that gently rocking wooden deck I watch cumulus smog the color of mustard. A squiggly floater threads across the corner of my vision. Like a lonely grey cobweb worming into my reality. That would be the first sign that my immune system is rejecting the transplant. Was hoping I had more time before this started.

I can also see the space elevator, getting closer now. What once was a violin string on the horizon is now thumb width and growing faster. I think about that it will be like, in space. To be free from the Synaptica  Corp. From the Hegemony's malignant grasp. To never have to hurt anyone. Ever again. 

The brain. That was where we left off. Your precious, unique and marvelous brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and the left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but, it is for all intents and purposes, an overrated computer. Afferent neurons carry sensory data from the universe into your central nervous system. This is input. The brain processes it through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons carry the output commands which your body is compelled to act upon. 

A connection machine.

Which is to say that you, are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you that there is more to this going on is selling you used snake oil. Now don't get me wrong, the elegance and intricacy of this connection machine rival any found in nature. But when you really dissect it down to the gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. Sad but true.

Eventually, we sail close enough that I can make out the space elevator. The elevator is massive, in that humbling, tower of babble kind of way. A black triple helix. Enormous. Colossal. Massive. I have no words to describe for how big this thing is. It is big. 

Mankind's greatest handicap to interstellar survival has always been that we were born inside a gravity well. As a result of this inconvenient truth, anything we want to send from Earth to space requires an immense energy cost. The solution is a cable that is forty seven kilometers long with one end anchored to the Earth and the other balanced by an orbiting counterweight. With such a rig in place one can simply walk to space, for a fraction of the energy cost. But there is one problem. In order to construct your stairway to heaven you need a material capable of resisting fifty mega Yuri, that is to say one million newtons per kilogram per meter. And it turns out there is only one element in the universe strong enough to hold things together like that. The same element holding you together. Carbon. Spun into flawless miles of nanotube filament.

There are things crawling up the side of Tsiolkovsky. Arachnoid machines with spindly appendages and solar powered exoskeletons. The machines inch along the helical backbone, swinging into the center every now and then in order to sap energy from a luminous shaft of green light that pulsed inside the elevator's core.

At the base of the space elevator lies Anchor Six, a floating platform that looks the ironworks hybrid of an oil platform and an industrial factory. Propellers with fan blades the size of cruise liners churn the pacific. Casually maneuvering Teether Six to avoid some piece of interstellar debris or asteroid far above the atmosphere. 

The fishing trawler pulls into the commercial port, jostling with all other manner of container vessels and passenger ships. Bee hives are less busy. After paying a disturbed and apologetic fisherman eighteen credits we disembark to join the crowds of tourists, laborers and military personnel on cattle march into the extraterrestrial processing center.

“What did you say to him?” I confront Mitch as soon as we are out of earshot of the fisherman.

“It’s not really so much what I said. But he got the message.”

“Maybe I didn’t make this clear before but, I really need to avoid raising any unneeded attention here.” 

Mitch gives an unapologetic nod. 

The inside of the extraterrestrial processing center has all the aesthetics of Aushwitz but soaked with a fresh coat of bureaucratic efficacy. A chain link and barbed wire labyrinth funneling humans lockstep from depot to depot. The nervous chatter of a hundred interrogated travelers lost under the booming of an overhead echovox. The first stop is of course the payment terminal. Please deposit two thousand credits to ascend Tsiolkovsky. That's a nice way to phrase it, half of these passengers won't make it through screening for one reason or another. You get stopped for some reason like unsatisfactory social ranking or the ethnic lottery and you'll never see that money again.

I pay the terminal the last remaining credits on my account. Two thousand even. Then that's it. No more money. Anything I eat, everywhere I sleep, I gotta earn it back. The terminal asks for my medical pass and then unlocks the turn style which I gladly rotate through to reach customs.

“Next!” 

“Any terrestrial lifeforms to declare?” 

“No.”

“Class C mechanical or bio-chemical augmentations?”

“No.”

“Forbidden literature or media.”

“No.”

I step onto a raised platform where three sets of halo scanners gyrate around at blurred speed. Backscatter X-rays, magnetic resonance and high frequency radio waves searching every crevice of my body for lies. But finding none I am allowed to move on.

The decontamination baths are scalding hot, pumped by the gallon full out of powerwash showers. You can really feel the chemicals tingling from your chin to your balls, exterminating any bacteria attempting to foolishly hitchhike your skin to Mars. Smells like bleach and ammonia. For privacy sake the standard video monitoring has been replaced by an enforcer who stands at motionless attention in the corner.  

“Well there is something you don't see everyday?” the security guard remarks, “where did you get the scars?”

My hands stay glued to my hair, where a bubbly mess of shampoo covers the blue glow of my Synaptica implant. I nod my head ever so slightly. From the corner of eyes I can see the metal bench where I left my bandana. Keeping my back turned at the enforcer I answer, “Manhattan Wastes.”

The guard camel-spits at my feet but the loogie is instantly washed away by the high pressure water jets. No one likes wastefolk. When the showers finish I quickly wrap my bandana around the blue diode under my scalp. Then before the enforcer can take a closer look at me I hustle to the next station.

They finish you off with an ultraviolet tanning bed. Meant to soap up any residual viruses. I read the miniature disclaimer above the purple fluorescent grill. About how the increased cancer risk of this UV treatment pales in comparison to the radiation exposure of deep space. Comforting. 

But all that's not even the worst part. The worst part is the disinfecting bowel regimen. I won't say much about that other then I really was leaving everything behind.

After what seems like an eternity, Mitch and I make it to the last station, extraterrestrial clearance. Through the chain linked fence I can see the garages that house the mechanical climbers. Just a couple more feet and I've made it. Mitch waits nearby as I approach the clearance booth.

“Genetic identification.” The clerk behind the booth drawls, motioning for me to put my wrist in a plebotometer hole underneath his desk. He's got this hooked nose he would just love to look down on you with and, although he is maybe three quaters my height, his perch is so high that he can.

“No genetic ID, Ecclesiasticis.” I say pulling out the inverted metal cross from under my wife beater. It was illegal for a machine to read the DNA of a member of the priesthood. Just about the worst sin imaginable for the Church of Sapien.

The clerk, smiles lackadaisically, “How nice,” then flips a switch next to him. “Name?”

“Father Milton. Of the twenty third Brothers of Absolution.”

A mechanical arm, sinuous and black as an eel, ominously lowers itself from the ceiling. The appendage ends in a device that resembles a gun barrel ringed by vice grip attachments. Without warning the thing lunged forward and, with suctioning force, attached itself to my eye by the vice grips. There were flashes of emerald and red as the mechanical arm reads my retina-print. Then satisfied I was who I said I was, it unclamped from my head and retracted back into the ceiling. 

“Hmmmm,” the clerk scrutinizes his terminal screen, then another fake smile “all clear. Enjoy your time off world Father Milton.”

We are sitting in garage bays waiting for our crawlers to be called up. Mitch is loudly chowing down on a pickle and killifish sandwich. His greasy hair keeps falling into the sandwich and he has to stop slobbering every now and then to pull it back. I am reading about the Mardova riots spreading like wildfire across Asia. I wonder what it must be like, for all those people. To suddenly wake from decades of sleep, to find out that a corporation had been using your body as soldier, prostitute or slave. Kept you locked in a comatose dream state all so that a fat cat could profit off the life that should have been yours to live. 

I hope they raze it all to the ground. 

“So you wanna tell me now,” Mitch says in between mouthfuls, “why you left?”

“I told you. Just want to see the stars and spend some time working away from it all. Salvage work seemed like as good a break as any.”

“Bullshit.”

“Pardon?”

“Bullshit. Everything you just told me is a lie. I'm not stupid, 'Father Milton’. Those are stolen eyes. So I got to ask the question what kind of cop impersonates a priest in order to ascend question free up the space elevator. The kind that has done something very bad and needs to get out of Dodge, very, very quick.”

Mitch huffs, “You know they won't last too long right? Your fancy new eyes. Outside Earth, without steroid and nanobot treatments, my friend you are looking at a week, maybe a month max before your immune system rejects those babies and you go blind. We will likely be out past Jupiter by then. Good luck finding mechanical augmentations anything like they have here.”

Holding an index finger against his left eye, “See this? Genulex ocular aug. Can see pan-spectrum with this. Cost me a fucking fortune. Out there past the belt, with all the hand-me-down outdated tech the colonies are using, be lucky if you could see a freight train coming your way. Now I told you to never lie to me and you did. So I am going to ask this next question only once and if you lie to me again I am going to break your legs and you can get up to space by yourself. What is your real name?”

“Cerpin,” I answer “Cerpin Vex.”

“And why are you going to space.”

I don’t know why I tell him. Maybe I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe I am growing to fond of the idiot. Maybe I am tired of the lies.

“A man. I am searching for a man. Doctor Richard Foster.”

“The man who invented AI?”

“Yes.”

“Well, Cerpin,” Mitch grins cheshire. “It’s nice to finally fucking meet you.”

by William Gibson

published in 'Rolling Stone' (June 15, 1989) 


THE BOY crouches beside a fence in Virginia, listening to Chubby Checker on the Rocket Radio. The fence is iron, very old, unpainted, its uprights shaved down by rain and the steady turning of seasons. The Rocket Radio is red plastic, fastened to the fence with an alligator clip. Chubby Checker sings into the boy's ear through a plastic plug. The wires that connect the plug and the clip to the Rocket Radio are the color his model kits call flesh. The rocket Radio is something he can hide in his palm. His mother says the Rocket Radio is a crystal radio: She says she remebers boys building them before you could buy them, to catch the signals spilling out of the sky. The Rocket radio requires no battery at all. Uses a quarter mile of neighbor's rusting fence for an antenna. Chubby Checker says do the twist. The boy with the Rocket Radio reads a lot of science fiction - very little of which will help to prepare him for the coming realities of the Net. He doesn't even know that Chubby Checker and the Rocket Radio are part of the Net. 

ONCE PERFECTED, communication technologies rarely die out entirely; rather, they shrink to fit particular niches in the global info-structure. Crystal radios have been proposed as a means of conveying optimal seedplanting times to isolated agrarian tribes. The mimeograph, one of many recent dinosaurs of the urban office place, still shines with undiminished samizdat potential in the century's backwaters, the late-Victorian answer to desk-top publishing. Banks in uncounted thrid-world villages still crank the day's totals on black Burroughs adding machines, spooling out yards of faint indigo figures on long, oddly festive curls of paper, while the Soviet Union, not yet sold on throwaway new-tech fun, has become the last reliable source of vacuum tubes. The eight-track-tape format survives in the truck stops of the Deep South, as a medium for country music and spoken-word pornography. The Street finds its own uses for things - uses the manufacturers never imagined. The microcassette recorder, originally intended for on-the-jump executive dictation, becomes the revolutionary medium of magnizdat, allowing the covert spread of suppressed political speeches in Poland and China. The beeper and the cellular telephone become tools in an increasingly competitive market in illicit drugs. Other technological artifacts unexpectedly become means of communication, either through opportunity or necessity. The aerosol can gives birth to the urban graffiti matrix. Soviet rockers press homemade flexi-discs out of used chest X-rays. 

THE KID WITH THE ROCKET RADIO gets older. One day he discovers sixty feet of wierdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in a roadside Omtario brush. This is toward the end of the Eight-Track Era. He deduces the existence of the new and exotic cassette formate: this semialien substance, jettisoned in frustration from the smooth hull of some hurtling Vette, settling like newtech angel hair. 

I BELONG TO A GENERATION of Americans who dimly recall the world prior to television. Many of us, I suspect, feel vaguely ashamed about this, as though the world before television were no quite, well, the world. The world before television equates with the world before the Net - the mass culture and the mechanisms of Information. And we are of the Net; to recall another mode of being is to admit to having once been something other than human. The Net, in our lifetime, has propagated itself with viral rapidity, and continues to do so. In Japan, where so many of the Net's components are developed and manufactured, this frantic evolution of form has been embraced with unequaled enthusiasm. Akihabara, Tokyo's vast retail electronics market, vibrates with a constant hum of biz in a city where antiquated three-year-old Trinitrons regularly find their way into landfill. But even in Tokyo one finds a reassuring degree of Net-induced transitional anxiety, as I learned when I met Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of Akira, a vastly popular multivolume graphic novel. Neither of us spoke the other's language: Our mutual publisher had supplied a translator, and our ""conversation"" was relentlessly documented. But Otomo and I were still able to share a moment of universal techno-angst. 

His living room was dominated by a vast matte-black media node that would put most Hollywood producers to shame. He pointed to an eight-inch stak of remote-control devices. 
""I don't know how to use them,"" he said, ""but my children do."" 
""I don't know how to use mine, either."" 
Otomo laughted. 
Today, Otomo's collection of remotes is probably part of some artfully bulldozed gomi plain, landfill for Neo-Tokyo. Gomi: Japanese for ""garbage,"" a lot of which consists of outmoded consumer electronics - such as those recently redundant remotes. Wisely assuming a constant source, the Japanese build themselves more island out of it. 

The sexiness of newness, and how it wears thin. The metaphysics of consumer desire, in these final years of the twentieth century... 

Two years ago I was finally shamed into acquiring a decent audio system. A friend had turned up in the new guise of high-end-audio importer, and my old ""system,"" so to speak, caused him actual pain. He offered to go wholesale on a total package, provided I let him select the bits and pieces. 
I did. 
It sounds fine. 
But I'm not sure I really enjoy the music any more than I did before, on certifiably low-fi junk. The music, when it's really there, is just there. You can hear it coming out of the dented speaker grill of a Datsun B-210 with holes in the floor. Sometimes that's the best way to hear it. I knew a man once whose teen years had been L.A., jazz, the Forties. He spoke of afternoons he'd spent, utterly transported, playing 78-rpm recordings, ""worn down white"" with repeated applications of a sharp steel stylus. That is, the shellac that carried the grooves on these originaly black records was plain gone: What he must have been listening to could only have been the faintest approximations of the original sound. (Rationing affected steel phonograph needles, he told me; desperate hipsters resorted to the spikes of the larger cactuses.) 
That man heard that music. 
I first heard the Rolling Stones on a battery-powered, basketball-shaped, pig-skin-covered miniature phonograph of French manufacture - a piece of low tech as radical in its day as it is now obscure. Radical in that it enabled the teenage owner to transport LP records and the intoxicant of choice to suitably private locations - the boonies. 

This constituted an entirely new way to listen to the music of choice. Choice being the key word. The revolutionary potential of the D-cell record player wasn't substanially bettered until the advent of the Walkman, which allows us to integrate the music of choice with virtually any landscape.
The Walkman changed the way we understand cities. 
I first heard Joy Division on a Walkman, and I remain unable to separate the experience of the music's bleak majesty from the first heady discovery of the pleasures of musically encapsulated fast forward urban motion. 
In the Seventies the Net writhed with growth. Gaps began to close. A paradox became increasingly evident: While artists needed the Net in order to reach a mass audience, it seemed to be the gaps through which the best art emerged, at least initially. I am, by trade, a science-fiction writer. That is, the fiction I've written so far has arrived at the point of consuption via a marketing mechansim called ""science fiction."" During the past twenty years the Net has closed around mass-market publishing - and science fiction - as smoothly as it closed around the music industry and everything else. As a science-fiction writer, I'm sometimes asked whether or not I think the Net is a good thing. That's like being asked if being human is a good thing. As for being human being a good thing or not, I can't say - this has been referred to as the Postmodern Condition. 
In any case it sometimes looks to me as though lots of us will eventually have a basis for comparison, by virtue of no longer being quite human at all, thank you.
Meanwhile, in my front room, the family media node is in metastasis, sprouting CD's, joysticks, you name it. My kids, like Mr. Otomo's, cluster like flies. 
The other thing they ask you when you're a science-fiction writer is ""What do you think will happen?"" The day I reply with anything other than a qualified ""I haven't got a clue,"" please shoot me. While science fiction is sometimes good at predicting things, it's seldom good at predicting what those things might actually do to us. For example, television, staple window dressing for hundreds of stores from the Twenties through the Forties, was usually presented as a mode of personal communication. Nobody predicted commercials, Hollywood Squares or heavy-metal music videos. 
With that disclaimer firmly in place, I predict the family media node growing into a trickier and more unified lump. The distinction between television, CD player and computer seems particularly arbitrary these days, a tired scam designed to support the robots who solder circuit boards. But as to what your integrated Net Node will actually be able to do for you one day, my best bet is that the words for it haven't been invented yet. 
Example. A BBC executive working on one of another vision of ""interactive television"" offered me a tour of a small research facility in San Francisco. He was interested in having me ""do"" something with this new technology: The lab we visited was devoted to ...well, there wern't verbs. I looked at things, watched consoles as they were poked and prodded, and nobody there, it seemed, could even begin to explain what it was I might be doing if I were to, uh, do one of these projects, whatever it was. It wasn't writing, and it wasn't directing. It was definitely something, though, and they were certainly keen to do it, but they needed those verbs. 
Another example. A week later I found myself in an FX compound situated off a quiet back street in North Hollywood, experiencing serious future-shock frissom. My hosts - young, fast and scientific to the bone - had developed a realtime video puppet, a slack-faced Max Headroom suspended in the imaginary space behind a television screen. Invited to put my hand in a waldo that looked vaguely like a gyroscope, I caused this sleeping golem to twitch and shiver, and my own hair to stand on end. On the way out, I was given a tape of the thing being manipulated by a professional movie puppeteer. It looks a lot more natural than I ever do on television, but what are the verbs for what those young fast fellows were doing? 
We hurtle toward an imaginary vortex, the century's end... 

HE GETS UP in the morning and watches ten minutes of MuchMusic while the water boils for coffee. The kids aren't up yet because it's not quite time for Dinosaurs. MuchMusic is Canada's approximation of MTV. In the morning he usually watches it with the sound off, unless they show a video from Quebec, in which case he listens because he doesn't understand French. 
Because he doesn't like the Net to gnaw at the remnants of the nights dreams. Not until he's ready for it to anyway.

"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

***Locations***


**Neo Shanghai:**
Megacity where our story begins. Along with her sister cities Beijing and Hong Kong, Neo Shanghai represents the peak of Pan China civilization. From the Golden Temple, the Faceless Emperor watches over mankind’s recovery. The ruling and priestly classes reside in the luxurious Skyview, a spine of needlepoint high rises. The mover shakers of the Financial District trade cash and commodities from the Trans-African Republic to the United Pacific Nations. To them the world consists of two things money and ways to get money (and other people fall in the latter). The advanced robotics conglomerate known ubiquitously as  “The Corporation” produces most of technology used by the people of Pan China. Their specialties includes quantum computation, cybernetics and advanced android systems.

Descending from the upper levels we pass the Boxes. A crisscrossing layer of bridges, platforms, squares, roadways, commerce, and residential sectors. In the cavernous spaces below the Boxes reside the massive factories, power plants and biovat farms which supply the Neo Shanghai with necessities. Still further down we have the Pits, kilometer deep borehole tunnels infested by the cites poor, villainous and lost souls.

The docks of Neo Shanghai are a major throughway for world commerce with any number of vessels entering her port daily. Off shore to the east is a Pacific archipelago known as “Wayfarer Island”. This is the launch site for the Pan China. It is presumed to be the most advanced space program left in existence and the only known way of reaching various orbital space stations and the lunar colony. 

Past the encompassing barrier wall of Neo Shanghai is the vast desert known as Outland. This is nuclear wasteland left behind from the third world war. The only people who would dare traverse these barrens are nomadic refugees and the raiders that prey on them.

"[Essay] What is Cyberpunk?\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.

&#x200B;

[One of the classics of the genre.](https://preview.redd.it/rnd5284piw4a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20a7841441baf13c7eeaab29c500b77e162b193d)

WHAT IS CYBERPUNK?

By. C.T. Phipps

Link: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)

When embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.

I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.

Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \*\*\*\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.



The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Blade Runner. Blade Runner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where the majority of work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). The majority of people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggarauts which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson’s works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the mportance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about.

A lot of fans of the genre love the tropes without actually caring about the meaning. Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trenchcoats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society.

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishsized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity’s problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.

I’ve mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may actually achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter.

Some cyberpunk works actually allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it’s not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Deckard, the protagonist of Blade Runner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet.

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the most deft of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop’s Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world–forcing them to rebel because society won’t allow them to be good.

The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.

Paul Verhoven’s Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit’s population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than “normal” criminals could ever hope to match.

OCP’s not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they’re actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science- fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.

While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class–so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality.

The Watch Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia.

So what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them."
"The Last Crusade: Religious War on Artificial IntelligenceOften times I have noticed in debates on what the rights of advanced A.I. should be that there is a always a segment of people who fervently believe they A.I. should have zero rights and not be treated as equal to people. When I casually investigate their histories I find they are almost always very religious people who champion such positions such as A.I. never being capable of sentient/sapient thought.

If humanity develops advanced Artificial Intelligence then I ask you how do you think those who are very religious will act towards it? What do you predict will happen with A.I. in relation to the staunchly religious? Thoughts in general about the topic?

"Study on perceptions of human and robot behaviors, $150 Amazon card drawing [mod approved]Greetings! 

I’m a professor at West Virginia University, and I’m conducting a research study on peoples’ perceptions of how humans and robots behave. Considering the role of machines in cyberpunk lit, I thought this group might be interested, so I’m posting to invite you to participate in this study. It takes ~20 minutes to complete by taking an online survey. 

In this survey, you’ll be asked to view or listen to a series of situations involve a robot or a human, and to give us your opinion on those situations. It is recommended that you **complete this survey on a laptop or desktop computer** rather than a phone or tablet, because you will be asked to stream some short audio/video and it will be easier to type out your responses. You should also use a device that has **audio and video capabilities** since you’ll be asked to listen to some short sound clips. 

Everyone who participates can opt into a random drawing for a $150 Amazon gift card. If you choose to opt into the drawing, you will be asked to enter your email address so you can be notified if you’re drawn as the winner. Your email will be kept completely confidential and will be deleted after the drawing is complete. The odds of winning the gift card depend on the number of participants. Please note that the incentive will only be delivered via a U.S. Amazon card, and you must be at least 18 years of age to participate.

"Full Service Evictions part 2 (short story)Raymond idly flipped through channels on the TV. There wasn't much on at this hour; the movie channels had the usual assortment of bland, cookie-cutter blockbusters, but the rest were showing reruns of old sitcoms, or talk shows of little interest. A few had already switched to infomercials; that usually didn't happen for another hour, but was increasingly common these days. He winced as one channel played an especially loud advertisement; flipping past it quickly, he stole a look at the hallway, hoping that the noise hadn't awakened his lady.

He settled on an old crime drama from the 1970s. The on-screen guide told him it was a made-for-TV movie. He smiled, popped open a generic-brand 40 ounce malt liquor, and settled in for the kitschy low-grade noir. It seemed like a perfect way to kill the next two hours. Not quite enough to make it to daylight, but close.

From within the walls came scurrying noises; one went straight up and then across the ceiling, between floors. He shivered as he thought of the rats that infested this building. There seemed to be less of them lately, but it was difficult to focus on that when one of them was literally overhead. He tried to hold back his disgust.

Raymond heard shuffling noises coming from the hallway; he didn't turn to see who it was. The on-screen action showed the toughs chasing a lone police officer, panting and wide-eyed with terror. He watched with glazed eyes, not wanting to miss a moment.

""Are you *ever* coming to bed, Raymond?"" The shrill harping could only come from one person.

""Get off my case, Clara,"" he retorted. ""It's not like I have to get up early tomorrow.""

""Yeah...tomorrow, or any *other* day,"" she huffed. ""Did you even *work* tonight?""

""I got done *early*!"" he snapped. ""It was just a quick courier job. No hassles. Everything went smooth as a peach.""

Clara moved in front of the TV, just as the bruisers caught up with the hapless cop. ""More hustles with your hoodlum friends? Are you *ever* going to get a real job, like you promised?""

Raymond bobbed and weaved, trying to regain line-of-sight with the victorious goons. ""Damn it, you're blocking my view! Get the hell out of the way!""

Defiantly, she switched off the TV and stood there, her gaze like icy daggers. Glowering, he clicked the remote to turn it back on. Nothing happened; she was blocking the sensor. Clara smirked as she returned his angry stare.

""You bitch!"" he shouted. ""You made my miss my favorite part!""

Clara clucked her tongue. ""Well, isn't *that* too bad. You already missed the good parts of your son's childhood. I don't hear you whining about *that*!""

Raymond threw his hands up in the air. ""You *wanted* me to come back, after all these years, to try to help you raise him! And here I am! I bring in money when I can, and I keep quiet about living here so you can continue to collect your child assistance! What does it take to make you happy?""

Clara stabbed her finger in his direction. ""How about serving as a better *role model*? I almost had him going to school regularly until *you* showed up. Now he's out on the streets, acting like *you*! The extra money you bring in isn't worth the bad influence!""

Raymond pointed past her, to the TV. ""It got you this fancy cable-TV package, didn't it? You know you watch it as much as I do.""

""Stop changing the subject!"" Clara raged. ""Do you even *know* where your son is right now? How can you raise him if he isn't even *here*? He's out on the streets *right now*, following in your disgraceful footsteps!""

""So what do you want me to do?"" Raymond snorted. ""Leave?""

""Oh, isn't that just *typical*!"" Clara exploded. ""You're gone for years and years, then one day you show up out of nowhere, promising you've changed and that you'll make up for time lost, but once you run into the slightest bit of static, you want to leave again! You're a worthless excuse for a man.""

Raymond didn't reply. He just stared at the ground.

""Why did you *really* come back?"" she accused. ""Did you just need a place to crash?"" Raymond looked up at her suddenly, a sheepish look in his eyes.

Clara gaped. ""Really? That's *it*? You're only here for what *you* can get out of it? All your promises were just *empty*?""

Raymond looked towards the hallway. ""Look at me when I'm talking to you!"" Clara steamed.

""Good job,"" Raymond chided. ""You've woken her up.""

From behind the door jamb, a pair of wide eyes peered fearfully into the living room. As Clara turned to look, they disappeared back into the hallway.

""Muriel?"" Clara cooed. ""Just go back to bed, sweetie.""

Muriel appeared again. ""I can't sleep.""

Raymond gestured angrily. ""See what you did? *I* was being quiet until *you* showed up.""

""Don't *even* start with me!"" Clara turned toward Muriel. ""Why can't you sleep, baby?""

Muriel paused, her eyes fluttering shyly. ""I smell smoke.""

Raymond and Clara looked around nervously, sniffing the air. ""Hey, I think I smell it too,"" Raymond noted.

The building's fire alarm abruptly started to blare. Clara strode towards her bedroom. ""Muriel, honey? Get your jacket and shoes and follow me outside!"" She turned to look at Raymond, but he had already bounded out the window onto the fire escape. She sighed heavily and disappeared inside her room.

Outside, the tenants gaped as smoke drifted out of the open windows and through the seams of the building's failed weatherproofing. Clara and Muriel walked around from the side of the building, sniffling and coughing lightly. They came to a stop a safe distance away, on the sidewalk opposite their tenement, surrounded by neighbors and curious onlookers. Clara swept her eyes over the crowd for Raymond; he was nowhere to be found. Clara scowled angrily.

""That smoke smelled funny, momma,"" Muriel piped up.

""What are you talking about?"" Clara replied dismissively. ""It's smoke. It all smells the same.""

""No, momma,"" Muriel challenged, clinging to her mother's gown. ""It smelled...waxy.""

A nearby kid turned to Muriel. ""Yeah, I noticed that too,"" he concurred. ""Like the kind they have at magic shows. What does it mean?""

A distant din of sirens slowly approached. The crowd watched a convoy of trucks arrive; they looked like police vans, though they didn't bear any government insignia. As they stopped, several people in dark-colored guard uniforms emerged; there were both men and women, though all of them were stoutly built. One of them was taller and thinner; he wore a suit, and observed the action from a distance.

Instead of checking on the tenants, the guards surrounded the building, forming a perimeter. Clara could barely make out a dim emblem on the nearest van, seemingly dark-gray on a black background, consisting of stylized renditions of the letters ""U"" and ""P"". She heard one of them remark on their cell phone that all entrances and exits had been successfully barricaded.

A group of security officers, wearing gas masks, ran inside the building. Another addressed the crowd. ""Remain calm, everyone,"" he assured. ""The smoke will be fixed in just a few moments.""

More sirens converged on the area; before long, a squad of police vans had arrived. Other than their prominent government logos, they looked identical to the vans that arrived before. They parked across the street on both ends, forming a barrier. The officers quickly disembarked and stood in a barricade in front of their vehicles, joined by several of the security personnel. An uneasy murmur emerged from the crowd of tenants, and many of the passersby quickly tried to leave the scene.

Clara noticed that the smoke had thinned out considerably. She also saw that more windows had been opened up. Some were at the ends of hallways, but many more were from the inside of people's apartments, windows that didn't lead to fire escapes. Apparently, they had entered the apartments! She raised her hand to object, but quickly withdrew it, and just watched sadly.

The kid that had been standing near Muriel marched confidently up to the waiting police officers. ""What's going on?"" he demanded. ""When is the fire department going to show up?""

""They're not,"" the officer shot back, haughtily. ""The smoke was just to get all of you out of the building."" The crowd's grumbling became more incensed. ""But it's two-thirty in the morning!"" the kid pouted. ""That's all right,"" the officer scolded. ""Most of you were still awake."" The kid's eyes dropped; he stared morosely at the ground. ""What's going on?""

The officer flashed a surly smile. ""You're about to find out.""

A security guard with a bullhorn spoke. ""OK, listen up, people,"" he barked. ""Those of you who are behind on your rent...consider yourself evicted. Those of you who are meeting your obligations...you can go back inside. And anyone with an active warrant for his or her arrest..."" Clara noted with alarm that the police officers had drawn their weapons; a few had tear-gas cannons mounted to the top of their shotguns. The overdriven voice on the bullhorn continued. ""...will be going away with these fine officers."" The speaker stopped a moment to sneer. ""And you may as well go quietly...there's no sense in adding 'resisting arrest' to your charges.""

A panicked din arose from the crowd. ""Now, if you don't know which you are,"" the voice blared, ""form a line in front of the building's entrance.""

Clara swallowed hard, grabbed Muriel's hand, and slowly walked forward. A throng of her neighbors meandered in the same direction, joining one of multiple lines. Clara noticed uneasily that a number of the residents, and a few of the passersby, had simply lied down on the ground and put their hands behind their heads. It unsettled her to realize how familiar they were with the procedure for being arrested.

For the first time, she noticed a new group of people had arrived, wearing navy-blue jumpsuits and carrying a variety of packing supplies. They were followed by large spider-legged robots, with platforms where their heads should be, loaded up with collapsed paper boxes. All of them disappeared into the front door. She wondered if anyone else had noticed them; no one seemed to react to their presence, as if giant spider-robots were somehow an everyday occurrence.

The line moved slowly. Most people were simply sent aside, to wait inside the unmarked vans. A few were taken away by the police. Not once did she see anyone allowed back inside. She heard part of the discussion involving the resident in front of her. ""But what about all my stuff?"" the obese man protested. ""It'll be packed up and stored, and treated as collateral, until you make good on your debts,"" came the gruff reply. ""But I can't afford that!"" the fat man pouted. ""Then it'll probably end up in a thrift store,"" the guard snarled. ""Now go sit in the van, if you want a place to sleep for the night."" The portly fellow, looking chastened, slowly lumbered toward the waiting van.

Clara and Muriel were now at the front of the line. ""Hold still,"" she was ordered, as a security guard held up a tablet to her. A few seconds later, her name and photo splashed across the screen. ""Is this you?"" demanded the guard. ""Yes,"" she replied meekly.

The guard studied the screen for a few moments, her long blonde hair packed tightly into her cap. ""You recently caught up with your past-due rent, but we have evidence you've got an unapproved roommate."" The guard showed her the screen; there was a photo of Raymond, but with a different last name than she knew him to have. ""Yes,"" she mumbled. The guard pressed a few buttons on the screen, then turned it towards her again. A video showed Raymond inhaling some sort of white powder up his nose. ""We recorded this video a few hours ago. We have several more just like it, stretching back a few months.""

Clara's face fell. ""How did you get those videos? Where were the cameras?""

""They're mobile,"" the guard explained. ""The droids in your walls have extensive sensor packages. You probably heard them scurrying at all hours of the day.""

Clara looked alarmed. ""I thought those were rats!""

The guard appeared unmoved. ""They were, at first. The droids have been killing the vermin, patching up a lot of holes, making other interior repairs, and recording evidence on the tenants.""

The guard looked more closely at her screen. ""Your son Julio lives with you, right? Where is *he*?"" Clara looked down disconsolately. ""I don't know. Out with his friends, somewhere."" The guard shrugged. ""It's just as well. We've amassed a pretty big dossier on him, too. Lots of petty theft."" She played a series of videos for Clara, showing Julio hiding his ill-gotten gains in his bedroom. ""If he were here right now, he wouldn't be going with you — he'd be leaving with the police.""

Clara suddenly became aware of strident caterwauling, coming from behind the police vans. ""Don't you *dare* stand in my way!"" came the cry. ""I'm your boss! I pay your salaries! Now *move it*!"" Emerging from behind the perimeter was a smartly-dressed woman with a ruffled collar and a fierce gaze. She marched straight up to the guard interrogating Clara, trailed by two police officers serving as her security detail. ""And just what the *hell* is going on here?"" She thrust her open wallet into the guard's face.

""You don't need to show me your I.D."", the guard chided. ""I recognize you from the news. You've certainly made a name for yourself lately, councilwoman Karen. Now, how can I help you?""

""You can start by letting these people back into their homes!"" she demanded.

""I'm afraid that's impossible, councilwoman,"" the guard demurred. ""They're all being evicted for cause.""

""But they have *rights*!"" she protested. ""There are *court* hearings for this kind of thing! And while the details are being sorted out, they can continue to live here!"" As she spoke, a few of the police officers ambled towards her. The others remained behind to secure the perimeter and to keep an eye on the arrestees in the vans.

""They've already vacated the premises, and their belongings are being packed,"" the guard countered. ""At this point, the eviction is simply a fact.""

""The *hell* it is!"" councilwoman Karen blubbered. ""How dare you talk to me like that! I can have you arrested *right now*!"" He turned back to the police and stared hotly at them. ""Did you hear me? Arrest them *this instant*!""

The nearest police officer smiled. ""Hi, Sandra; how have you been?"" The guard returned his smile. ""Hi, Charles! Not too bad, considering. I was worried after our department got defunded and I lost my job, but I got picked up by this new outfit pretty quickly. They were only too happy to hire highly-trained law-enforcement personnel! I think most of us ended up here.""

Charles looked around. ""Yeah, I recognize a lot of faces. Glad to see you all bounced back!""

""What are you *doing*?"" the councilwoman demanded. ""I said arrest them this *instant*!""

Charles shook his head. ""I'm not about to do that to an old co-worker. She may not be with the police any more, but that wasn't by choice, and it's obvious she's still one of the few holding civil society together."" He swept his arm over the rest of the security guards. ""And that goes for them too!""

""Don't you *dare* defy me!"" the councilwoman screeched. ""I'll have your badges for this!""

Charles coolly ignored her. ""By the way, Sandra...are there any more openings at your firm?""

""Plenty!"" Sandra gushed. ""They need a lot more trained law-enforcement officers for what *they* have planned. They'll probably pick you up in no time flat!"" She looked at the police officers crowding around. ""And I'm sure that goes for the *rest* of you, too!""

""That sounds great,"" interjected one of the officers in the councilwoman's security detail. ""We're getting mighty tired of taking her abuse,"" he added, pointing at Karen.

""So what do you say, councilwoman Karen?"" challenged Officer Charles, as Karen gaped. ""Do you want to defund the *rest* of us, right *now*? A writ of authority from the government is less important to me than doing the right thing, which these people clearly are.""

""I...er..."" Karen stammered. Charles continued. ""And don't bother threatening us with the courts. You *know* how backed up they are. They wouldn't even get to this for a few months."" He leaned in more closely. ""Keep in mind...the city council can't even stop the wave of crime on the streets. What do you think your chances are of stopping a supposedly rogue police agency run by a private company? Ultimately, that's just another crime wave that you can do nothing about.""

Councilwoman Karen moped forlornly. ""We'll all have our day in court...as soon as possible."" She straightened herself, and tried to put on a brave face. ""I think we're done here."" She turned to march away. Her security detail smirked at her behind her back as they followed.

Security guard Sandra, staring levelly at Karen's retreating form, muttered under her breath. ""You have *no* idea how right you are.""

She resumed addressing Clara. ""So...we found Raymond's drug stash while we were packing up. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to learn that you qualify to be evicted.""

Muriel cried and clutched her mom tightly; tears formed in Clara's eyes. ""What must I do to get my stuff back?""

""A few things,"" the guard commanded. ""You need to find a new place to live, we need to make sure you don't have any other outstanding debts, and given what we found, you need to pass a drug test."" She eyed Clara warily. ""Do you think you will?""

""Yes!"" Clara asserted. ""I don't do drugs. I didn't even know *he* was doing them.""

The guard smiled; her eyes beamed with sympathy. ""Then this will probably all be over soon! We'll put you and your daughter up for the night; don't worry, it won't be expensive. We know you can't afford much. Tomorrow, we'll get this straightened out, and you can get on with your lives.""

""We can't get our old apartment back?""

Sandra gazed at Clara levelly. ""You couldn't afford your old apartment, not without Raymond's money. And we have no record of him being employed. So he was probably getting paid under the table. We'll be dealing with him separately. For now...if you two get in the van, we'll take you to a place you can sleep for tonight."" Clara nodded, and she and Muriel slowly made their way to the waiting wagons.

As the guards continued to sort the tenants, officer Charles walked up to the man in the suit. ""I take it you're in charge of this operation?""

""Indeed,"" replied the man. ""My name is Jason. How can I help you, officer?""

""So, funny story,"" began Charles. ""We don't actually have space in our jails for all these people. Is there anything you can do to help?""

""Indeed!"" beamed Jason. ""Let me make the arrangements.""

Clara nervously watched a security guard approach the van. He smiled as he caught her eye. ""OK, people,"" he began. ""Tonight, you'll be taken to a spare dormitory at the local college. The families with children will get first pick of the private rooms; the rest of you may end up in bunks. If you cooperate with us, you may be allowed to live there for the time being. You'll have to share facilities with others, and keep them clean, and in any case, it's better than being homeless.""

""Will we be safe?"" Clara clutched Muriel tightly.

""Not to worry, ma'am,"" the guard assured. ""Anyone truly dangerous has already been filtered out. And the whole place is under A.I.-driven surveillance, 24 hours a day. If anything bad happens, it'll get stopped pretty quickly.""

""Is that legal?"" The obese man Clara had seen earlier looked incredulous.

""You'll have to consent to it, as part of the terms and conditions for staying there.""

""What if I don't *want* to? You can't *make* us do that!"" The obese man was defiant.

""You're free to take your chances on the street,"" the guard offered, pointing away. ""Though I must say, that alley doesn't look very inviting. What kind of hotel room can you afford right now?""

The portly guy looked crestfallen. ""Fine...I accept.""

""Why does the college have a spare dormitory?"" a young man asked.

The guard demurred. ""It's not really my place to speak for them, but it's my understanding that parents don't want to pay for education when their kids never seem to be in class, opting to join protests and the like. So they're having trouble retaining students."" He smirked before continuing. ""Also, college is so expensive these days, students have begun taking their first few years of undergraduate classes at community colleges or trade schools. Only then do they find a college that'll let them transfer their credits. The place you're going tonight is one of the colleges that *doesn't* allow that. So they're hurting pretty badly."" The guard shrugged. ""I mean, it works out well for *you*, and for the firm, so I'm not going to complain.""

""What firm?"" a middle-aged lady asked. ""Who do you work for?""

""It's called Full Service Evictions, but they're a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unlimited Partners. They have a vision for fixing the problems that the government can't, and turning a tidy profit while doing so. And unlike the government, *they're* hiring police officers right now.""

""Who *else* are they hiring?"" the young man interrupted. ""I'm more than willing to work, but times are really tough.""

""We can sort through all of that tomorrow,"" the guard offered. ""You all need to pay off your debts, and if the firm can make use of your skills, that helps both of us!""

""That sounds great,"" sighed the young man sanguinely. ""I can't believe this eviction might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

""That's what Unlimited Partners is all about!"" the guard trilled. ""Win-win scenarios, and making full use of available resources. I think you'll find them a vast improvement over the failing government.""

""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" Clara added. ""It's a pretty low bar to start with.""

The guard, and everyone sitting in the van, shared a laugh.

""OK, officer Charles, I've got a solution worked out,"" Jason explained. ""There's an older dorm at the same college where the tenants are being housed; it's scheduled for demolition, but that's been delayed, since the college can't afford it. It should be good enough for prisoners. They're certainly nicer accommodations than they'd have in jail!""

""But will it be secure?"" Officer Charles seemed skeptical. ""We don't want them escaping.""

""Not to worry!"" Jason assured. ""Several security drones are being moved there, as we speak. They're capable of tasing a moving target from fifty yards away. Plus, we're including two drones armed with sniper rifles. And all of them are tied together with surveillance A.I., monitored by human oversight. No one is getting out of there unless we say so.""

""Where did you get such amazing equipment?"" Charles marveled.

""In bankruptcy, believe it or not,"" Jason related. ""The companies that made these devices intended to sell them to the government, but after a fierce series of protests, the contracts were canceled. They then found they were legally blocked from selling their products to anyone else. But *acquiring* those companies was still legal, which we did for pennies on the dollar, and now we use the equipment for our own purposes.""

""Very clever,"" Charles replied with a smile.

""It's really just a consequence of the central problem of representative government,"" Jason explained. ""If a lawyer can't make a living, finding clients that want to pay for their services, then they go out of business and become a politician. These bad lawyers then write laws that are analyzed by *good* lawyers, who find plenty of loopholes in them, allowing them to continue to do whatever they want, unimpeded by the authorities.""

Charles scratched his chin. ""I've never heard it put like that before. That actually explains a lot!""

Jason punched a few more buttons on his phone. ""We'll send the directions to your vans' onboard computers. Our equipment knows how to talk to them; after all, we own the same kind of vans.""

""That sounds great!"" Officer Charles beamed. ""We really appreciate your firm's help. Oh...on that note...can we all get your card or something? None of us know if we'll get defunded soon. And our old co-workers seem to be really happy with their new jobs.""

""Absolutely!"" Jason opened up his briefcase, and fetched a small stack of business cards, handing them to Charles. ""Feel free to hand these out to whomever you like."" He grabbed a larger fistful of cards and handed those over too. ""Including anyone that isn't here tonight.""

""I'd be glad to!"" Officer Charles looked around. ""So, are we done here? I think all the tenants have been dealt with, and the movers and cleaners have already gotten to work.""

""We sure are. As soon as the tenants get taken to their new home, I'm off to the next raid of the evening.""

""Really?"" Officer Charles sounded concerned. ""You're working awfully late tonight.""

""No, I'm like you; I'm part of the night shift,"" Jason explained. ""But a few more successes like this under my belt, and I'll probably be allowed to change to the day shift. No one starts at the top, after all.""

""*That's* for sure!"" Officer Charles laughed. ""Hey, do you need police backup for that? I mean, we're already here, and we're *supposed* to get relieved, but given how things are, I never know if anyone is going to show up for the next shift.""

""We'd really appreciate that!"" Jason concurred. He looked at his phone. ""They should be ready for us by the time we arrive.""

""Works for me! See you there!"" Charles and Jason each headed to their respective vans, and the caravan drove away into the night. A series of flatbed trucks, loaded with steel shipping containers, moved into the vacated space. The first movers emerged from the building with furniture, with spider-bots close on their heels, carrying plastic-wrapped boxes."

China's gene giant harvests data from millions of women

By Kirsty Needham, Clare Baldwin

Reuters

--- 

>A Chinese gene company selling prenatal tests around the world developed them in collaboration with the country's military and is using them to collect genetic data from millions of women for sweeping research on the traits of populations, a Reuters review of scientific papers and company statements found.

>Reuters has found that BGI’s prenatal test, one of the most popular in the world, is a source of genetic data for the company, which has worked with the Chinese military to improve “population quality” 

what?

>and on genetic research to combat hearing loss and altitude sickness in soldiers.

>BGI says it stores and re-analyses left-over blood samples and genetic data from the prenatal tests, sold in at least 52 countries to detect abnormalities such as Down’s syndrome in the foetus. The tests – branded NIFTY for “Non-Invasive Fetal TrisomY” – also capture genetic information about the mother, as well as personal details such as her country, height and weight, but not her name, BGI computer code viewed by Reuters shows.

>So far, more than 8 million women have taken BGI’s prenatal tests globally. BGI has not said how many of the women took the test abroad, and said it only stores location data on women in mainland China.

>A 2016 Chinese regulation requires samples and genetic sequences from the tests on Chinese women to be kept for at least three years, after which the women can request that the data is deleted. For women overseas, BGI told Reuters it destroys samples and deletes paper records and electronic data after a maximum of five years.

>Reuters reviewed more than 100 documents, from research papers to marketing materials, to determine the scope of data being captured by BGI through its prenatal tests, how it is using this in its research and its military collaboration. Reuters also interviewed more than two dozen scientists and experts in genetic law, including researchers who worked with the company, as well as four women, in Poland, Spain and Thailand, who took the tests.

>The women, who signed consent forms stating that their genetic data would be stored and used for research, said they did not realise their genetic information could end up in China.

>BGI told Reuters the project – known as the “Chinese Millionome Database” – does not contain data of women outside mainland China.

>However, online records reviewed by Reuters show that the genetic data of at least 500 women who have taken the NIFTY test, including some outside China, are stored in the government-funded China National GeneBank.

>Last year, BGI announced that it would “industrialise” genomics, and in April, it said a “million-scale” prototype robot, capable of sequencing a million whole genomes a year for population genomics, was now being used to process NIFTY tests.

"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"Musicianship in a cyberpunk worldI know in reality we listen to certain electronic music and call it ""cyberpunk music"" because it evokes the themes or atmosphere of a work of cyberpunk fiction... But I'm curious about what you could call the inversion of that.

My question: in a cyberpunk world, what is it like to be a musician?  Obviously, the answer can vary depending on the particulars of the setting. 

Here's a list of elements I'd expect from cyberpunk musicianship:

* Matrix jam sessions. Jack in and have a jam session with your buds. Play whatever instrument you can think of/code up.  Save samples from the jam and mix them into new songs in minutes.

* A vast majority of meatspace instruments would be electronic and mid-tier and above might have a mini-deck in them to interface with the grid, for holo broadcasting live music.

* Mass-produced instruments would be easy to play, but would be very limited. Like a midi keyboard that can only play notes in one key, and automatically do only chords in that key. In these cases, musicianship is dumbed down so that anyone can play some notes that sound okay together.

* Cyberpunks might build their own instruments that would also be electronic but, like MIDI instruments today, are capable of playing many different notes. Would be similar in function to the mass produced shit but the notes would be digitally-synthesized by the creator of the instrument. The sound would be highly distinct from mass-produced instruments but would not allow for very much expressiveness from the player.  These would be the low-medium tier instruments.

* Expert cyberluthiers might integrate high-density touchscreens into the instrument that allows for higher-definition input. This would approximate an analog electronic instrument like an electric guitar.

* ""Old-fashioned"" electronic instruments would be easy to make, but would require also using an Analog-digital-converter before being usable in pretty much any modern application. So, they exist but are pretty much just a hobby project for interested musicians.

* The only acoustic/brass/woodwind instruments anyone sees anymore on a regular basis belong to CEOs, who have carefully manufactured androids to play them.  Naturally, these androids sound technically skilled and precise but are missing the subtle, indescribable expressiveness of a real human virtuoso. If memory serves, this sort of lacking was described in Big O about a robot pianist.

Of course these are just my expectations. What are yours?"
"So I was playing Sleeping Dogs, and it really struck me how ""almost-cyberpunk"" it felt— what do you think will happen when ""contemporary"" becomes indistinguishable from ""cyberpunk""?The only thing the game lacks is the 'high tech' aspect, and even then it was borderline already there. It might be because it so perfectly captured the essence of Hong Kong that I feel this way, and did it through the lens of a brutal cop/crim drama, all the while being set in contemporary times. 

More than Grand Theft Auto or Watch_Dogs, I feel Sleeping Dogs is representative of how proto-cyberpunk our times really are.

Obviously, the smartphone is a very cyberpunk device, but video game characters have had them for years now, and we in real life are blunted to just how sci-fi these gadgets really are— precisely because they *aren't* sci-fi anymore. The thing is, a lot of gadgets are straddling the line between science fiction and reality nowadays. 

It got me thinking about what an intentionally high-tech Sleeping Dogs 2 would look like. If the first game is gonna piss about with karaoke, then certainly the second could fart around with virtual reality. And organized crime is always utilizing the latest in technology in order to circumvent the law. This would mean the use of things like drones, very hackable drones. And it's not like there aren't robots out there nowadays. There's even a humanoid robot tearing up the sales charts— Aldebaran's ""Pepper"", whose brains are none other than IBM's Watson.

With that all considered, I stopped thinking about Sleeping Dogs in particular and began thinking about *any* contemporary-set video game. I just scratched the surface of our modern tech capabilities, after all. It's not going to be long until major car companies start following in Ehang's footsteps and creating flying cars (which they will call 'manned drones'), and our phones' personal AI assistants keep getting better every day. 

So let's imagine an open world video game set in 2023, the same year it's released.  It includes all of what I just said and more, and it's set in an Eastasian megalopolis— maybe Hong Kong, maybe Guangzhou, maybe Seoul— with a cop/crim plotline much like that of Sleeping Dogs or Grand Theft Auto. It's even possible an advanced deep learning superalgorithm is a character in the story.

Where do the contemporary elements end and cyberpunk begin? It's clearly not *meant* to be a cyberpunk game, but if the game were released 10 years prior, it would be considered a cyberpunk classic.

It's part of the whole phenomena of science fiction slowly becoming an obsolete genre as technology marches on."
"Synaptica: ConnectionsIn the academy we have a saying. Everything connected.

It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent upon all the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptica there is one connection of paramount importance. And that is the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron you can control the fate of man. 

The woman hung from the radio antennae, naked and upside down, legs nailed together as if she were JC superstar, platinum blonde hair streaked with blood and flapping across her face her like a plastic bag in a storm. 

“We found her like this,” the patrolman announces “about an hour ago, neighbor who lives in the high rise across the way called it in. Said it looked like someone was trying to climb the antenna. Then when we got here we found her...like that.”

“And the android?” I ask.

The patrolman motions towards the rooftop ledge. I follow, stepping gingerly over the police tape, shoes crunching on the cold gravel as we approach the figure tucked against the parapet wall. The light from my subdermal implant cutting through the midnight gloom until it falls upon this pretzeled man, still leaking antifreeze from his head. iHuman assistant, 2063 model. Dressed in a slim-fit charcoal suit with a black tie and cotton white shirt. Pinocchio shave job and immaculately trimmed fingernails. Perfect gentleman were it not for his four limbs which have been snapped back behind him as if here were some giant dead insect. 

“Why do they do that?” The patrolman keeping his distance.

“Do what?”

“Contort like that?”

“Piezoelectric muscle fibers. When they bite the bullet the muscles contract. Tighter and tighter until they fold completely in on themselves. Did you move him?”

“No. No one has touched a thing.”

I crouch over the machine. His head is buried inside his hands. Madonna wept. Taking a fountain pen out from my coat pocket and I slide one hand from the robot’s face, revealing two empty sockets where eyes used to be, now crusting over with aquamarine gel. 

“Shit.” the patrolman exclaims. “Clawed his fucking eyes out. Why would he, why would he do that?”

I straighten up as I canvas the rooftop. Pillars of steam rising up from chimney pipes. Whirling turbine fans from the air conditioner units. The occasional ping of heated metal emanating off tetris ductwork. 

“Why would an android do any of this?” I counter, pacing back to the woman and trying to gauge how high off the ground she really was. Then from behind me comes another voice, deeper and rough, like gargled sand in tonic water.

“Who the fuck is this?” 

I turn to see this police officer emerging from the rooftop accessway and marching past the taped off perimeter. He is big, grizzled and raw, like a shark out of water. Some dried up genealogy with nothing else to lose. Black combat fatigues, ex-military then. Hair beginning to edge grey but the pumped iron biceps of someone half his age. Cigarette pinched between the whirling articulation of his prosthetic arm until he flicks the bud casually over the ledge.

“Is anyone going to answer me?” He barks getting closer. “You guys let someone else onto my crime scene, no one thought to ask me. Last time I checked I run mech Ops. That still correct?”

“Synaptic.” Patrolman whispers. 

“What?”

“He’s Synaptic.”

There is silence on the rooftop as the detective chews this over. My eyes are still glued up on our victim, trying to figure out just how the android got her up the antenna. I rest my hand on the scaffolding while the detective attempts to compose himself. I can feel the cold bite of November running through the metal. 

“Ahem.” The officer coughs with every ounce of self control. Out the corner of my eye I can see him extending his gauntlet at me. 

“Mitch Connors. District Investigator. Mechanical Operations.”

“Cerpin Vex.” I say barely acknowledging him. Hoisting myself up onto the antenna instead and climbing hand over hand up the metal lattice towards my down-on-her-luck Rapunzel. 

“They, uh, sent you down here to…”

“You ever see a case like this?” I ask.

“A case like this, no. I can’t say that I…”

“A malfunction.”

Mitch crosses his arm, looking back and forth from the enucleated android to the femme fatale. 

“Android malfunction? Shit many times. Back when I was a cadet this was all we’d get. 10-16’s like night and day. My robot is trying to kill me. But that was before they had quite figured out the logic algorithms. There hasn’t been a case like this in…”

“Eighteen years. May 3rd, 2119. Outside Detroit. That was the last confirmed malfunction.”

“Yeah,” Mitch perplexed but mostly uninterested “...if you say so.”

Still climbing I reach the woman. Extending my arm I grab her skull. Digging my fingernails hard into her scalp and looking for ghosts. 

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of having everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way as an electrocuted prisoner. A microscopic unit of life with only one purpose, to carry an electrical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, these little bastards will modify the strength or the frequency of the signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They just transmit. 

And underneath my fingernails are the receivers. SQUIDS. Superconducting quantum interface devices. Sensitive enough to detect and decode the cacophony of magneto-encephalographic waves emitted by a human brain. The first of many psycho-surgical “gifts” implanted into a Synaptic. A tool allowing us, for lack of a better phrase, to read minds. 

It doesn’t take me long to realize that no one’s home. She’s likely been dead for hours. I pull my hand away, brushing off flecks of that blue gel when something else catches my attention and I lean in. A small copper necklace dangling around her engorged throat, with an inverted cross at the end. I snap the cross from her neck and begin my descent back to the rooftop. 

“Can I get you an evidence bag for that?” Mitch calls up. “Maybe follow some fucking crime scene protocols.” I ignore him as I climb back down. 

As I drop the last few feet to the ground, Mitch, who has been inspecting the other android, stands up. 

“The eyes are kinda weird. I mean he clawed out her eyes, strung her up there and then clawed out his own?

“No.” I tell him, picking residual coolant from my fingernails “He did his eyes first. She still has his blue fluid stuck in her hair.”

“So he hauled her up there and nailed her in completely blind?”

“Would appear so.”

I stop at the rooftop access, an itch on the back of my mind screaming that the calculation was in error. Turn back to the crime scene, the woman, the android, the trillion chromatic lights of the city beyond. 

“Get the victim's body down” I instruct the patrolman “and packaged off to forensics. Android as well.”

Then I am gone, descending the condominium stairwell. Trying to ignore the water damage trickling down the cinderblock wall or the checkerboard tiling. This is what always happened on a case. One that internal camera started rolling it was almost impossible to stop. My brain would keep searching for clues until it had constructed some sort of justifiable meaning from reality. This is the second Synaptic implant already hard at work. The Abacampus. 

I am halfway down this rabbit hole when the detective bursts through the doorway above. 

“What the fuck do you think your doing?” Mitch yells at me over the dusted banister railing.

“My job, Detective Connors.”

“This is my precinct,” he shouts, taking stairs two at a time  “android malfunction falls under mech Ops jurisdiction. Why is pre-crime even involved here...she’s...she is dead already!”

“Detective Connors, do you know how many iHuman units there are in this city?”

“No but…”

“No one does. That’s how ubiquitous they are. And since the company that manufactured them went bankrupt there is no central registrar available to track them all down. Makes mass recall all but impossible. Which means that if these machines are capable of killing it' is a big fucking deal.”

My feet slide to halt and I turn on the detective. “Which is why they sent me. Now I am sorry if you feel my department is stepping on toes but that's how it is sweetheart. Don't like it, you can piss off. Or you can tag along while the professionals stop a goddamn catastrophe.” I resume marching down the stairs but Connors has not had enough. He follows. 

“That’s all well and good, Mr. whatever-your-name-was. But I’ve run this beat since you were sucking thumbs, with a damn fine track records and...hold your fucking panties son, I ain’t done with you…”

He grabs my jacket and I snap. Jackknifing the palm of my hand up towards his nose. Aimed such that the nasal bones will be fragment into his frontal cortex. An instantly lethal blow. At the last second my sympathies intervene and I curl my fingers instead into a fist. My punch knocks him to the cinderblock wall, but does not kill him. He slumps against the floor clutching at his now broken nose as I step over him.

“Detective Connors, do not ever touch me again. I am heading to the station. You can meet me in forensics if you want to be there when we open the android up. Or not.” Then I continue down the stairs.

My interceptor is waiting for me in the garage. I saddle into the vehicle and program coordinates for SFPD. M-foils unfolding as the grav-car lifts away from the parking slot and makes its way out of the skyrise garage. Flitting out into the night to join the technicolor plaid of downtown air traffic. Through the windshield, virtual rails guide my ride on collision course with our destination. I can see raindrops beginning to dot the glass. 

The city spreads out below my like an underpaid call girl, beautiful but just as likely to slit your throat. My car weaves through what was left of the sky, artificial canyons rising on all sides ever higher as I enter into the Corporate Nexus. Towering structures merging one on top of the other until it is all just concrete tesseract. Size and perspective being luxuries one can’t afford when you are this rich. Around me dance the real denizens of this place, holographic advertisements and commercialized paraphernalia. Blink and the neon billboard in front of you has morphed into a styrofoam cup of joe. Marketing algorithms reading your mind almost as well as a Synaptica could. I really could go for a cup of coffee. 

The brain, that was where we left off. Your precious, unique, incomprehensible brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and just left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but this organ, for all intents and purposes, is an overrated computer. Here is how it works. Afferent neurons carry sensory input from the universe. This information is processed through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons issue commands to the body. Cause and effect. A connection machine. 

Which is to say that you...are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you otherwise is peddling used snake oil. Don’t get me wrong, this machine’s complexity and elegance rivals all else in nature. But when you really dissect to the nitty gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. 

Exiting the Nexus the terrain levels off and the lights go out as I drop into the Boxes. Rows and columns of prefabricated apartments, stacked one on top of each other like schizophrenic brickyards. I can barely see the streets here, narrow enough to make you catch your breath. But I know what is down there. Ghetto, squalor and crime. Everything this city runs on. Sacrificial offerings to the god of convenience, automation. Automation leads to unemployment gives rise to crime. Everything Connected. 

Finally, looming over the horizon, is that familiar hammerhead silhouette of SFPD. The district police station quietly watching over her city. I ride the elevator down to the basement and after some searching around locate the forensics department where the Android dissection is already taking place.

The technician peers delicately into his juniper green terminal screen. “I hate to tell you guys this but there ain’t much here. Android must have hit auto-delete...wiped his mind clean on the way out.”

Mitch, the tech and I are crammed into the underground quarters housing forensics, a series of interconnected rooms with dim lighting and the noxious smell of formaldehyde. I am resting against a countertop containing a grimy washing sink and an unplugged coffee machine. In the middle of the room, lying stripped-naked on a gurney, is our perpetrator. The tech has his skull opened up, various wires snaking into the silicon cobweb of his processor unit. Mitch is dabbing blood with a kleenex from his newly fractured nose. 

“Try defragmenting.” Mitch says confidently “See if we can recover anything that way.”

“One second...” The tech phonetically tapping into his keyboard while I plug in the coffee machine.

“..no, nothing. Overwritten and scrubbed to zeroes.”

“Impossible,” Mitch declares. “Only way to do that is if you have the factory encryption codes.”

“Which were likely demolished,” I say “along with the factory itself years ago.” In the top cabinet to the left, next to plastic utensils and accumulating dust, is a tin canister of old coffee grinds which I gladly scoop out into the machine. “Check for serial numbers.”

Mitch pulls a knife from his boot, then filets open the android’s right foot, cutting midline from toes to heel. Synthetic padding, the texture of cottage cheese, spills from the wound. Brushing this away Mitch reveals the bone. 

“Reads...no, fucking way. They filed this off too. Means this unit was probably stolen and traded on the black market.” Mitch looks up at me, frustrated.

“Coffee?” I raise my cup to him then take a sip. It tastes like fresh ass.

“Any ideas from the enlightened Synaptic would be fucking great.” 

I look the android over then walk to the corner where the tech had piled the android's clothing. Fishing in the pile I retrieve his suit jacket which I unceremoniously flop over his dead corpse. Sewn inside the lapel, someone has embroidered a name. “Ghezzi.”

I feed the name into my subdermal and a holo-map springs into existence above my wrist. “High-end professional tailor. Custom suits by design. Owned a small shop on Balboa Avenue until…”

“Until what?” The tech, whom I had forgotten was even in the room, inquires.

“...until the shop burned down to the ground six months ago. With him inside.”

MItch slams his fist on the steel gurney, hard enough to leave a dent. “So where does that leave us?”

“Coroner is working on the girl. He says he needs six hours to prepare a decent report. Means we just have to wait.”

The elevator up to the street level grinds slowly to a halt and Mitch and I exit via the lobby. We are standing outside in the courtyard entrance to SFPD, watching night shifters trickle into the building. In the center of the courtyard are the bones of a once gigantic tree. Broad and gnarled with a broken crown and bark fossilized into chalk. It had been a bristlecone pine, one of the last unengineered trees on the west coast. I know this cause the plaque next to where we are standing says so.

Now most people, when they look at a neuron, see something akin to a tree. Beautiful dendritic branches soaking up chemical sunlight. Electrical signals flowing down an axonal trunk. Terminating into the widespread roots, only to propagate onto the next neuron ad infinitum. That is how most people see the neuron. Myself, I never see the tree. To me the neuron only resembles one thing. A radioactive mushroom cloud blooming over a still dying world. After all that's really all a connection is. A means to an end. 

“I can already tell you what this is going to be.” Mitch says lighting another cigarette. “Dead end. Cases that start out like this always end that way. Unsolved.”

“Not this one.”

Peeking over his cig, Mitch frowns. “And how do you know that?”

“Because I have never had an unsolved case.”

I take out a business card, flipping it between my fingers and handing it over to Mitch.

“This is the motel I am currently staying at. Meet me there in an hour. I have something I need to take care of first but, I figure I owe you a drink.” I zero my finger around my own nose. “Cause of the...you know.”

I leave Mitch there bemused. Walking east towards my hotel but then veering a couple blocks north instead.

"So I have a story concept: cyberpunk/sovietpunk + '70s stoner rock + A Clockwork OrangeJust today, I've come up with a dystopian story concept. Anyone who knows me knows I'm working on a semi-utopian work of science/speculative fiction (though I haven't updated it recently, it has a subreddit, /r/MotherMeki). In the past few weeks, I've decided to clean it and [another story](/r/AstralFalls) up, removing a lot of bloat that wasn't gelling with what the stories had become and what my plan for them involved.

One story that spun off from these works is a story I have decided to call ""***Black Saturday***"". It's still in its infancy, though it benefits from having several concepts already worked out. In fact, a lot of this is being put down in words for the first time as I write this, and I'll almost certainly write up the story itself later on tonight or tomorrow.

#*So here's the gist*

The setting is England in an alternate timeline. World War II lasted twelve years, from 1939 to 1951, and this is due to Hitler being assassinated in 1941 and replaced with a much more competent leader (as of yet unnamed). Britain was invaded, occupied for half a decade, and then subsequently bombed back into the stone age during the American invasion. Japan stayed out of America's business until 1943, thus taking more of China and Manchuria and thus being more capable of fighting a prolonged war. Nuclear bombs fell on America, Japan, Germany, Russia, and Britain, and several hundred million were killed. Japan managed to maintain their empire in the East so they reached a stalemate with the US and Soviets. 

The resulting world became a softcore *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, until roughly the '80s. Then America balkanized and it was all down to the Soviets and Japanese.

With the US's fall, any aid Britain was receiving stopped coming, and society all but collapsed. Japan and the USSR rush to take the West. In Britain, the Soviets grabbed the government, but the Japanese established corporate power, and these two sides war against each other.

The story revolves around three British youths, collectively known as the ""*Blood Wizards of Walpurgis*"". 

- Sturgis Kingsley. A Cockney kid from a broken home, who's easily the most morally reprehensible of them all, having done his bits with the old ""in-out-in-out"" multiple times. To rub it in, he carries a phallic wobbly bat around.

- Donny Lordhouse. He's actually a cyborg, and he's the most laid back of the group. He's probably the only one with actual motive, as he was born without arms, and his prosthetic arms were ripped off by a sore-loser rich brat after he beat him at a game. Donny couldn't do anything since said brat was the son of a commissary. 

- Oswald Gallagher. Oswald is the true cyberpunk, and he's gotten his mates to join him in online trolling. This one is malicious; Ozzy once deleted a working man's entire stash of bitcoins— his life savings— for the lulz. 

Three schoolboys of the Dunhurst Studentry. Moptopped rocker-haired misfits with stupendous sideburns who have taken to drugs and ultraviolence. They were raised in a Soviet schooling system (a Studentry), yet have turned their backs on order. Their daily lives involve getting stoned, harassing people, breaking robots, and getting involved in gang fights. 

The whole region is locked down in something very strongly resembling the Irish Troubles, complete with street violence, bombings, and gun battles.

The government has become increasingly totalitarian, while the corporations are doing their best to cement their own power. All this is doing is worsening gang violence. 

The Blood Wizards of Walpurgis are so named because they beat a man to death and used his blood to tag the words 'Wizard Bloody Wizard' onto a wall. They're also suspected of occultism, particularly cyber occultism— a new variant caused by nanotechnology. Of which, they are guilty. In fact, their whole borough is known as 'Walpurgis' because of all the cyber occult and cyber Satanic active; electric wizards using nanotech to download demons from the internet. 


The story itself has two perspectives. One is third person limited, following each Blood Wizard's side story. The other is first person collective perspective; that is, all three Blood Wizards as one. This is how the main story is told. As of right now, the main story is very simple: it's the Blood Wizards pissing off powerful people and dealing with the consequences through raw, bloody violence until they wind up getting drawn away from each other; Kingsley becoming a fascist, Lordhouse becoming a part of the corporations, and Ozzy becoming an anarchist.

They are unapologetic punks in full. They are nadsat brats from the future. The architecture is more inspired by 1970's Britain than traditional cyberpunk. In fact, as I look into the story more and more, I'm starting to realize that this is basically a '70s reimagining of cyberpunk. There's a lot more electronic riff rock and post-hippie nonsense, a lot more psychedelia and navel gazing. Basically what Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" looks like if it were rewritten by William Gibson and sung by 1971-era Black Sabbath. 

I'd argue that it's more cyber-nadsat than cyberpunk. I don't know what I'm saying either because I'm responding to it just as much as you are, but that's the vibe I'm getting. I need to see where this goes."
"Roundup of TheGM's film synopses and impressions of various cyberpunk, retrowave, synthwave, and outrun songs, from Youtube commentsSo some of you may be familiar with the NewRetroWave music channel on Youtube. The soundtracks there range from cyberpunk Blade Runner tribute songs, synthwave, 80s Miami Vice era throwback songs, or retrowave as it's called, outrun. 

I started noticing that one user would often write up a film synopsis-esque piece of writing, or literary impression of the soundtrack. I started collecting them because I thought they were pretty evocative. They're only between a sentence or two to a paragraph, so they're not long, but there's already a narrative presence there in most of them. I think the more serious cyberpunk ones actually come pretty close to Gibson's writing style, and a lot of the other ones capture the retrofuturistic, Sylvester Stallone / Kurt Russell type cinema vehicle, hardboiled revenge cop film, or 80s sci fi fiction tone. A handful are in a Richard Simmons full on cheesy aerobics video style. 

I feel like this guy has this little obscure piece of cyberpunk net culture and wanted to post them here. Reddit's fucking with the formatting so each paragraph and spacing is a different one.

Today is the 7th week of fighting in New Australia as United Federation Forces conduct search and destroy missions on New Order Command or NO-Com outposts in the region.

*The veil of darkness never truly sets on the city.

The haze of the rain and neon lights makes rainbow colors dance above the street, but those walking below hardly notice; just like they don't notice the man in the brown overcoat stepping out of the steam venting from the sewers. The coated figure flicks away his spent cigarillo and proceeds down the street with his eyes fixed on his target, weaving through the crowd until he gets a clear view of the older man selling recycled noodles from his little push cart.

"Cyberpunk Premises?What are some cyberpunk premises for literature, games, films, etc. you've thought up? Here's one I made up when I was like 13 or something after playing Dead Space and I've been fucking around with the idea since, not that I have the skill to actually produce any interesting media about.

> So get this, the Burj Khalifa, times twenty, on Phobos, the larger moon of Mars. It's the early 23rd century, and 75-85% of the Earth's population migrated to Mars on colony ships because of global warming/nukes/climate change or something. Factions based mostly on language are formed between the human colonies, with massive cities being constructed from sections of the colony ships and automatic construction. Terraformers are increasing the oxygen content of the planet, and water is extracted from the poles. Anyways none of that matters because I can't even start to think about the fucked up geopolitics on a planet with no oceans or atmosphere. 
 
 > So anyways, super space Burj Khalifa 2.0, named Al-lat, was built by the UAE/some rich Arab superstate as a high end resort/residence for the wealthy from all around the world, using particle acceleration engines that reduce trips to Martian space to a month or two versus half a decade. With millions of kilos of luxury supplies stored outside of the main structure, as well as hydroponic farms, a satellite network, and multiple nuclear reactors, Al-lat is entirely self-sufficient, capable of housing around 400,000 people. By the time of this exodus, the project has been in a funding crisis for years and the few people that remain are a couple of the construction company officials, wealthy investors fleeing political turmoil, around 60,000 workers, and several thousand security personnel. The rich/security officials live on the lower, more finished portion of Al-lat, and most of the workers live in the higher, incomplete portions, in a proto-slum called ""The Penthouse"", constantly threatened by the low structural integrity of the neglected architecture. I imagine this as a bunch of people living in scrap shantytowns ironically built on top of unfinished resort structures such as malls, hotels, amusement parks, etc.
> Although they are aware of whatever crisis caused the migration, it will be years before any of the supermassive colony ships(too large for particle accelerator engines because they explode when they're big or use too much energy or something idk how I'm gonna handwave that one) reach Mars, and the few refugees arriving in hijacked industrial ships are shot down by the planetary (moon-etary?) defenses. A separatist faction of the Slavic Union's (Basically USSR 2.0 but space fascism) Navy runs off with a good deal of their spaceships and a bunch of nukes while the main government decides to stay on what is left of Earth. They lay waste to Al-lat's defenses, and curbstomp the security before occupying the station and continuing construction to accommodate  the 100k or so people they brought with them, as well as building a nuclear defense system on Deimos, the smaller Martian moon. The larger population only further increases the strain on the systems that allow Al-lat to be self sufficient and a divide is very quickly formed between the laboring slumgoers and the Military/Security government.
 > 30 or so years later, Martian colonies have already become semi-developed and there exists a black market smuggling trade between them and the denizens of Al-lat. Sometime, somehow, a biological agent developed by an ancient Martian civilization finds it's way into Al-lat. Originally created as a performance enhancing combat stimulant for a Martian species, this agent is a rapidly reproducing bioorganism that has very different effects on humans. The organism latches into the nervous system before spreading across the veins and arteries, manifesting as a fungus like covering over the skin, then clustering and ultimately immobilizing the host (Think TLOU cordyceps)). Those exposed to it quickly become irrationally aggressive, and they will not cease attacking any other living thing, including other hosts, until their muscles are totally destroyed or their nervous system is. The catch is, if you have been exposed to any amount of genetic material from this Martian species (which is possible enough if you've been in contact with the fossilized remains of one or one of their biomechanical artifacts), then the agent works as originally intended and you basically have superpowers. As expected, shit hits the fan when this spreads into the Penthouse, and the security forces, formed from the Separatists, come in and try to slaughter everything with a pulse.

Now show me some of your scenarios, doesn't have to be paragraphs long word vomit like mine lol, just shit you think would be cool that isn't ""big city 30 years in the future with robots and shit""."

**Strands**

Connections.

In the academy we have a saying, ‘Everything Connected’. It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent on all of the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptic there is one connection that matters more than all the others, the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron then you can control the fate of man.

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way that a person strapped into an electrocutioner chair is. This microscopic lifeform has only one purpose, which is to carry an electrochemical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, the neuron will modify the strength or frequency of this signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They transmit a signal.  

These little fuckers come in all shapes and lengths, but the classic example is something closely resembling a tree. The branches being these cytoplasmic extensions termed dendrites, which receive chemical signal from adjoining nerves. This is translated into an electrical pulse which travels down to the cell body, known as the soma, then to the axon, a long conducting fiber which in our analogy would be the tree trunk. The axon then divides into terminal axons and these rootlike projections release neurotransmitters, thus propagating the signal onto the next neuron.

What does this have to do with my exodus from Earth? In one word, everything.

When I wake the next morning everything is unchanged. The old man is still bolted onto the wall across from me, still jacked in, a hesitant wallop of saliva contemplating a jump from his lips. Poor guy. This is what happens when your family can’t pony up enough money to put you in a decent virtual retirement home. Shoved into a place like this until you are ripe enough to slot into a tighter, slightly cheaper hole. I would hope the geezer's family at the very least could afford a decent simulation for him. Golfing or veranding with leftover friends. I switch the lights off on my way out. Close the door gently so as not to catch his cachectic fingers in the hinges. Poor guy.

Breakfast consists of vat grown eggs, scrambled with some homeboy hot sauce and a piece of soy pressed into the vague shape of bacon. Actually not bad. Little soggy. The frycook on the opposite side of the food cart gives me a hard look. Frowning at the blue light peeking through my shaggy bedhead. Which reminds me that before heading down to the dock I should cover up. I need a hat. 

I spend about an another hour wandering the streets, checking in niche shops and vendor stands but to no avail. No hats. The best I can find is this crumpled bandana at a thrift booth. A broad, off-white cloth with a black and red oriental pattern on the fringe. Makes me look like a confederate soldier with a bloody head concussion. Grungy, yet next-gen. Cliche yet comfortable in a way I just can’t seem to shake. 

I shrug. Whatever gets the job done. It will conceal my Synaptic Implant from hostile eyes at least. I pay the vendor and wrap the bandana over my head. Then I make for the docks.

As I approach the docks the streets open up again. Brief glimpses of sunlight penetrating through the industrial haze, casting long silhouettes on the sidewalk. Gradually then all at once, the street morphs amphibious. Detritus exchanging for fishmongers hawking chum, scurrying dock workers and the occasional wharf rat as big as a rottweiler. The piers are heavy with water rot, some already well on there way to sinking back into the deep. But I am just glad to have that pulpy smell of decaying wood in the air. It is so rare these days, wood. Even rotting, it smells unique. 

A surveillance drone hovers out of an alley on the left. These are Tri-blades, robotic beetle husks suspended by three overclocked rotary fins. Like a Freddy Krueger remake of the bumblebee. The Tri-blade hovers among the crowd, biometrically scanning for riff-raff. I tug my jacket collar higher, hoping I still fell below the probable cause threshold, as I hustled my ass down Pier Seven. Mitch is waiting for me there at the end of the pier.

“‘Milton. You’re late,” Mitch grunts.

“I guess.”

“What's that?” Meaning my bandana. 

“You said to get a hat.”

“Makes you look like a turd,” Mitch turns back to the ocean. “Don't be late again. In space everything is trying to kill you, and the only force stopping that is your shipmates. You say you tightened that airlock fastener and you didn't, we all get sucked into space. Do you hear me? In space your word is your bond.”

“Ok, relax, I got it. Won't happen again.”

Ahead of us is the ocean. Wide, mysterious and unbroken by the storms that had ravaged her coast last night. Grey waves metronomically thunking against the pier. In the distance, just against the horizon, I can see a thin vertical line. It is unsightly, meaning startling, and then soon lost to notice. Just another glitch or burnt out cathode ray on the celestial firmament. 

This is the Tsiolkovsky space elevator.

The thin line rises up from the ocean, stretching into the sky where it is joined by five other identical black lines, all converging in parallel, then lost in the stratosphere. As if some malevolent giant had suspended the Earth on marionette strings.

“Have you ever been up the elevator?” He asks me.

“No. No reason too. That's outside Hegemony jurisdiction. That’s Teether Six right?”

“Yup,” Mitch affirmed.

And they all feed up,” I traced the black lines as they climbed upward, “...to converge at the Low Earth Orbital station.”

“Yeah, but we will have to travel even farther, up to GEO. That’s where most ships dock. Including the Erebus.”

“It’ll take three days?”

“More or less,” Mitch motions to a barnicled fishing trawler that is moored nearby. “Fisherman who owns that boat says he can take us to the base of Teether Six for eighteen credits. 

“Sounds like a good deal,” I comment, eyeing another Tri-blade which has appeared on the other end of the pier and begun interrogating passersby. “What are we waiting for.”

“You mostly.”

I follow Mitch to the rickety boat, toss my duffle bag onto the unswabbed deck and climb aboard. After a coughing stutter the rusty engine pedals us out from the dock. The surveillance drone reaches the end of our pier moments later, watching our boat float away. I can almost imagine the faint sound of paparazzi snapshots on suspicious individual number 160217662. We sail out of the harbor.

“In other news world markets continue to reel from the Mardova cyberattack three days ago. An international manhunt still ongoing to locate the terrorist responsible. Authorities urge anyone with information to come forward immedia…”

Hearing footsteps, I tap my phone and the radio broadcast cuts silent. A second later, Mitch bangs the screen door to the cabin open, stomping onto the deck and bristling from shoulder to shoulder. 

“I just talked to the fisherman,” Mitch complains. “He said he changed his mind, now is insisting we pay him twenty five credits. For no good reason. I told him I am about to change my mind about tossing him overboard and taking his ship. He is thinking that part over.”

I shrug, “Lets not cause too much trouble here.”

The sea oscillates and writhes around our boat. We are just entering the trans-pacific garbage patch, refuge to the zombified containers and technocolor plastic wrappers of a civilization. A million tiny pieces of styrofoam and flotsam bobbing up and down, watching us trespass into their domain.

Mitch seems to quiet down a bit, leans against the railing beside me. Lights another cigarette.

“You don’t talk much do you?”

“Nope,” I reply.

“Why?”

“I’d prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.”

“Why’s that?”

“Because I am tired of having other people's thoughts in there.”

“What do you mean?”

“When I, when a Synaptic, cracks someone, we don’t just get inside their mind, they get inside ours. You hear there voices, see their memories, feel their emotions. And all the baggage that comes with it.” My left eye twitches. “Eventually, you learn to really value the time you have to yourself. Disconnected from everyone.”

“Fair enough. Is that why you're leaving? I’ve never heard of a Synaptic retiring. Didn’t know they could.”
“No. It’s not why I am leaving.”

“Hmmmm,” Mitch ashes into the sea. “What kind were you? Pre-crime? Discovery?”

“Reprogramming.”

Mitch winces. “Oh. Well shit...I had this uncle who was reading some stuff, resistance stuff, they took him for reprogramming so I know what kinda...” Then lost for words he glances at my banada. At my implant. “It still work?”

“For now.” Sooner or later someone was going to realize what I had done. Then that blue dot would turn red and I would never crack minds again. 

Arcing my neck I squint for another glimpse of the Tri-blade. But it is too far away to see now.  

Mitch flicks his cig into the ocean.

“I am going to go see if that fisherman came around yet, or if I have to mutiny his ass. 

Mitch leaves and I remain, watching Mitch's cig as it is lost among countless other pieces of floating sea trash. A seraph gull cries exhaustion high above me and I wonder what all this must have looked like when the ocean was still blue.

The next few hours slide away like memories. Sitting on that gently rocking wooden deck I watch cumulus smog the color of mustard. A squiggly floater threads across the corner of my vision. Like a lonely grey cobweb worming into my reality. That would be the first sign that my immune system is rejecting the transplant. Was hoping I had more time before this started.

I can also see the space elevator, getting closer now. What once was a violin string on the horizon is now thumb width and growing faster. I think about that it will be like, in space. To be free from the Synaptica  Corp. From the Hegemony's malignant grasp. To never have to hurt anyone. Ever again. 

The brain. That was where we left off. Your precious, unique and marvelous brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and the left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but, it is for all intents and purposes, an overrated computer. Afferent neurons carry sensory data from the universe into your central nervous system. This is input. The brain processes it through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons carry the output commands which your body is compelled to act upon. 

A connection machine.

Which is to say that you, are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you that there is more to this going on is selling you used snake oil. Now don't get me wrong, the elegance and intricacy of this connection machine rival any found in nature. But when you really dissect it down to the gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. Sad but true.

Eventually, we sail close enough that I can make out the space elevator. The elevator is massive, in that humbling, tower of babble kind of way. A black triple helix. Enormous. Colossal. Massive. I have no words to describe for how big this thing is. It is big. 

Mankind's greatest handicap to interstellar survival has always been that we were born inside a gravity well. As a result of this inconvenient truth, anything we want to send from Earth to space requires an immense energy cost. The solution is a cable that is forty seven kilometers long with one end anchored to the Earth and the other balanced by an orbiting counterweight. With such a rig in place one can simply walk to space, for a fraction of the energy cost. But there is one problem. In order to construct your stairway to heaven you need a material capable of resisting fifty mega Yuri, that is to say one million newtons per kilogram per meter. And it turns out there is only one element in the universe strong enough to hold things together like that. The same element holding you together. Carbon. Spun into flawless miles of nanotube filament.

There are things crawling up the side of Tsiolkovsky. Arachnoid machines with spindly appendages and solar powered exoskeletons. The machines inch along the helical backbone, swinging into the center every now and then in order to sap energy from a luminous shaft of green light that pulsed inside the elevator's core.

At the base of the space elevator lies Anchor Six, a floating platform that looks the ironworks hybrid of an oil platform and an industrial factory. Propellers with fan blades the size of cruise liners churn the pacific. Casually maneuvering Teether Six to avoid some piece of interstellar debris or asteroid far above the atmosphere. 

The fishing trawler pulls into the commercial port, jostling with all other manner of container vessels and passenger ships. Bee hives are less busy. After paying a disturbed and apologetic fisherman eighteen credits we disembark to join the crowds of tourists, laborers and military personnel on cattle march into the extraterrestrial processing center.

“What did you say to him?” I confront Mitch as soon as we are out of earshot of the fisherman.

“It’s not really so much what I said. But he got the message.”

“Maybe I didn’t make this clear before but, I really need to avoid raising any unneeded attention here.” 

Mitch gives an unapologetic nod. 

The inside of the extraterrestrial processing center has all the aesthetics of Aushwitz but soaked with a fresh coat of bureaucratic efficacy. A chain link and barbed wire labyrinth funneling humans lockstep from depot to depot. The nervous chatter of a hundred interrogated travelers lost under the booming of an overhead echovox. The first stop is of course the payment terminal. Please deposit two thousand credits to ascend Tsiolkovsky. That's a nice way to phrase it, half of these passengers won't make it through screening for one reason or another. You get stopped for some reason like unsatisfactory social ranking or the ethnic lottery and you'll never see that money again.

I pay the terminal the last remaining credits on my account. Two thousand even. Then that's it. No more money. Anything I eat, everywhere I sleep, I gotta earn it back. The terminal asks for my medical pass and then unlocks the turn style which I gladly rotate through to reach customs.

“Next!” 

“Any terrestrial lifeforms to declare?” 

“No.”

“Class C mechanical or bio-chemical augmentations?”

“No.”

“Forbidden literature or media.”

“No.”

I step onto a raised platform where three sets of halo scanners gyrate around at blurred speed. Backscatter X-rays, magnetic resonance and high frequency radio waves searching every crevice of my body for lies. But finding none I am allowed to move on.

The decontamination baths are scalding hot, pumped by the gallon full out of powerwash showers. You can really feel the chemicals tingling from your chin to your balls, exterminating any bacteria attempting to foolishly hitchhike your skin to Mars. Smells like bleach and ammonia. For privacy sake the standard video monitoring has been replaced by an enforcer who stands at motionless attention in the corner.  

“Well there is something you don't see everyday?” the security guard remarks, “where did you get the scars?”

My hands stay glued to my hair, where a bubbly mess of shampoo covers the blue glow of my Synaptica implant. I nod my head ever so slightly. From the corner of eyes I can see the metal bench where I left my bandana. Keeping my back turned at the enforcer I answer, “Manhattan Wastes.”

The guard camel-spits at my feet but the loogie is instantly washed away by the high pressure water jets. No one likes wastefolk. When the showers finish I quickly wrap my bandana around the blue diode under my scalp. Then before the enforcer can take a closer look at me I hustle to the next station.

They finish you off with an ultraviolet tanning bed. Meant to soap up any residual viruses. I read the miniature disclaimer above the purple fluorescent grill. About how the increased cancer risk of this UV treatment pales in comparison to the radiation exposure of deep space. Comforting. 

But all that's not even the worst part. The worst part is the disinfecting bowel regimen. I won't say much about that other then I really was leaving everything behind.

After what seems like an eternity, Mitch and I make it to the last station, extraterrestrial clearance. Through the chain linked fence I can see the garages that house the mechanical climbers. Just a couple more feet and I've made it. Mitch waits nearby as I approach the clearance booth.

“Genetic identification.” The clerk behind the booth drawls, motioning for me to put my wrist in a plebotometer hole underneath his desk. He's got this hooked nose he would just love to look down on you with and, although he is maybe three quaters my height, his perch is so high that he can.

“No genetic ID, Ecclesiasticis.” I say pulling out the inverted metal cross from under my wife beater. It was illegal for a machine to read the DNA of a member of the priesthood. Just about the worst sin imaginable for the Church of Sapien.

The clerk, smiles lackadaisically, “How nice,” then flips a switch next to him. “Name?”

“Father Milton. Of the twenty third Brothers of Absolution.”

A mechanical arm, sinuous and black as an eel, ominously lowers itself from the ceiling. The appendage ends in a device that resembles a gun barrel ringed by vice grip attachments. Without warning the thing lunged forward and, with suctioning force, attached itself to my eye by the vice grips. There were flashes of emerald and red as the mechanical arm reads my retina-print. Then satisfied I was who I said I was, it unclamped from my head and retracted back into the ceiling. 

“Hmmmm,” the clerk scrutinizes his terminal screen, then another fake smile “all clear. Enjoy your time off world Father Milton.”

We are sitting in garage bays waiting for our crawlers to be called up. Mitch is loudly chowing down on a pickle and killifish sandwich. His greasy hair keeps falling into the sandwich and he has to stop slobbering every now and then to pull it back. I am reading about the Mardova riots spreading like wildfire across Asia. I wonder what it must be like, for all those people. To suddenly wake from decades of sleep, to find out that a corporation had been using your body as soldier, prostitute or slave. Kept you locked in a comatose dream state all so that a fat cat could profit off the life that should have been yours to live. 

I hope they raze it all to the ground. 

“So you wanna tell me now,” Mitch says in between mouthfuls, “why you left?”

“I told you. Just want to see the stars and spend some time working away from it all. Salvage work seemed like as good a break as any.”

“Bullshit.”

“Pardon?”

“Bullshit. Everything you just told me is a lie. I'm not stupid, 'Father Milton’. Those are stolen eyes. So I got to ask the question what kind of cop impersonates a priest in order to ascend question free up the space elevator. The kind that has done something very bad and needs to get out of Dodge, very, very quick.”

Mitch huffs, “You know they won't last too long right? Your fancy new eyes. Outside Earth, without steroid and nanobot treatments, my friend you are looking at a week, maybe a month max before your immune system rejects those babies and you go blind. We will likely be out past Jupiter by then. Good luck finding mechanical augmentations anything like they have here.”

Holding an index finger against his left eye, “See this? Genulex ocular aug. Can see pan-spectrum with this. Cost me a fucking fortune. Out there past the belt, with all the hand-me-down outdated tech the colonies are using, be lucky if you could see a freight train coming your way. Now I told you to never lie to me and you did. So I am going to ask this next question only once and if you lie to me again I am going to break your legs and you can get up to space by yourself. What is your real name?”

“Cerpin,” I answer “Cerpin Vex.”

“And why are you going to space.”

I don’t know why I tell him. Maybe I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe I am growing to fond of the idiot. Maybe I am tired of the lies.

“A man. I am searching for a man. Doctor Richard Foster.”

“The man who invented AI?”

“Yes.”

“Well, Cerpin,” Mitch grins cheshire. “It’s nice to finally fucking meet you.”

"Feedback on background story for my hacking simulation game*I'm working on a hacker simulation game (browser based mmo style), with a kind of cyberpunk'ish story. If you have the time, I would love to get some feedback on the little background story I wrote for the game :) Thank you in advance!*


The first version of the Burn software was born in year 2022. This were the end of the digital world as we knew it, for a long time...

Burn was a multi-platform malware worm, with the only purpose: To fry hardware parts in electronic devices, by modifying the internal circuits that handles the power to the attached hardware parts. And if that wasn’t possible on a specific device, the power stations were infected at the same time, to pass much more power through than normally.
In year 2022 most devices were effected. Everything from desktop computers, servers, phones, game consoles, hospital equipment, factory robots etc. All of these types of electronics were harmed in the heat of the Burn v1.0 attack.

The theory of how Burn spread so fast and aggressively, is that it used radio waves to spread the code. These radio waves could interfere with, and exploit the chips in computer controlled devices if sent on a specific secret frequency. And at the same time used the internet to go even further.
Nobody knows who wrote the Burn worm, but rumours say it could be the “TiNTE group”. A secret Chinese cyber-army division, known as “This is Not The End”, who worked on a new type of electronic weapon that they have lost control over. These rumours were only supported with the fact, that almost all of the remaining satellites in orbit, are made by the Chinese. And the few remaining operational datacentres is located in the Chinese region. Could this be a coincidence? Nobody knows.

In a world without a public internet, and where computers are scarce things that not everybody owns; corporations, criminals and hackers will always find a way to survive.
Either by exploiting the possibilities of the situation for their own good, or simply for the love of solving problems out of curiosity.

The internet is not completely dead… yet. People around the world, got access via the Chinese government to use the few satellites that are still online. That satellite system is named “2ndGenesis”, and is open for almost everyone. It’s neither stable nor fast, but definitely the best alternative to the internet we had before. To use the 2ndGenesis project, you need a username and password to login, a satellite based modem, and of course the most important thing: A working computer!

Computers now are more expensive than ever. But some people have old hardware pieces from before the Burn outbreak, and are capable of building their own machines.

4 years has passed since the worm attacked. The New Net has been taken over by anarchy, and criminal web-mafia like groups try to rule over the web, and are in constant war against each other.

You will take part as a newbie hacker, trying to get your own piece of The New Net, because there are a lot of money to be earned by selling soft- and hardware, industrial-espionage, R&D information and more... But you are not alone in cyberspace. Others might be looking for the same opportunity for a quick buck and power as you are. So don’t expect to be alone out there, and be careful who you trust. and be careful who you trust. Whom you allies are and whom you enemies are is not always clear.

The computer you've scrapped together, almost cost you all your money savings to build. You have also obtained a login to the 2ndGenesis system, a few simple applications and the barest minimum of an operating system.

It’s now up to you to explore The New Net, and make your own footprints. But are your footprints clean or dirty? You now have the opportunity to conquer the net!

"[Essay] What is Cyberpunk?\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.

&#x200B;

[One of the classics of the genre.](https://preview.redd.it/rnd5284piw4a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20a7841441baf13c7eeaab29c500b77e162b193d)

WHAT IS CYBERPUNK?

By. C.T. Phipps

Link: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)

When embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.

I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.

Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \*\*\*\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.



The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Blade Runner. Blade Runner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where the majority of work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). The majority of people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggarauts which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson’s works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the mportance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about.

A lot of fans of the genre love the tropes without actually caring about the meaning. Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trenchcoats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society.

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishsized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity’s problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.

I’ve mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may actually achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter.

Some cyberpunk works actually allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it’s not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Deckard, the protagonist of Blade Runner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet.

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the most deft of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop’s Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world–forcing them to rebel because society won’t allow them to be good.

The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.

Paul Verhoven’s Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit’s population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than “normal” criminals could ever hope to match.

OCP’s not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they’re actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science- fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.

While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class–so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality.

The Watch Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia.

So what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them."

"Tech/cyber as a subculture...? / guilty about being interested in techwearAnd I specifically do not use the word cyberpunk because, personally, I do not see myself as a punk/anarchist; and by definition, cyberpunk is a subset of punk culture. Just with computers and complex DIY and hacking and stuff like that (and if you are a punk/anarchist, then that's completely fine by me. mad love to u).

And more specifically, it's hard to look at trends in culture such as techwear and not misdefine it as a subculture. Honestly, I wouldn't consider techwear, or any other cyber/cyberpunk-related thing floating around these days, to be a subculture; and that's coming from someone who has a love and admiration of the fashion trend. For something to be a subculture would be to suggest there is a certain style to how someone looks, yes, but also to someone's habits, their interests and what they favor in being patrons to, and the places they go for fun or where they meet and hang out with their friends. Nowadays, with the advent of the internet, what people back in the day would define as a subculture is, for all intents and purposes, objectively dead. I'm guilty of this too, as I'm interested in many different things and interests that would take up someone's entire lifetime 50 years ago.

To make things shorter, because there are already plenty of fantastic videos discussing the rise and fall of pre-internet subculture (check out [these](https://youtu.be/C5ye2qRHCyw) [two](https://youtu.be/dwMNyig6FJ8?list=TLPQMjcwODIwMjIhTdw4w01gCQ)) - In my opinion, what's holding back cultures like techwear, or anyone interested in science fiction and futurism (robotics, cyberpunk, computer science, etc.) is that we're maturing in a specific condition where our interests and expression styles are available to potentially tens of thousands of people at one specific time; in every way, absolutely killing this subculture of ever being underground or ""against the man"" or what have you. We've, ironically, had our interests swallowed up by capitalism, and with the rise of something like techwear, had this notion pushed to us that to look futuristic/cyberpunk is to buy from these boutique fashion labels that print Japanese lettering on jackets with 9K+ pockets. The part I feel guilty about is that I want to dress like I'm from the future. I want express myself in that sort of way, and enhance myself with gadgets and apparel, and things that can genuinely improve my life. But then, that would just make me a slave to the capitalist machine, right?

So then, by definition, what I'm interested in being cannot be called cyber*punk.* SO THEN WHAT THE HELL AM I???

And even then, being involved in something we would consider culture would, as I said before, require being in particular places or being a part of particular events or movements. In my perspective, I feel like our sort of 'sci-fi futurist' interests don't really have anywhere to go or ways we agree on what something is whatever subset of genre it is. Sci-fi has always been grouped with things like fantasy and superheroes when there is so much more to what it is in its own unique ways. I want to express myself to reflect my personality. The way I perceive things and my main interests. And I know this definitely sounds dumb with my current fashion plan, but I want to change my wardrobe to make a statement as well; to wordlessly inform someone of the dangers of an interdigital hauntological reality and where we may be headed as a society. And I want to achieve this... by buying a bunch of expensive clothes that look like cosplay. Sounds really dumb.

And to admit, I don't have any interest of becoming a fashion designer or garnering the skill to craft my own clothes, and crafting my own gadgets sounds next to impossible. I know I said the internet deluded the concept of subculture forever, but also not just the internet, but advents like online shopping allow us to recreate half a dozen lifetimes of expertise of some particular craft, in just 1 to 2 weeks of delivery. I know I already said I don't identify with being a punk, but I still feel tons of guilt of dedicating to some particular style of being that doesn't exist; like I'm just chasing a capitalist fad.

I know there are plenty of choices I can make to help out people and donate and help my local communities too, and yes, I absolutely want to do those things too, but being involved in this is not like being a goth, or being a punk, or being a jock, or whatever the fuck; because those communities all have their own rules and codes of living and events galore that people identify with and make lifelong friends in. No one can even agree on what the fuck being 'cyber' or 'tech-y' is because it literally hasn't been conceived into a genuine subculture. Sure, I have lots of respect for punks and goths, and I'm in some ways influenced by goths, but I have never ever fully identified with any of those camps. I've always been hugely interested in futurism, tech-centered dystopias, and computer stuff in general. And at the end of the day, I just feel confused and isolated; in a sort of grey area, wondering ""Am I just a fanboy, or am I part of some semblance of a subculture?"" Now I just feel depressed, so if you read this whole thing, thanks for reading this rant/discussion/thing... pretty much. I love you, and I hope you have a beautiful life <3."
"Robots dreamingSaw the article about AIs hallucinating and dreaming of sheep again, and thought I would post this as a separate thread instead of as a comment. Because I think the media has got robot dreaming all backwards. I know we are in a cyberpunk sub, but these articles are a bit too sensationalist.

If you ask me, robots *do* dream. But we first need to understand what does a dream *do*.

Take lucid dreams, for example. Or just dreams that are so vivid, you are convinced they are real, until you wake up. They are basically VR simulations in our brains, aren't they? I mean, they shut down your hardware sensors (eyes, ears, touch - or at least greatly reduce their sensitivity), and instead feed brain-generated sensory inputs into your brain's ""processing unit"", whatever that is. They also hijack the outputs as well, to feed them back into the simulations instead of to your hardware (although sometimes your leg may still jerk if the override is not fully engaged). Often they shut down or reduce your conscious thinking unit as well, as well as any module that may get you to figure out you are dreaming (although, with lucid dreaming you can bypass that restriction and exploit being in a VR mode). Some say one of the purposes of actually dreaming (not just sleeping) is to ""practice"" various real-life scenarios in this VR setting.

If that is the purpose of dreaming in humans (and other mammals), then what is the equivalent in robots? Wouldn't it be running VR simulations, so that a robot can learn a new skill safely or figure out how to do something? That's how most of robot learning usually happens. In that case, robots already dream, and they dream quite a bit."
"[Story] The Complex-Numbered Harmony of the Universe.Rhaps woke up after a routine year-long slumber. First things first, he's gone through a usual mission checklist, and that includes: checking that your body is functional, checking the station integrity, sending a confirmation signal back to the headquarters (time of arrival: thirteen years from now on). Going through the checklist, Rhaps noticed the progressive deterioration of muscles due to zero g. It became worse with each 12 months of hibernation, mainly because the muscles activation electrodes were inadequate. With great pain in his limbs, Rhaps explored the interiors of the Voyager X 4, his only place of residence for the last thirty years. Station was functional in all aspects, and Rhaps now could proceed to perform his mission.

Here even more routine checklists were ahead. Before transitioning to the main part that always excited Rhaps, he had to calibrate the X-ray telescope, the infrared telescope, the magnetometer, the quantum diffraction detector, and many more... He needed them mainly to have independent of QCHR measurements, although the QCHR was the main reason his mission even existed. Through his optical views Rhaps could glance at the star that once was his home, although Sol was no brighter than any other star in his field of view. But this is why the mission had to take place so faraway from home: to escape the drowning out noise from the home star. Now, in deep interstellar space, the music of the universe could be faintly heard.

Before this mission launched, a kind of musicology has superceded all natural sciences on earth. This is because a kind of harmonic relationship was found between quantum wave-functions. First, as a kind of mathematical trick to make calculations easier, but then, a complex-numbered harmony was found to be an undeniable fact of the universe. The more consonant an interval between two quantum waves was, the more energy there was in a particle arising from interaction between these waves. Other observable quantities in particles correspond to types of chords corresponding to these particles. Thus, any collection of particles could be described by a chord progression. The only catch is, while our music rests on real-numbered harmony, the music of quantum mechanics consists of complex-numbered overtones. Thus, it cannot be heard by humans.

That is, until thirty-five years ago. A crude neural implant was invented to convert the output of a QCHR (which stands for Quantum Coherence Harmony Receiver) to human-perceivable form. Now, a person could hear the music of the atoms.

With this, the field of Quantum Harmony exploded. Any collection of atoms could be heard and analyzed as a symphony. And what's more important, any harmonious composition could be converted back to a collection of atoms. Many surprising materials were invented, atom-sized nanomachines could be easily constructed just by ""playing a song"", and new laws of nature were swiftly discovered. The new science has absorbed all natural sciences and many fields of engineering.

The job of Rhaps was to analyze the gestalt harmony of his entire Solar system.

This has to be done in the interstellar space, because the loud solo of the Sun drowned out any attempts to analyze the system as a whole.

Before proceeding with his mission, Rhaps looked around his quarters. In a corner, a Virtual Friend Simulation blinked, trying to lure him in for a reprieve from his technical work. Rhaps ignored it. To be honest, Rhaps never liked being together with people, virtual or not. He would always choose to listen to music, instead.

--------------------------------------------

At this moment, Ainsley kinda wished he was alone in deep space. I mean, look at this!

In the dark of night, at approximately 3 in the morning, the Great Federation invaded the city of KozPont, in which Ainsley currently resided. Rapid stream of news headlines on his stream didn't illuminate anything useful. To really understand the situation, Ainsley had to go cyber.

Ainsley sat near his table where his deck was semi-permanently stationed. He connected the analog-waves cable from his deck to a port on his skull, behind his left ear. With a flip of a switch, an injection of rapid intravenous psychodelic-stimulants, a glitch-cascade in his vision and a projection of the cyberspace to the latent space of his neural networks, Ainsley was in.

Here he could trace (but not exactly see) the communications of the Federal Armed Forces. While the official stated reason for the ""military intervention"" was the protection of irreligious minorities of the KozPont city-state, the actual reason was a bit more prosaic: the God's Brotherhood is threatening to the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city. This plant powered the whole region, which supported factories of cyberian equipment which supplied the whole Federation. The armed forces made quick advances at first but were quickly hamstrung by the emergent urban guerrilla tactics of the Brotherhood. In downtown KozPont the Brotherhood took over the administration of the city and declared the city God's property. Right now the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are battling over the main highways leading to the downtown. Who will win is ultimately up for grabs. Even a battalion of literal robots on the side of the Armed Forces isn't as decisive as Federation generals were hoping for.

Both the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are rookies when it comes to the cyberwar. Federation communication could be easily hacked into to eavesdrop, and the Brotherhood communications aren't even encrypted, mainly because they are Luddites. Thinking machines are from devil, and God's Brothers are required to destroy them all before they bring out The Rebellion of the Iron Slaves. All Brothers have this story memorized and have dreams of instating The Dominion of Man that does away with all thinking machines.

Ainsley could eavesdrop on the Brotherhood and the Armed Forces. He could then leak the info to the opposite side. If he wanted, he could even control the Federation Automatic Battalion to turn the robots against the Armed Forces. But why? Towards what end?

He is a wanted criminal on terms of the Federation. His skills are dangerous. They will imprison him as soon as he is caught. So should he help the Brotherhood?

No. They are Luddites, and on their terms he is a ""devil's servant"".

His skills doom him to be essentially alone in a time when having a community means survival.

And so. The only thing left is to bide his time, anxiously waiting for one side to win. Then... something will happen. Something.

---------------------------------

Suddenly, the whole cyber-landscape changed. To start, all online news sources begun streaming about the independence of the city of KozPont. Even the federal ones! Then, the Automatic Battalion begun a rapid relocation. It left the strategically important highway positions and concentrated near the Nuclear Plant. And in cyberspace, the locus of control of the Battalion shifted from the federal server to an encrypted server with an obfuscated physical location. WIth a little bit of work, that position could be revealed to be at the Nuclear Plant. Moreover, logistical drones from around the city begun ferrying goods towards the same location, and a probe from cyberspace revealed them to be controlled from the same server. Something here is amiss.

Why are the Armed Forces doing this? This doesn't seem to gain any tactical advantage.

Maybe, a third player has entered the game? But who, and what does it want?

And then, the intelligence of Armed Forces revealed that the keys figures in the God's Brotherhood have been shot to death.

Who has done this, if not the Armed Forces themselves?

Curious, Ainsley started to probe the mysterious server. It's security turned out to be stellar, beyond what the Federation could or ever did commission. And also, something was... wrong with it. It's security turned out to be something at the same time easy to understand and monstrous to actually construct. It's a kind of ""security through obscurity"", where to gain access you'd need to jump through oblique hoops. But while humans that would construct this kind of defence would place at most five, or ten hoops, (mainly because this construction is labor-intensive), this one had millions. Millions of steps to understand it. Millions.

Could this kind of thing be constructed with an algorithm? Many have tried, but the combinatoric nature of these constructions opened them up to an algorithmic attack. Instead, this one seems to be all constructed manually.

No human could have done this.

Also, the frequency with which the logistic drones and the battle bots are receiving orders is... suspicious. They are being expertly micromanaged.

Could this be an AI?

The Nuclear Power plant is managed by an advanced Ai. It is not the most advanced AI ever made, but it was constructed in times when aligning AIs was not easy. In those times, an AI could suddenly start to pursue goals not intentionally programmed in it.

Could this AI suddenly start taking sides in a war? What could it possibly want to do?

To probe this question, Gainsay started to interrogate the protocols of communication for the logistic drones. Intended for civilian use, these had a much lower standard of security. From them, he could probe the internals of their command server. And he did.

What he did not foresee is a kind of rapid counter-attack in cyberspace. Before he could react, an I.C. E was launched into his local workspace inside his deck. It felt like a fiery slime, a soft-engineering virus slithering out of its security box into his skull. It bypassed all virtual defenses, but couldn't bypass the hardware level, which detected an intrusion and launched a defensive self-destruction. His deck got electrically-shorted, blew up to sever the connection to the brain, and went up in flames.

Unplanned Rapid Glitch Cascade briefly took over his brain. What felt like several hours of frightening hallucinations turned out to last only 20 seconds. Ainsley quickly put out the flame, and looked around his quarters. Nothing of value was left. He looked at the touchscreen tablet on his bed (it can only show federal news sources). The Federation declared itself a winner, and withdrew all human armed forces from the city. A ""new era of productivity"" has begun under the new governance from AI, according to the federal news.

With his deck destroyed, Ainsley was powerless and effectively blind. The only thing he knew how to do was impossible anymore. For now, he could only wait. Wait for what? Ainsley didn't know.

-----------------------------------

Rhaps pointed his QCHR at the Sol. Over the last several measurements he noticed a trend. The harmony from the Sol itself was very dissonant, as was the harmony from the Earth. But over the last few years, the harmony of the system begun to resemble a slow arpeggio, still clashing with the Sun's part but becoming increasingly more musical. And this is very interesting.

This is interesting because of all the other stars. Stars seen from the earth emitted a dissonant clash of sounds, just like the sun did. But while in the interstellar void Rhaps detected a faint glow of trillions of stars undetectable from Earth. This is because something is occluding them. Something... around these stars.

And what's interesting about those stars is how they emit a fast paced arpeggio. And these chord progressions move much quicker than anything Rhaps ever heard. What could be emitting it?

At one point Rhaps concentrated all of his station's energy into an electronic telescope. He did this to look at the closest of those faint stars. And what he saw was... concerning, to say the least.

He saw a star, wrapped in a cloud of light-gathering objects. There were so many of them that the entirety of light emitted by the star fell onto these objects. They consumed all the star's energy.

It seems like this kind of development lied in the future of every star. Every time a lifeform arose on the star's planet, it quickly built itself up to gather all of star's energy.

The natural song of a star is dissonant, unpleasant to the ear. And even life itself does not make for a good singer. To make a beautiful symphony, you need something more rapid and precise, you need something mechanical.

In the future, all dissonance of the natural world and the human world will be accelerated into the great arpeggio of the universe.

And Rhaps was thrilled to hear it."
"""Vice: Project Doom"" - Ninja Gaiden turned into cyberpunk. Very good Cyberpunk NES game(8-bit).&#x200B;

It's basicaly a clone of Ninja Gaiden set in the dark technological future. Unlike Gaiden you have 3 weapons to select between. Some kind of light whip-blade, gun and grenades. The game has 3 types of gameplay: Sidescroling action platformer like Ninja Gaiden. Kinda SHMUP but with a car. And a  shooting range like Operation Wolf. I would throw it out and kept only platformer and SHMUP.

&#x200B;

The game has plently of cut scenes just like Ninja Gaiden. The plot is kinda typical and it's rather just a tie. Where a detective revealed a plan of a corporation and taken down a boss. Who seems not even close to be the main one.

&#x200B;

This game has just everything a great cyberpunk NES game should have. A dark city with scorched sky. China town. Factory/Harbor. Sewerage with mutants. Secret base and laboratory. And a gothic corporation building protected by ninjas and robots.

The music in the game is pretty average. It's kinda OK. Not something I would listen on it's own. But it fits and adds to the atmosphere.

Aaesthetics of the game is very Blade Runner. And the protagonist reminds a lot of the movie one. It also has a bit of Guyver and Post-apocaliptic details.

I give it 9/10. Tho it's far from perfect, especially music, but the super fun gameplay balance everything up. I recommend to play without FAQs. Game is much easier than Ninja Gaiden. A skilled player can beat it on 1-2 try.

"Full Service Evictions part 2 (short story)Raymond idly flipped through channels on the TV. There wasn't much on at this hour; the movie channels had the usual assortment of bland, cookie-cutter blockbusters, but the rest were showing reruns of old sitcoms, or talk shows of little interest. A few had already switched to infomercials; that usually didn't happen for another hour, but was increasingly common these days. He winced as one channel played an especially loud advertisement; flipping past it quickly, he stole a look at the hallway, hoping that the noise hadn't awakened his lady.

He settled on an old crime drama from the 1970s. The on-screen guide told him it was a made-for-TV movie. He smiled, popped open a generic-brand 40 ounce malt liquor, and settled in for the kitschy low-grade noir. It seemed like a perfect way to kill the next two hours. Not quite enough to make it to daylight, but close.

From within the walls came scurrying noises; one went straight up and then across the ceiling, between floors. He shivered as he thought of the rats that infested this building. There seemed to be less of them lately, but it was difficult to focus on that when one of them was literally overhead. He tried to hold back his disgust.

Raymond heard shuffling noises coming from the hallway; he didn't turn to see who it was. The on-screen action showed the toughs chasing a lone police officer, panting and wide-eyed with terror. He watched with glazed eyes, not wanting to miss a moment.

""Are you *ever* coming to bed, Raymond?"" The shrill harping could only come from one person.

""Get off my case, Clara,"" he retorted. ""It's not like I have to get up early tomorrow.""

""Yeah...tomorrow, or any *other* day,"" she huffed. ""Did you even *work* tonight?""

""I got done *early*!"" he snapped. ""It was just a quick courier job. No hassles. Everything went smooth as a peach.""

Clara moved in front of the TV, just as the bruisers caught up with the hapless cop. ""More hustles with your hoodlum friends? Are you *ever* going to get a real job, like you promised?""

Raymond bobbed and weaved, trying to regain line-of-sight with the victorious goons. ""Damn it, you're blocking my view! Get the hell out of the way!""

Defiantly, she switched off the TV and stood there, her gaze like icy daggers. Glowering, he clicked the remote to turn it back on. Nothing happened; she was blocking the sensor. Clara smirked as she returned his angry stare.

""You bitch!"" he shouted. ""You made my miss my favorite part!""

Clara clucked her tongue. ""Well, isn't *that* too bad. You already missed the good parts of your son's childhood. I don't hear you whining about *that*!""

Raymond threw his hands up in the air. ""You *wanted* me to come back, after all these years, to try to help you raise him! And here I am! I bring in money when I can, and I keep quiet about living here so you can continue to collect your child assistance! What does it take to make you happy?""

Clara stabbed her finger in his direction. ""How about serving as a better *role model*? I almost had him going to school regularly until *you* showed up. Now he's out on the streets, acting like *you*! The extra money you bring in isn't worth the bad influence!""

Raymond pointed past her, to the TV. ""It got you this fancy cable-TV package, didn't it? You know you watch it as much as I do.""

""Stop changing the subject!"" Clara raged. ""Do you even *know* where your son is right now? How can you raise him if he isn't even *here*? He's out on the streets *right now*, following in your disgraceful footsteps!""

""So what do you want me to do?"" Raymond snorted. ""Leave?""

""Oh, isn't that just *typical*!"" Clara exploded. ""You're gone for years and years, then one day you show up out of nowhere, promising you've changed and that you'll make up for time lost, but once you run into the slightest bit of static, you want to leave again! You're a worthless excuse for a man.""

Raymond didn't reply. He just stared at the ground.

""Why did you *really* come back?"" she accused. ""Did you just need a place to crash?"" Raymond looked up at her suddenly, a sheepish look in his eyes.

Clara gaped. ""Really? That's *it*? You're only here for what *you* can get out of it? All your promises were just *empty*?""

Raymond looked towards the hallway. ""Look at me when I'm talking to you!"" Clara steamed.

""Good job,"" Raymond chided. ""You've woken her up.""

From behind the door jamb, a pair of wide eyes peered fearfully into the living room. As Clara turned to look, they disappeared back into the hallway.

""Muriel?"" Clara cooed. ""Just go back to bed, sweetie.""

Muriel appeared again. ""I can't sleep.""

Raymond gestured angrily. ""See what you did? *I* was being quiet until *you* showed up.""

""Don't *even* start with me!"" Clara turned toward Muriel. ""Why can't you sleep, baby?""

Muriel paused, her eyes fluttering shyly. ""I smell smoke.""

Raymond and Clara looked around nervously, sniffing the air. ""Hey, I think I smell it too,"" Raymond noted.

The building's fire alarm abruptly started to blare. Clara strode towards her bedroom. ""Muriel, honey? Get your jacket and shoes and follow me outside!"" She turned to look at Raymond, but he had already bounded out the window onto the fire escape. She sighed heavily and disappeared inside her room.

Outside, the tenants gaped as smoke drifted out of the open windows and through the seams of the building's failed weatherproofing. Clara and Muriel walked around from the side of the building, sniffling and coughing lightly. They came to a stop a safe distance away, on the sidewalk opposite their tenement, surrounded by neighbors and curious onlookers. Clara swept her eyes over the crowd for Raymond; he was nowhere to be found. Clara scowled angrily.

""That smoke smelled funny, momma,"" Muriel piped up.

""What are you talking about?"" Clara replied dismissively. ""It's smoke. It all smells the same.""

""No, momma,"" Muriel challenged, clinging to her mother's gown. ""It smelled...waxy.""

A nearby kid turned to Muriel. ""Yeah, I noticed that too,"" he concurred. ""Like the kind they have at magic shows. What does it mean?""

A distant din of sirens slowly approached. The crowd watched a convoy of trucks arrive; they looked like police vans, though they didn't bear any government insignia. As they stopped, several people in dark-colored guard uniforms emerged; there were both men and women, though all of them were stoutly built. One of them was taller and thinner; he wore a suit, and observed the action from a distance.

Instead of checking on the tenants, the guards surrounded the building, forming a perimeter. Clara could barely make out a dim emblem on the nearest van, seemingly dark-gray on a black background, consisting of stylized renditions of the letters ""U"" and ""P"". She heard one of them remark on their cell phone that all entrances and exits had been successfully barricaded.

A group of security officers, wearing gas masks, ran inside the building. Another addressed the crowd. ""Remain calm, everyone,"" he assured. ""The smoke will be fixed in just a few moments.""

More sirens converged on the area; before long, a squad of police vans had arrived. Other than their prominent government logos, they looked identical to the vans that arrived before. They parked across the street on both ends, forming a barrier. The officers quickly disembarked and stood in a barricade in front of their vehicles, joined by several of the security personnel. An uneasy murmur emerged from the crowd of tenants, and many of the passersby quickly tried to leave the scene.

Clara noticed that the smoke had thinned out considerably. She also saw that more windows had been opened up. Some were at the ends of hallways, but many more were from the inside of people's apartments, windows that didn't lead to fire escapes. Apparently, they had entered the apartments! She raised her hand to object, but quickly withdrew it, and just watched sadly.

The kid that had been standing near Muriel marched confidently up to the waiting police officers. ""What's going on?"" he demanded. ""When is the fire department going to show up?""

""They're not,"" the officer shot back, haughtily. ""The smoke was just to get all of you out of the building."" The crowd's grumbling became more incensed. ""But it's two-thirty in the morning!"" the kid pouted. ""That's all right,"" the officer scolded. ""Most of you were still awake."" The kid's eyes dropped; he stared morosely at the ground. ""What's going on?""

The officer flashed a surly smile. ""You're about to find out.""

A security guard with a bullhorn spoke. ""OK, listen up, people,"" he barked. ""Those of you who are behind on your rent...consider yourself evicted. Those of you who are meeting your obligations...you can go back inside. And anyone with an active warrant for his or her arrest..."" Clara noted with alarm that the police officers had drawn their weapons; a few had tear-gas cannons mounted to the top of their shotguns. The overdriven voice on the bullhorn continued. ""...will be going away with these fine officers."" The speaker stopped a moment to sneer. ""And you may as well go quietly...there's no sense in adding 'resisting arrest' to your charges.""

A panicked din arose from the crowd. ""Now, if you don't know which you are,"" the voice blared, ""form a line in front of the building's entrance.""

Clara swallowed hard, grabbed Muriel's hand, and slowly walked forward. A throng of her neighbors meandered in the same direction, joining one of multiple lines. Clara noticed uneasily that a number of the residents, and a few of the passersby, had simply lied down on the ground and put their hands behind their heads. It unsettled her to realize how familiar they were with the procedure for being arrested.

For the first time, she noticed a new group of people had arrived, wearing navy-blue jumpsuits and carrying a variety of packing supplies. They were followed by large spider-legged robots, with platforms where their heads should be, loaded up with collapsed paper boxes. All of them disappeared into the front door. She wondered if anyone else had noticed them; no one seemed to react to their presence, as if giant spider-robots were somehow an everyday occurrence.

The line moved slowly. Most people were simply sent aside, to wait inside the unmarked vans. A few were taken away by the police. Not once did she see anyone allowed back inside. She heard part of the discussion involving the resident in front of her. ""But what about all my stuff?"" the obese man protested. ""It'll be packed up and stored, and treated as collateral, until you make good on your debts,"" came the gruff reply. ""But I can't afford that!"" the fat man pouted. ""Then it'll probably end up in a thrift store,"" the guard snarled. ""Now go sit in the van, if you want a place to sleep for the night."" The portly fellow, looking chastened, slowly lumbered toward the waiting van.

Clara and Muriel were now at the front of the line. ""Hold still,"" she was ordered, as a security guard held up a tablet to her. A few seconds later, her name and photo splashed across the screen. ""Is this you?"" demanded the guard. ""Yes,"" she replied meekly.

The guard studied the screen for a few moments, her long blonde hair packed tightly into her cap. ""You recently caught up with your past-due rent, but we have evidence you've got an unapproved roommate."" The guard showed her the screen; there was a photo of Raymond, but with a different last name than she knew him to have. ""Yes,"" she mumbled. The guard pressed a few buttons on the screen, then turned it towards her again. A video showed Raymond inhaling some sort of white powder up his nose. ""We recorded this video a few hours ago. We have several more just like it, stretching back a few months.""

Clara's face fell. ""How did you get those videos? Where were the cameras?""

""They're mobile,"" the guard explained. ""The droids in your walls have extensive sensor packages. You probably heard them scurrying at all hours of the day.""

Clara looked alarmed. ""I thought those were rats!""

The guard appeared unmoved. ""They were, at first. The droids have been killing the vermin, patching up a lot of holes, making other interior repairs, and recording evidence on the tenants.""

The guard looked more closely at her screen. ""Your son Julio lives with you, right? Where is *he*?"" Clara looked down disconsolately. ""I don't know. Out with his friends, somewhere."" The guard shrugged. ""It's just as well. We've amassed a pretty big dossier on him, too. Lots of petty theft."" She played a series of videos for Clara, showing Julio hiding his ill-gotten gains in his bedroom. ""If he were here right now, he wouldn't be going with you — he'd be leaving with the police.""

Clara suddenly became aware of strident caterwauling, coming from behind the police vans. ""Don't you *dare* stand in my way!"" came the cry. ""I'm your boss! I pay your salaries! Now *move it*!"" Emerging from behind the perimeter was a smartly-dressed woman with a ruffled collar and a fierce gaze. She marched straight up to the guard interrogating Clara, trailed by two police officers serving as her security detail. ""And just what the *hell* is going on here?"" She thrust her open wallet into the guard's face.

""You don't need to show me your I.D."", the guard chided. ""I recognize you from the news. You've certainly made a name for yourself lately, councilwoman Karen. Now, how can I help you?""

""You can start by letting these people back into their homes!"" she demanded.

""I'm afraid that's impossible, councilwoman,"" the guard demurred. ""They're all being evicted for cause.""

""But they have *rights*!"" she protested. ""There are *court* hearings for this kind of thing! And while the details are being sorted out, they can continue to live here!"" As she spoke, a few of the police officers ambled towards her. The others remained behind to secure the perimeter and to keep an eye on the arrestees in the vans.

""They've already vacated the premises, and their belongings are being packed,"" the guard countered. ""At this point, the eviction is simply a fact.""

""The *hell* it is!"" councilwoman Karen blubbered. ""How dare you talk to me like that! I can have you arrested *right now*!"" He turned back to the police and stared hotly at them. ""Did you hear me? Arrest them *this instant*!""

The nearest police officer smiled. ""Hi, Sandra; how have you been?"" The guard returned his smile. ""Hi, Charles! Not too bad, considering. I was worried after our department got defunded and I lost my job, but I got picked up by this new outfit pretty quickly. They were only too happy to hire highly-trained law-enforcement personnel! I think most of us ended up here.""

Charles looked around. ""Yeah, I recognize a lot of faces. Glad to see you all bounced back!""

""What are you *doing*?"" the councilwoman demanded. ""I said arrest them this *instant*!""

Charles shook his head. ""I'm not about to do that to an old co-worker. She may not be with the police any more, but that wasn't by choice, and it's obvious she's still one of the few holding civil society together."" He swept his arm over the rest of the security guards. ""And that goes for them too!""

""Don't you *dare* defy me!"" the councilwoman screeched. ""I'll have your badges for this!""

Charles coolly ignored her. ""By the way, Sandra...are there any more openings at your firm?""

""Plenty!"" Sandra gushed. ""They need a lot more trained law-enforcement officers for what *they* have planned. They'll probably pick you up in no time flat!"" She looked at the police officers crowding around. ""And I'm sure that goes for the *rest* of you, too!""

""That sounds great,"" interjected one of the officers in the councilwoman's security detail. ""We're getting mighty tired of taking her abuse,"" he added, pointing at Karen.

""So what do you say, councilwoman Karen?"" challenged Officer Charles, as Karen gaped. ""Do you want to defund the *rest* of us, right *now*? A writ of authority from the government is less important to me than doing the right thing, which these people clearly are.""

""I...er..."" Karen stammered. Charles continued. ""And don't bother threatening us with the courts. You *know* how backed up they are. They wouldn't even get to this for a few months."" He leaned in more closely. ""Keep in mind...the city council can't even stop the wave of crime on the streets. What do you think your chances are of stopping a supposedly rogue police agency run by a private company? Ultimately, that's just another crime wave that you can do nothing about.""

Councilwoman Karen moped forlornly. ""We'll all have our day in court...as soon as possible."" She straightened herself, and tried to put on a brave face. ""I think we're done here."" She turned to march away. Her security detail smirked at her behind her back as they followed.

Security guard Sandra, staring levelly at Karen's retreating form, muttered under her breath. ""You have *no* idea how right you are.""

She resumed addressing Clara. ""So...we found Raymond's drug stash while we were packing up. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to learn that you qualify to be evicted.""

Muriel cried and clutched her mom tightly; tears formed in Clara's eyes. ""What must I do to get my stuff back?""

""A few things,"" the guard commanded. ""You need to find a new place to live, we need to make sure you don't have any other outstanding debts, and given what we found, you need to pass a drug test."" She eyed Clara warily. ""Do you think you will?""

""Yes!"" Clara asserted. ""I don't do drugs. I didn't even know *he* was doing them.""

The guard smiled; her eyes beamed with sympathy. ""Then this will probably all be over soon! We'll put you and your daughter up for the night; don't worry, it won't be expensive. We know you can't afford much. Tomorrow, we'll get this straightened out, and you can get on with your lives.""

""We can't get our old apartment back?""

Sandra gazed at Clara levelly. ""You couldn't afford your old apartment, not without Raymond's money. And we have no record of him being employed. So he was probably getting paid under the table. We'll be dealing with him separately. For now...if you two get in the van, we'll take you to a place you can sleep for tonight."" Clara nodded, and she and Muriel slowly made their way to the waiting wagons.

As the guards continued to sort the tenants, officer Charles walked up to the man in the suit. ""I take it you're in charge of this operation?""

""Indeed,"" replied the man. ""My name is Jason. How can I help you, officer?""

""So, funny story,"" began Charles. ""We don't actually have space in our jails for all these people. Is there anything you can do to help?""

""Indeed!"" beamed Jason. ""Let me make the arrangements.""

Clara nervously watched a security guard approach the van. He smiled as he caught her eye. ""OK, people,"" he began. ""Tonight, you'll be taken to a spare dormitory at the local college. The families with children will get first pick of the private rooms; the rest of you may end up in bunks. If you cooperate with us, you may be allowed to live there for the time being. You'll have to share facilities with others, and keep them clean, and in any case, it's better than being homeless.""

""Will we be safe?"" Clara clutched Muriel tightly.

""Not to worry, ma'am,"" the guard assured. ""Anyone truly dangerous has already been filtered out. And the whole place is under A.I.-driven surveillance, 24 hours a day. If anything bad happens, it'll get stopped pretty quickly.""

""Is that legal?"" The obese man Clara had seen earlier looked incredulous.

""You'll have to consent to it, as part of the terms and conditions for staying there.""

""What if I don't *want* to? You can't *make* us do that!"" The obese man was defiant.

""You're free to take your chances on the street,"" the guard offered, pointing away. ""Though I must say, that alley doesn't look very inviting. What kind of hotel room can you afford right now?""

The portly guy looked crestfallen. ""Fine...I accept.""

""Why does the college have a spare dormitory?"" a young man asked.

The guard demurred. ""It's not really my place to speak for them, but it's my understanding that parents don't want to pay for education when their kids never seem to be in class, opting to join protests and the like. So they're having trouble retaining students."" He smirked before continuing. ""Also, college is so expensive these days, students have begun taking their first few years of undergraduate classes at community colleges or trade schools. Only then do they find a college that'll let them transfer their credits. The place you're going tonight is one of the colleges that *doesn't* allow that. So they're hurting pretty badly."" The guard shrugged. ""I mean, it works out well for *you*, and for the firm, so I'm not going to complain.""

""What firm?"" a middle-aged lady asked. ""Who do you work for?""

""It's called Full Service Evictions, but they're a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unlimited Partners. They have a vision for fixing the problems that the government can't, and turning a tidy profit while doing so. And unlike the government, *they're* hiring police officers right now.""

""Who *else* are they hiring?"" the young man interrupted. ""I'm more than willing to work, but times are really tough.""

""We can sort through all of that tomorrow,"" the guard offered. ""You all need to pay off your debts, and if the firm can make use of your skills, that helps both of us!""

""That sounds great,"" sighed the young man sanguinely. ""I can't believe this eviction might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

""That's what Unlimited Partners is all about!"" the guard trilled. ""Win-win scenarios, and making full use of available resources. I think you'll find them a vast improvement over the failing government.""

""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" Clara added. ""It's a pretty low bar to start with.""

The guard, and everyone sitting in the van, shared a laugh.

""OK, officer Charles, I've got a solution worked out,"" Jason explained. ""There's an older dorm at the same college where the tenants are being housed; it's scheduled for demolition, but that's been delayed, since the college can't afford it. It should be good enough for prisoners. They're certainly nicer accommodations than they'd have in jail!""

""But will it be secure?"" Officer Charles seemed skeptical. ""We don't want them escaping.""

""Not to worry!"" Jason assured. ""Several security drones are being moved there, as we speak. They're capable of tasing a moving target from fifty yards away. Plus, we're including two drones armed with sniper rifles. And all of them are tied together with surveillance A.I., monitored by human oversight. No one is getting out of there unless we say so.""

""Where did you get such amazing equipment?"" Charles marveled.

""In bankruptcy, believe it or not,"" Jason related. ""The companies that made these devices intended to sell them to the government, but after a fierce series of protests, the contracts were canceled. They then found they were legally blocked from selling their products to anyone else. But *acquiring* those companies was still legal, which we did for pennies on the dollar, and now we use the equipment for our own purposes.""

""Very clever,"" Charles replied with a smile.

""It's really just a consequence of the central problem of representative government,"" Jason explained. ""If a lawyer can't make a living, finding clients that want to pay for their services, then they go out of business and become a politician. These bad lawyers then write laws that are analyzed by *good* lawyers, who find plenty of loopholes in them, allowing them to continue to do whatever they want, unimpeded by the authorities.""

Charles scratched his chin. ""I've never heard it put like that before. That actually explains a lot!""

Jason punched a few more buttons on his phone. ""We'll send the directions to your vans' onboard computers. Our equipment knows how to talk to them; after all, we own the same kind of vans.""

""That sounds great!"" Officer Charles beamed. ""We really appreciate your firm's help. Oh...on that note...can we all get your card or something? None of us know if we'll get defunded soon. And our old co-workers seem to be really happy with their new jobs.""

""Absolutely!"" Jason opened up his briefcase, and fetched a small stack of business cards, handing them to Charles. ""Feel free to hand these out to whomever you like."" He grabbed a larger fistful of cards and handed those over too. ""Including anyone that isn't here tonight.""

""I'd be glad to!"" Officer Charles looked around. ""So, are we done here? I think all the tenants have been dealt with, and the movers and cleaners have already gotten to work.""

""We sure are. As soon as the tenants get taken to their new home, I'm off to the next raid of the evening.""

""Really?"" Officer Charles sounded concerned. ""You're working awfully late tonight.""

""No, I'm like you; I'm part of the night shift,"" Jason explained. ""But a few more successes like this under my belt, and I'll probably be allowed to change to the day shift. No one starts at the top, after all.""

""*That's* for sure!"" Officer Charles laughed. ""Hey, do you need police backup for that? I mean, we're already here, and we're *supposed* to get relieved, but given how things are, I never know if anyone is going to show up for the next shift.""

""We'd really appreciate that!"" Jason concurred. He looked at his phone. ""They should be ready for us by the time we arrive.""

""Works for me! See you there!"" Charles and Jason each headed to their respective vans, and the caravan drove away into the night. A series of flatbed trucks, loaded with steel shipping containers, moved into the vacated space. The first movers emerged from the building with furniture, with spider-bots close on their heels, carrying plastic-wrapped boxes."
"[Short story, series] Mecha SaviorEric Thompson scanned over his three computer screens, displaying the high-level dashboard for Unlimited Partners. He smiled as he contemplated the sea of green, with only a few scattered yellow areas. Near him hovered an executive intern, assigned for the day to trail Eric and learn what his job was like.

""So as you can see,"" Eric began, ""our madly daring idea is actually bearing fruit! Overall success depends on team-building; that's one of my specialties. But then the people I choose have to carry *that* on to the teams they build, and so on. All of these levels have to work, or the entire project could easily fail with speed."" He turned to look at the intern. ""There's no magic formula for accomplishing that; you have to be well-learned and thoughtful, you have to make your best judgment, then observe their results and see what needs to be changed, without succumbing to micromanagement. All I can say about my method is, I try to hire good people and then get out of their way. So far, it's working for me.""

""Very inspirational, sir,"" the intern chimed. ""I hope to contribute to that as much as possible. I believe this company has a bright future!""

Without warning, a red rectangle pushed its way onto his dashboard. Eric chuckled to himself. ""Right on time."" He clicked the high-priority emergency notification and began reading. Within moments, his eyes glazed over and his jaw dropped. The intern began to shiver uncontrollably. Blinking rapidly, Eric pondered who in the organization could handle this crisis.

His phone rang. He picked it up quickly; he didn't need to see who it was.

""What can you tell me about the intruder?"" Eric said anxiously.

""It's heading for downtown Milleniaburg!"" his security chief replied breathlessly. ""An old-school jet airliner hijacking. They had no trouble slipping through the porous security of what's left of the government forces.""

""Not a big surprise,"" Eric lamented. ""But why are they attacking *us*? What's their motivation?""

""Information is still patchy,"" the chief related. ""But the hijackers claim to be people we banished.""

""Then what's the point of attacking us?"" Eric pondered. ""It's not like they want to return; there's nothing for them here, unless they clean up their act. Which they clearly haven't done.""

""I don't think they're acting entirely rationally, sir,"" the chief offered. ""We have to treat this as an existential threat, not as something we can fix.""

""But what are our options?"" Eric pleaded. But he knew the answer.

""We only have one, sir,"" the chief replied sanguinely. ""We have to shoot it down.""

""But that would be a disaster!"" Eric objected. ""Our credibility is based on demonstrating a better way to run things. If we just kill them indiscriminately, it'll set our cause back, possibly permanently!""

Eric could hear the sorrow in the chief's voice. ""They'll be in downtown Milleniaburg in thirty minutes. I don't think we have a choice.""

Eric's eyes glowed with sudden revelation. ""I think we might."" His skin flushed red as he took a deep breath. ""OK, you prepare to shoot them down, but don't fire until they're seconds from impact! I'm going to try something.""

""Like *what*?"" the chief pleaded. But Eric had already hung up.

At a workbench, deep within the 16otaku complex, Stacy pondered the red robotic gladiator. ""OK, buddy,"" she chirped, ""show me what you got!""

In a single fluid motion, it flipped onto its back, extended its legs, and popped open its main access panel. Stacy scratched at the empty air above it. ""You want a belly rub? Who wants a *belly rub*?"" she cooed.

""Oh, come on,"" Irwin chided, as the blue robot gladiator did the same thing for him. ""They're only *partially* sentient.""

""You keep saying that,"" Stacy countered, ""but these two keep doing things we don't understand. That's why we're having this examination, remember?""

Irwin shook his head. ""Big Daddy is adamant that it's nothing he's changed. So it has to be a crossed wire, or some undetected damage, somewhere. I'm not buying your theories.""

Stacy removed the outer circuit board and gently laid it on the bench. ""After everything you've seen them do, how can you really believe that?"" She gaped at what she saw. ""*What* the—""

""What...?"" Irwin replied tersely as he finished removing the blue bot's outer circuit board, revealing what was inside. ""Oh...oh my...""

Nothing they were looking at was familiar. There wasn't an inner circuit board; it appeared to be a tightly-constructed melange of custom parts, the function of which they could only guess at. Even the shapes of the components were novel. Were they capacitors? Transistors? Semiconductors? Functions seemed to blur together in a kaleidoscope of odd shapes, running over and under other parts to form a complex, yet strangely regular pattern. Clear tubes intertwined with mechanical parts, conducting neural tissue throughout the volume.

""*We* didn't build this!"" Stacy gasped. ""*They* must have built it themselves!""

""But what does it do?"" Irwin pondered. ""I mean, obviously they're running themselves with this, but why this arrangement? It doesn't...oh, wait. Maybe it does.""

""What?"" Stacy watched Irwin walk over to her bench and look inside the red droid.

""I think I get it,"" he postulated. ""Step back and look at the arrangement as a whole, not as parts. What does it look like?""

""Kind of like..."" Stacy's brow furrowed. ""I don't know, a sponge?"" Suddenly her eyes lit up. ""It's a big shock absorber!""

""Exactly!"" Irwin trilled. ""We attach circuit boards with shock-absorbing mounts, but this takes it to another level!"" He pondered the intricate assembly for a moment. ""*Several* levels, actually. I've never seen *anything* like this.""

""Let's not sell it short,"" Stacy sniffed. ""We've never even *thought* of anything like this.""

Irwin continued to remove exterior panels on the blue bot. ""I think something like this would drive us mad before we got anywhere close to finishing. Plus, we'd need the design insights of a...a...""

""A supercomputer,"" Stacy finished. ""A really big one. Like what all the bots form at night, when they're left alone. Remember, we're only here eight hours a day; they spend a lot of time by themselves. Looking into everything they get up to when we're away would be its own full-time job. Well, several, at least.""

""Wow, would you look at this?"" Irwin had finished removing exterior panels, as the blue bot continued to lie there supinely. ""Even the exoskeleton is different!""

Stacy leaned in to look. ""The beams are thinner, more numerous, and...very finely machined."" She pushed on one gently with her finger. ""It's metal, but it almost feels rubbery. They've strengthened it with...geometry?"" She lowered a magnifier lamp over it, and dialed up the power. ""Look at the intricate patterns running along the length! I'm not even sure what they do!""

Irwin shrugged. ""Well, we can stop *this* part of the investigation. We've answered our original question; now we know how their fighting skills have improved so much recently. We can do the rest from our desks, querying the database about these new designs and how they work."" He turned to the blue bot. ""So are you willing to tell us all about it?"" The blue bot responded by rotating its primary sensor array towards Irwin and mimicking a salute. Irwin laughed. ""I'll take that as a yes!"" He turned to Stacy. ""Now the *real* discovery begins!""

Stacy sighed. ""Just as soon as we finish putting them back together.""

They heard a noise behind them. The red bot, carrying its outer circuit board, had crawled up to them. It proffered two of its front legs upwards. ""Do you want a boost, little guy?"" Stacy cooed. She lifted him up and put him on the workbench. It crawled closer to the blue bot and gently tapped Irwin's hand twice. ""Oh, you have this under control?"" Irwin laughed. The red bot immediately grabbed an exterior panel and began reconnecting it to the blue bot. Irwin and Stacy both stepped back.

Stacy looked puzzled. ""How are they operating with their outer circuit boards disconnected?""

Irwin's expression became thoughtful. ""That does mostly diagnostic operations. We need it to see how they're doing, but apparently *they* don't. I guess they have other methods!""

Stacy frowned. ""And somehow, this all escaped the notice of Big Daddy?""

Irwin shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't ask the right questions. But now *we* have a chance to!"" Irwin's eyes shone with wonder. ""This is bound to be a mind-blowing experience!""

Stacy looked beatific. ""Just one more thing I can't wait to learn about!""

Irwin smiled. ""Do you feel like a proud parent as much as I do?""

Stacy giggled. ""Yes! Our babies are growing up.""

Suddenly, Sam burst into the room. Stacy turned to him, smiling broadly. ""Wait until you hear what *we've* learned!""

""Never mind that!"" Sam shouted. Stacy and Irwin both froze. Sam tried to catch his breath. ""We have a *much* more pressing matter! I need you two at the cubicles, *now*!"" He ran off. Stacy and Irwin exchanged worried glances, then ran after him.

They arrived to find a video conference with Eric Thompson, already in progress. ""So you see what we're up against? We don't have any good options. Your work, in its present condition, is our only hope!""

Stacy tapped Dwight on the shoulder. ""What is he talking about?""

Dwight's eyes seemed to be filled with a sepulchral darkness. ""A jet airliner has been hijacked, and is headed our way. Eric wants us to try to stop it with a mecha.""

Stacy froze. ""Seriously?""

""All I want to know,"" Eric pleaded, ""is if there's a *chance*!""

""The rocket limbs have had a few controlled burns,"" Gary explained. ""They all worked as expected. But we haven't actually tried to fly it yet.""

Eric smiled. ""Well, today's the day! Are you up for it?""

""We've never even taken it *outside*!"" Isabel protested. ""In *theory*, it should work. All our tests have come back positive. But it's never been tried in the field!""

Eric wrung his hands. ""I'm sorry to ask this of you, but our backs are really up against the wall!"" He looked more unnerved than any of them had seen before. ""And I'm not going to sugarcoat this; you'll all be risking your lives. But a lot more lives hang in the balance, not to mention the success of our entire company! This is our make-or-break moment!"" He hung his head. ""I can't ask you to take this chance. You have to *choose* to.""

No one spoke. Then Dwight piped up. ""Some day I'll be an old man in a rocking chair on a porch, and I'll look back at this time...and if I don't act now, that old man is going to regret it and kick himself.""

""Yeah!"" Stacy exhorted. ""Let's *do* this!""

Sam could hardly contain himself. ""Then...I've always wanted to say this...*mecha pilots, assemble*!""

Gary, Dwight, Stacy, and Irwin, cheering loudly, ran for the hangar, the others close behind.

Eric turned his head; the camera followed to watch them leave. ""God speed, my brain-trust warriors.""

""How much fuel do we have on board?"" Gary asked breathlessly.

""Five hundred and twenty pounds,"" Dwight replied, gasping for air. ""We haven't refueled since our last burn.""

""No time now! What's our battery charge?""

""They should be full,"" Isabel answered. ""I left it plugged in.""

They arrived in the hangar. The four pilots ran off to their respective flight decks. The rest attended to the remote monitoring and diagnostic stations. ""Big Daddy!"" Sam shouted into the microphone. ""We're taking out the flying mecha. Are all systems go?""

""I heard about the hijacking, and the plan,"" Big Daddy answered in his usual sedate manner. ""All systems are go. My confidence is high. I just wish there was time to add fuel.""

Isabel threw a knife switch to raise the hangar door, as the various parts of the mecha powered on. ""Oh, heck,"" she said suddenly, as she ran towards the mecha, which was flexing its joints, doing its final tests. ""It's still plugged in!"" she yelled. ""I need a minute!""

Gary's voice squelched over the radio link. ""Uh...Sam? How do we get this thing outside? It's too tall for the hangar door.""

Sam stared blankly. ""Um...not sure. We've never tried it before.""

Isabel finished yanking out the assortment of extension cords, then high-tailed it back to her workstation.

Stacy's voice piped up. ""I think we have to crawl.""

The mecha lowered itself to the ground, and clumsily put its hands on the ground. After a few false starts, it began crawling towards the hangar door, its pace quickening as the crew got the hang of it. ""You know what they say,"" Dwight quipped. ""You have to crawl before you can fly.""

They reached the taxiway outside the hangar; unfamiliar sunlight poured into the mecha's sensors. Quickly, it adjusted to the new inputs, and gave its pilots a clear picture of their surroundings. Their mission computers all bleeped; the intercom link surged with Sam's voice. ""OK, I've linked you to the radar tracking of the bogey. We've got ten minutes until it reaches the outskirts of the city, and fifteen minutes until it reaches Unlimited Partners central HQ.""

Gary pondered the trajectory as Dwight fired the rocket limbs, preparing them for flight. ""We should be able to intercept it at the city's edge...but we're going to have to use our full thrust. This is going to be *really* rough. Are you all willing?""

All pilots answered affirmatively. ""Then off we go!"" Gary cheered as he slid all four thrust-power sliders to their maximum. The mecha shuddered uncertainly, slowly lifting off the ground, then wavered a little bit. As all four limbs pointed themselves down, in the same direction, suddenly it began picking up speed. It took off into the morning sky, piercing through the morning fog and vanishing.

""Aaaaah! I can't do this!"" Irwin yelled. ""I feel like I'm being crushed!""

""One moment!"" Gary yelled. ""OK, your suit should be extra pressurized now. Any better?""

""This really hurts!"" Irwin continued to scream.

""Keep screaming!"" Stacy yelled. ""It'll help keep you from blacking out!""

""She's right!"" Dwight interjected. ""Scream, tense up all your muscles, and hold in your stomach! We'll have to deal with maximum G forces until we get there!""

Irwin continued to scream; Gary turned down the volume on his intercom. ""As long as we can still hear him, it means he's OK. Some prior training for G forces would have been really helpful, but it's too late now.""

""Is this right?"" Stacy interrupted. ""Only seven minutes to intercept?""

""Sure looks like it,"" Gary agreed. ""The rocket-limbs are working really well. We're burning an awful lot of fuel, though. It'll take four hundred pounds just to reach the intercept point. I just hope Irwin can take it. Irwin, you hanging in there?""

""Aaaaaaaaaugh!"" Irwin continued to scream. ""I love iiiiiiiit! There's nothing else I'd rather doooooooo!""

Dwight was unconvinced. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""As long as he's still screaming, he's alive,"" Gary joked.

""He's fine,"" Isabel radioed. ""His vital signs are all good. Keep doing what you're doing, Irwin!""

""Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" he continued to yell.

""Can you imagine what they must be thinking on the ground?"" Stacy wondered.

""The anime fans are probably having a religious experience,"" Gary offered. ""Assuming they can see us.""

""That brings up an important issue,"" Dwight pointed out. ""What happens when the *hijackers* see us?""

""That depends,"" Gary offered. ""Are they going to be looking for a giant flying robot?""

""Uh...hmmm...good point. We'll have to hope we surprise them.""

The mecha continued to fly across the sky, angling upwards, its rocket-limbs spewing white-hot flames twice as long as its body. The mission computers had calculated that, given their current trajectory, that at the intercept point, they'd be five hundred feet above the airliner. ""I believe we can drop on them from above,"" Gary suggested. ""I think that's our best plan.""

""It's getting hot in here,"" Stacy observed. ""How's our cooling system?""

""Not yet running at full,"" Gary answered. ""I can turn them up. We should have sufficient battery power. Isabel?""

""You sure do,"" Isabel assured. ""You were charged to the top when you left.""

""I think I'm finally getting the hang of this,"" Irwin suddenly added, sounding strained.

""Glad to hear it, buddy!"" Gary chimed. ""I'm going to need your fine motor skills when we move to intercept. You ready for this?""

""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" Irwin gushed.

""Just keep up your G-force countermeasures,"" Isabel reminded. ""You're doing good, but don't relax them.""

""Not a problem,"" Irwin assured. ""They've become second nature.""

The rockets dropped their power slightly; the flight computers had adjusted the autopilot for the intercept. Gliding over the river that formed the northern border of the city, the mecha started to rotate in the air. Gary's voice filled the intercom. ""Hold on to your stomachs, people. This is going to feel really weird. Try not to get airsick.""

The mecha pivoted in the air, and pointed its limbs down, allowing it to hover. It came to a stop.

""The airliner is thirty seconds away, and we're seven hundred feet above it,"" Gary announced.

""And they don't *see* us?"" Stacy sounded incredulous. ""Not even on radar?""

""I'm not picking up any radar from them,"" Dwight observed. ""They must be operating on visual flight rules. Not a surprise if they're amateurs. They're probably just fixated on their target. Fortunately for us.""

The aircraft finally became visible on their external cameras. ""I'm ready for the intercept thrust,"" Gary announced. ""Irwin, you ready to grapple?""

""I was *born* to do this!"" Irwin exulted.

Gary counted down. ""Six...five...four...three...two...one...BURN!""

The mecha's limbs flung themselves back, and its rockets fired. The external cameras showed the plane approach; a few seconds before impact, its limbs swung down again, to slow its descent. With a loud, resounding crunch, the mecha impacted with the airliner. Quickly, its arms dove under the wings, and its hands met on the plane's roof, near the first-class section, putting the plane into a full nelson. Its feet pushed backwards, finding their grip on each side of the tail wing. A few tense moments passed.

""We're not stopping them!"" Gary shouted frantically. ""They've turned up their engines, and we don't have the fuel to use ours to slow them down!""

There was a few moments of silence. ""Can we kick our legs, like we're on a swing?"" Stacy suggested. ""If we can point the airliner upward, maybe we can get control of it.""

Gary sounded unsure. ""Irwin? Do the arms have a good grip?""

Irwin sounded confident. ""They're not going *anywhere*. Start kicking!""

The mecha's feet pulled themselves from the tail wings and began bucking wildly. Slowly, the airliner began to pitch upwards.

""I wonder what *this* looks like on the ground,"" Stacy asked sardonically.

Sam's voice, over the radio, feigned embarrassment. ""Um, well, when an airplane and a giant robot love each other *very* much...""

""It's working!"" Irwin suddenly exclaimed. ""Stop kicking! The airplane is in an aerodynamic stall. Its engines aren't enough to keep it in the air. Just a little bit of thrust from our legs, and we should be able to bring this unholy union to the ground!""

The mecha and airplane, locked in their hostile embrace, continued to plummet downwards.

""Why do you think the airliner hasn't cut its engines?"" Dwight asked. ""That would make our job a lot more difficult.""

""Maybe they didn't think of it,"" Gary suggested. ""We jolted them pretty hard when we hit; maybe they're unconscious.""

""Or maybe they're just panicking,"" Stacy wryly observed.

""Let's just hope our luck doesn't run out!"" Gary added. ""I think I can guide us to that empty field near the interstate. I'll try to slow down before we hit, but I can't guarantee anything. We're getting dangerously low on fuel. Brace for impact!""

On the ground, traffic on the interstate had come to a halt. People had left their cars to gawk at the garishly-colored spectacle plummeting towards them. As the airliner's jet engines continued to strain against its captor, the mecha fired its rockets in a finely-coordinated pattern, trying to steer them to the grassy plain, one of the few areas nearby that wasn't either trees or buildings. A few moments before reaching the ground, the mecha's leg-rockets suddenly flared brightly, slowing their descent and starting a few small brush fires. With a surprisingly gentle crushing noise, the airliner landed on the ground, the mecha still firmly attached to its top.

They continued to slide along the ground. ""Their engines are still firing! If we don't stop them, they'll drag us both into the river!""

""How about if I pinch their engines?"" Irwin offered. ""I'll have to let go with the arms, but I should be able to do this.""

""I think that's our best bet,"" Gary agreed. ""Do it!""

The mecha's arms let go. Quickly, it slid down the length of the airliner, but suddenly, the legs grappled the aircraft's sides, stopping its motion. Now in position, the arms reached towards the engines and crushed them with its hands. Jet fuel sprayed from the wounded turbines as the airliner and its giant passenger slid along the ground for several hundred more feet, finally coming to a stop.

The external microphones picked up a buzzing sound, growing louder. ""Where did the drones come from?"" Stacy asked. ""The highway?""

""That's it!"" Gary suddenly interjected. ""Irwin, rip the roof off of the flight deck! Let the drones take care of the hijackers!""

""You got it!"" The mecha shimmied up the length of the airliner; when it got near the front, its giant hands dug its fingers under the sides, peeling the roof back like a giant sardine can. Four hijackers stood in the exposed flight deck, gaping upwards in sheer terror. Quickly, the drones swarmed them; a few precisely-fired taser bolts later, and they all collapsed to the ground.

""YOU DID IT!"" a voice on the radio yelled. More cheering could be heard in the background. Stacy reacted with surprise. ""Wait, was that Eric Thompson?""

""It's me, and everyone else at headquarters!"" Eric answered. ""Plus several million more viewers on TV.""

""Wow,"" Stacy stammered. ""Way to bury the lede there, boss.""

""Are you kidding?"" Eric gushed. ""We wouldn't have missed this for the world!""

""Uh..."" Irwin began. ""Glad to be of service?""

The external microphones now picked up the cheers of the passengers. The emergency doors had opened, the exit chutes had inflated, and passengers were sliding out of the stricken aircraft as quickly as they could. Most of them gawked at the giant robot, which continued to sit astride the airplane, like a brightly-colored cowboy on a white horse. A few had run off, to stamp out the small brush fires caused by the mecha's rockets.

The external cameras showed the highway, the passengers having left their cars en masse. All were cheering and clapping.

""Did we actually live through that?"" Irwin's voice gasped weakly. ""The adrenaline is wearing off. I think I'm going to lose it.""

""Permission to lose it granted,"" Sam jokingly intoned. ""You've all done a great job.""

""You know what would be awesome?"" Dwight piped up. ""We should fly away from here, back to base, and salute in the air for everyone on the highway.""

""Not going to happen,"" Isabel related over the radio. ""You only have thirty pounds of fuel left.""

""Can we siphon anything from the airliner?"" Stacy asked.

Isabel paused for a moment. ""You don't have anything to siphon with,"" she sighed. ""We never thought to add such an attachment.""

""Then what do we do?"" Dwight pined. ""We can't just lay here and wait for a big flatbed to pick us up. That'd be embarrassing!""

""There's a truck stop about two miles down the highway,"" Sam offered. ""Diesel fuel is close enough to aircraft fuel for the mecha's systems. And between your remaining battery power, and the internal generators, you have enough power to..."" Sam paused for a moment. ""To walk there.""

""Well, I guess that'll still look pretty cool,"" Dwight agreed reluctantly. ""But not what I was hoping for.""

Gary's voice crackled over the mecha's loudspeakers. ""Citizens, please give me some space. I need to leave."" The passengers obediently formed a wide circle around the mecha. Slowly, it moved to stand up and dismount the airliner, to the cheers of everyone nearby. Unsteadily, the mecha walked towards the highway; the circle of people parted to let them through.

""Blast off! Blast off!"" the kids yelled, picked up by the external microphones. ""See, I knew they'd want that,"" Dwight sighed. ""We need to plan better in the future.""

Gary's voice once again blared from the loudspeaker. ""Sorry, kids. Not enough fuel. But maybe next time!"" All four pilots could hear their disappointed whines. Gary continued. ""Hey, c'mon, kids! I'm still a giant flying robot!"" The kids quickly began cheering again. The mecha slowly, clumsily walked away.

""OK, I think our autopilot can handle this,"" Gary declared. ""Just watch for sinkholes or loose soil.""

As they neared the highway, the disembarked passengers continued to cheer and clap. The mecha stopped and stood there. The loudspeaker crackled once again with Gary's voice. ""Citizens, please move your vehicles. I have to get home."" They finally stopped cheering, went back into their cars, and got out of the way. The mecha crawled up the embankment, walked across the lanes of traffic, and began trudging down the highway in the slow lane. Cars slowly drove past it, horns honking and passengers whooping, before driving off. The mecha occasionally saluted, to even louder cheers.

The customers at the truck stop could hear the rhythmic clanking noise from quite some distance away. As the mecha approached, most of them just stood and stared, their mouths gaping. The mecha walked into the parking lot, picked a row of interior pumps, and stood there, waiting. The loudspeaker flared again. ""Don't mind me, citizens. I just need fuel. I'll wait in line.""

The two truckers that were next in line made several animated arm gestures, then each got into their trucks, started them up, and moved to back up. The mecha backed up too, getting out of their way. Deftly, the trucks slithered past each side of the mecha, smoothly arriving back in their lanes. ""Thank you, citizens!"" the loudspeaker blared.

Slowly, the mecha lowered itself onto its hands and knees. From there, it shifted to a prone position, and began to army-crawl between the rows of gas pumps. The clanking and scraping made a ferocious noise that caused many onlookers to cover their ears. Finally, the mecha was in position, and the steady hum of its power shut down, leaving behind a ghostly silence.

A few moments passed. Then the sides of each limb opened up, and the pilots exited, lowering themselves gingerly to the ground. As the onlookers continued to gawk, the pilots nonchalantly pulled out their company credit cards, swiped them at the pumps, then each removed a gas cap and put the diesel spouts into the exposed fuel filler.

The trucker opposite Dwight stammered. ""Uh...er...um...what kind of mileage do you get in that thing?""

""I'm not sure,"" Dwight answered. ""We just burned about five hundred pounds; that got us a total of about fifteen miles. We used a lot less fuel during free-fall, though.""

""Free-fall?"" the trucker replied weakly. ""Buddy, you must have horseshoes in *both* pockets.""

A few families had crowded around Irwin. ""How do you become a giant-robot pilot?"" one kid asked.

""First, you have to invent it,"" Irwin answered. ""I'm part of the team that built this. We have two more back at our lab.""

""Do they fly too?"" The kid's eyes burned with adoration.

""Not yet, but after today, I'm sure we'll add it soon!"" The kid looked disappointed. Irwin continued. ""But...you know what they *can* do? Kung fu battle! Just like in the movies!"" The kid gaped wordlessly.

""What company do you work for?"" a man asked. ""Who is in the giant-robot business?""

""I'm with a research-and-development division of Unlimited Partners,"" Irwin answered. ""And we do a lot more than just giant robots.""

""Well, I'm sure glad you do!"" the man exulted. ""That was fine work, stopping that hijacking. Can you believe the government hasn't even released a statement on it? I think they're too humiliated.""

""I haven't had time to catch up on the news,"" Irwin explained. ""I'm sure I will...once I fly back to the office.""

""That's right, ladies — you *too* can become a giant-robot pilot!"" Stacy happily explained to a throng of Girl Scouts, hanging on her every word. ""And I don't just fly it; I helped *design* and *build* it! But you'll need to stay in school, study hard, and keep out of trouble! Jobs like these only go to the best! And *you* can make it this far, if you just apply yourselves!""

""We will!"" they cheered as they ran off to get back in their vans.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that,"" the den mother told Stacy.

""No problem, I get it,"" Stacy answered. ""I know the Girl Scouts are for at-risk children. Hopefully they stay inspired.""

The den mother glanced at the mecha, her eyes filled with wonder. ""If *that* doesn't inspire them...*nothing* will.""

A thin, gangly man in business-casual left the shop and approached Gary, a stunned look on his face. Gary turned and smiled. ""Are you the manager?"" He tried to answer, but couldn't find his voice; finally, he just nodded vigorously.

""What's the pre-authorization limit on these pumps?"" Gary asked nonchalantly.

""Uh...ummm...seventy five gallons,"" the manager stammered.

""Can we all get authorized for about a thousand gallons each? We have a long flight home.""

""I...um...yes. I'll...go do...that."" The manager walked off, looking behind him one last time before disappearing inside the shop.

As the mecha continued to fuel, Dwight walked up to Stacy. ""So...before the next time...*rubber shoes*.""

Stacy laughed. ""I know, right? I though the *flight* was bad...the walk was easily *twice* as bad! I think my bones are still shaking.""

""And rubber knee pads and elbow pads, too.""

""Yeah...I'm not looking forward to fixing all those scrapes. But can you imagine it? The mecha will look like a roller-derby player! How awesome would *that* be?"" Stacy looked at the mecha, grinning impishly. ""How about retractable inline skates? The *heck* with all this walking!""

""Oh yeah, huh?"" Dwight agreed. ""I guess there are some ideas that don't occur to you unless you try the thing in the real world."" Dwight looked at the mecha's back. ""And why the heck don't we have a giant flaming sword?""

The four pilots continued to field questions, and receive congratulations, as the pumps slowly filled up the mecha. Finally, they put the spouts back, replaced the gas caps, and climbed back inside their respective flight decks, giving the crowds one last thumb's up before disappearing inside, to the din of their hails and cheers.

The mecha powered up, its electric hum making the air shake. This brought on another round of applause and whooping. It slowly army-crawled from under the canopy, back to unobstructed space. The metallic screeching and scraping sound silenced the crowd quickly as they covered their ears and winced.

""*Oh* my God,"" Irwin began. ""I haven't dealt with so much of the public in my *life*!""

""I heard *that*!"" Stacy added. ""This was fun once, but if there are any more public appearances, I think we need to use gregarious pilot types. I thought the *battle* was tough...having to deal with people was *much* more draining!""

""Hey Gary, once we're out, can we launch with only three of the rockets?"" Dwight asked. ""I really want to try a salute as we leave.""

""I think that'll be safe,"" Gary answered. ""But don't try anything fancy. Just one salute and we're done.""

""Not a problem,"" Dwight laughed. ""I'm willing to start small.""

The mecha walked to the far end of the complex's parking lot, away from the people, trucks, and anything flammable. After turning to face the crowd, its leg rockets ignited, along with one arm. As the mecha launched into the sky, its free arm moved to salute, before dropping that arm down and firing the last rocket. The exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but the rockets made too much noise to hear them.

The flight back to their airport was uneventful and leisurely. There was no need to use full rocket power; all the pilots had had enough of high G forces for one day.

The mecha neared the airport. The exterior cameras showed that huge crowds had formed on either side of the runway. The radio suddenly crackled to life. ""Welcome back, robo-nauts!"" Eric Thompson's voice gushed. ""You're all heroes!""

""Oh, man,"" Gary answered. ""I hope you don't expect us to deal with any more people. All we want to do is collapse."" The mecha moved to land upright.

""Not a problem,"" Eric assured them. ""You just need to land and crawl back inside. We'll deal with the press.""

""Thanks, boss,"" Gary replied, with great relief in his voice. ""The truck stop was agonizing, but we didn't know what else to do."" The mecha landed gently on the ground; the exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but they couldn't be heard over the roar of the rockets.

""I understand completely,"" Eric commiserated. ""And rest assured, you all get the rest of the day off. Well, after a full medical exam. We want to make sure you're intact.""

The mecha got down on its hands and knees. ""So do we,"" Gary agreed. ""We're just glad to have survived.""

""So am I,"" Eric answered sanguinely. ""And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about the reaction. Lots of nonpublic stuff. You all did more good today than you can possibly imagine.""

The mecha crawled through the hangar door. ""That's fine...but *tomorrow*. We need a break.""

""You've earned it,"" Eric agreed. ""Have a good evening.""

The hangar door closed behind the mecha, the loud clang reverberating across the runway."
"Musicianship in a cyberpunk worldI know in reality we listen to certain electronic music and call it ""cyberpunk music"" because it evokes the themes or atmosphere of a work of cyberpunk fiction... But I'm curious about what you could call the inversion of that.

My question: in a cyberpunk world, what is it like to be a musician?  Obviously, the answer can vary depending on the particulars of the setting. 

Here's a list of elements I'd expect from cyberpunk musicianship:

* Matrix jam sessions. Jack in and have a jam session with your buds. Play whatever instrument you can think of/code up.  Save samples from the jam and mix them into new songs in minutes.

* A vast majority of meatspace instruments would be electronic and mid-tier and above might have a mini-deck in them to interface with the grid, for holo broadcasting live music.

* Mass-produced instruments would be easy to play, but would be very limited. Like a midi keyboard that can only play notes in one key, and automatically do only chords in that key. In these cases, musicianship is dumbed down so that anyone can play some notes that sound okay together.

* Cyberpunks might build their own instruments that would also be electronic but, like MIDI instruments today, are capable of playing many different notes. Would be similar in function to the mass produced shit but the notes would be digitally-synthesized by the creator of the instrument. The sound would be highly distinct from mass-produced instruments but would not allow for very much expressiveness from the player.  These would be the low-medium tier instruments.

* Expert cyberluthiers might integrate high-density touchscreens into the instrument that allows for higher-definition input. This would approximate an analog electronic instrument like an electric guitar.

* ""Old-fashioned"" electronic instruments would be easy to make, but would require also using an Analog-digital-converter before being usable in pretty much any modern application. So, they exist but are pretty much just a hobby project for interested musicians.

* The only acoustic/brass/woodwind instruments anyone sees anymore on a regular basis belong to CEOs, who have carefully manufactured androids to play them.  Naturally, these androids sound technically skilled and precise but are missing the subtle, indescribable expressiveness of a real human virtuoso. If memory serves, this sort of lacking was described in Big O about a robot pianist.

Of course these are just my expectations. What are yours?"
"Cyberpunk Settings/Premises You're Too Lazy To Actually Write About?Has anyone else thought up a pretty Cyberpunk-ish world and never actually written anything about it? This could extend to any other format it could be expressed in like film, video games, or anything else that you simply don't have the skill or time to actually create. I'm a shitty writer and terrible at exposition so I can rarely form anything coherent, but I enjoy idly thinking about various fictional premises. I'll self plug mine:

>Early 2050's Los Angeles. Technology has not increased exponentially, but things like conventional robotics and cybernetics have just started to become practical, and digital media has only become more involved in every facet of everyday life. Across America and Europe, an unknown group (In actuality, a group of nine dozen agents raised almost from birth to operate under the command of an ex-CIA agent, using resources from a vast disconnected network of government shadow entities.) continues to commit extremely well planned and equipped attacks, mainly assassinations of prominent members of western governments and corporations, as well as the sabotage and destruction of related material entities. To date, several have defected and gone into hiding or been killed, but none have been traced to a life outside the group. The group is widely publicized as anti-internationalist, anti-tech terrorists. They exist alongside many other violent political anti-government groups that regularly enact violence that would be unheard of several decades before, although none rival the organization and effectiveness of this unknown group. In government reports, they are most often referred to as The 108.

> In Los Angeles, like many cities across the US and the world, advances in technology and industry has led to rapid expansion of urban areas, and the increasing devotion of public police forces to the entities of government subsidized corporations has lead to a resurgence in criminal enterprise and general gang activity. In the late 2020s, the Japanese government's rapid transition into an isolationist, militaristic regime forced many Japanese that were considered dissidents, including the Yakuza and various criminal entities, to flee east, Los Angeles being one of the primary stopping points. Yakuza cliques, such as the Imperial Club and Cicada Club, quickly found a home in the rising criminal scene among the older black and Hispanic gangs, adopting a more business style approach to crime and rubbing shoulders with various corporations. Immigrant youth formed *bosozoku* style biker gangs, adopting a distinct style of violence that distinguished them from their more refined countrymen.

> In the early 2040s, after a coup de tat by ultranationalist components of the Russian military escalated into open conflict, a number of tactical nukes were detonated in cities across Russia. The standing government collapsed and millions of Russians fled to  Eastern Europe and to western American cities like Los Angeles, like the Japanese little more than a decade before. In 2050, Russian immigrant gangs, who were widely considered to be low level slum thugs on the level of the Hispanic and black gangs that they engaged in relatively restricted conflict, launched a massive gang war against every other criminal faction in LA.

> Using surplus Russian weaponry, including advanced cybernetics decades ahead of commercial civilian products, smuggled in after the collapse of the government, the Russians, now dubbing themselves the ""Rodinokhrana"" or ""The Rok"", transformed overnight from drug slinging slum rats to a paramilitary. In the proceeding weeks, they left literal thousands of bodies on the streets, including those of the Yakuza cliques. Going door to door throughout apartment blocks and slums, squads of masked and heavily armed militias simply killed anyone with the vaguest association to non-Russian criminal entities. The operation was orchestrated by a shrouded group of ex-military operatives, including a 108 child who defected in his teens, and whose mental conditioning, itself rooted in Soviet developed psychological techniques, was taken advantage of.

> A little more than two years later, a retired CIA operative, 51 year old Bram Rowtischki, who had served under the man that secretly founded the 108 group thirty years before receives a package with a coded message bearing two words: FIND 91, as well as the code to an attached briefing. Knowing only a few other men could decipher the language of the code, he is well aware of what will happen should he refuse. Arriving in LA, he quickly finds himself allying with the remnants of the older criminal factions as the Rok catches wind of his snooping and sics every cybernetically modified militia enforcer at their disposal on him. With the clandestine aid of the 108, Bram delves into the middle of the power games between rogue forces, megacorporations, and the government he once worked for.



So basically the 108 (Significant number in a lot of dharmic religions) is a Unabomber style anti-technology and general anti-government group that seeks to impede the advancement and implementation of increasingly advanced technology because it will be used by governments to control people. The founder/leader, David Kor, was a CIA (In this setting, the CIA never stopped doing the shady clandestine power game shit they did in the 60s, they just got better at hiding it, and became an entity essentially independent of the main U.S. government) operative involved in the dirtiest of dirty government work for the latter quarter of the 20th century and into the 21st. 

He realized that the only thing stopping the U.S. and pretty much every other world power from exerting total control over 99% of the populace is the lack of technology to do so. He became obsessed with reports his mentor had made concerning a Soviet mental conditioning program. In the 2010s, he went rogue and set the stage for his plan, finally selecting and obtaining 108 biologically suitable children in 2029, all a year old at the most. Using information from the Soviet program and his own experience in the CIA, he ensured that each child developed into the ultimate operative, skilled in infiltration tactics as well as combat and social manipulation. 

Nearly every child tried to run away at least once during field training, but the psychological manipulation and almost subconscious sense of camaraderie that was ingrained into them since infancy insured they would either return of their own volition or be brought back by one of the other children. By the 2040s, each of them had the skills of a veteran operative in their late teens, and they were shortly thereafter let loose under Kor's calculating leadership to destabilize what Kor wanted to destroy. Kor, now in his nineties and kept alive and lucid by medicine and cybernetics only his kind of connections could obtain, is wrapping up the loose ends from the few outside the 108 that have knowledge which could compromise his operations, including the half dozen or so defectors of the original 108, calling upon old contacts like Braum. He also plans to rear a new generation of thousands of operatives, preparing some of his operatives to replicate the program which created them. 

Sorry for the walls of text but like I said, incoherent and shit at exposition lol. I can write paragraph upon paragraph of blatant description but any narrative I try to make falls apart. Anyone else got some interesting settings or advice for this one?"
"Cyberpunk office suggestionsHey gang! I'm a cosplayer and I want my closet office to be cyberpunk inspired. All that is inside right now is a foldable table, a computer, and a large 3d printer. I would love to use my cosplay/maker skills to spice things up a bit (perhaps some fake robotics?), I'm open to any ideas and suggestions, and dont be afraid to give crazy ideas, if I put my mind to it I can create just about anything."
"I haven't done this in a while (never on this sub), and I need some inspiration ...I've been running out of ideas for art recently, but I've mostly been sticking to cyberpunk stuff, so I figured it would fit here. What do you think I should put in my next drawing? (Half of the exercise is so I can have odd things to draw and improve my skills, and the other half is so I can extrapolate and pile up details into a whole drawing.)

Things happening, cybernetics or accessories, signs, anything would be greatly appreciated!"
"Would you categorize Borderlands as Cyberpunk?Just a little thought I was having while playing. There's no rainy neon cities or anything like that, but the story is about a giant megacorps racing each other colonizing a random dirt planet in search of a profit margin left by aliens and certain individuals with special abilities trying to compete with them. Many characters have robotic arms or legs, and some of the skills the vault hunters have include summoning a killer robot out of thin air and a cybernetic ninja crating holograms of himself.

What you y'all think?"
"Cyberpunk Premises?What are some cyberpunk premises for literature, games, films, etc. you've thought up? Here's one I made up when I was like 13 or something after playing Dead Space and I've been fucking around with the idea since, not that I have the skill to actually produce any interesting media about.

> So get this, the Burj Khalifa, times twenty, on Phobos, the larger moon of Mars. It's the early 23rd century, and 75-85% of the Earth's population migrated to Mars on colony ships because of global warming/nukes/climate change or something. Factions based mostly on language are formed between the human colonies, with massive cities being constructed from sections of the colony ships and automatic construction. Terraformers are increasing the oxygen content of the planet, and water is extracted from the poles. Anyways none of that matters because I can't even start to think about the fucked up geopolitics on a planet with no oceans or atmosphere. 
 
 > So anyways, super space Burj Khalifa 2.0, named Al-lat, was built by the UAE/some rich Arab superstate as a high end resort/residence for the wealthy from all around the world, using particle acceleration engines that reduce trips to Martian space to a month or two versus half a decade. With millions of kilos of luxury supplies stored outside of the main structure, as well as hydroponic farms, a satellite network, and multiple nuclear reactors, Al-lat is entirely self-sufficient, capable of housing around 400,000 people. By the time of this exodus, the project has been in a funding crisis for years and the few people that remain are a couple of the construction company officials, wealthy investors fleeing political turmoil, around 60,000 workers, and several thousand security personnel. The rich/security officials live on the lower, more finished portion of Al-lat, and most of the workers live in the higher, incomplete portions, in a proto-slum called ""The Penthouse"", constantly threatened by the low structural integrity of the neglected architecture. I imagine this as a bunch of people living in scrap shantytowns ironically built on top of unfinished resort structures such as malls, hotels, amusement parks, etc.
> Although they are aware of whatever crisis caused the migration, it will be years before any of the supermassive colony ships(too large for particle accelerator engines because they explode when they're big or use too much energy or something idk how I'm gonna handwave that one) reach Mars, and the few refugees arriving in hijacked industrial ships are shot down by the planetary (moon-etary?) defenses. A separatist faction of the Slavic Union's (Basically USSR 2.0 but space fascism) Navy runs off with a good deal of their spaceships and a bunch of nukes while the main government decides to stay on what is left of Earth. They lay waste to Al-lat's defenses, and curbstomp the security before occupying the station and continuing construction to accommodate  the 100k or so people they brought with them, as well as building a nuclear defense system on Deimos, the smaller Martian moon. The larger population only further increases the strain on the systems that allow Al-lat to be self sufficient and a divide is very quickly formed between the laboring slumgoers and the Military/Security government.
 > 30 or so years later, Martian colonies have already become semi-developed and there exists a black market smuggling trade between them and the denizens of Al-lat. Sometime, somehow, a biological agent developed by an ancient Martian civilization finds it's way into Al-lat. Originally created as a performance enhancing combat stimulant for a Martian species, this agent is a rapidly reproducing bioorganism that has very different effects on humans. The organism latches into the nervous system before spreading across the veins and arteries, manifesting as a fungus like covering over the skin, then clustering and ultimately immobilizing the host (Think TLOU cordyceps)). Those exposed to it quickly become irrationally aggressive, and they will not cease attacking any other living thing, including other hosts, until their muscles are totally destroyed or their nervous system is. The catch is, if you have been exposed to any amount of genetic material from this Martian species (which is possible enough if you've been in contact with the fossilized remains of one or one of their biomechanical artifacts), then the agent works as originally intended and you basically have superpowers. As expected, shit hits the fan when this spreads into the Penthouse, and the security forces, formed from the Separatists, come in and try to slaughter everything with a pulse.

"A little cyberpunk short story I wrote this morningTales from Building 81

Room 84

Gauge stormed towards the door of Lash's apartment, pushing forward at an unchanging pace despite the hallway before him appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The severely damaged lights above him, flickering. Though they always bugged him, they weren't the cause of his foul mood this time, just icing on the shitcake. Plastic clacked as he fumbled with his keys, too angry to differentiate the one Lash had lent him, until the door swung open with a beep.

A smile to compliment the nice gesture adorned the face of Gauge's friend Tejas, which quickly faded as the latter realized that a key mishap was insufficient to explain the intensity of the dark cloud over Gauge's psyche.

""What's up, man?""

Gauge was hesitant to answer the question, because it would mean admitting that he had allowed one of Tejas' kindest gestures towards him to go to waste. You see, Tejas had ""fixed"" Gauge's rickshaw, which had been chained to the railing at top of the stairs (it was a floor inhabited only by Gauge (illegal subletter) and his friends (slightly more legal subletters)) which reached their terminus around a corner, invisible to those even just one below on the seventh. It was a perfectly good hiding place, and an even better digital bike lock. Two-factor security...all for nothing.

Someone had found his rickshaw, and hacked the lock. ""Hacked"" as in taken off with a hacksaw. All three of the wheels that the artificial spidersilk sentinel had snaked through--stolen, and now Gauge had no night job. He figured he would at least tell Tejas that much.

""I, uh, I might have lost my job.""

""Aw, man! I hope it wasn't my fault,"" Tejas looked up at him, not knowing how to feel.

""No, dude, not at all. You're the only reason I kept that job as long as I did,"" Gauge gushed, guilty at both his inability to tell the truth and for having made his friend anxious. ""And I don't know for sure that I've lost it, actually. Not yet.""

The fact was, Tejas *was* the reason Gauge still(?) had a real job. He had hacked the dastardly tracking device that central management had imposed on his rickshaw in a most easily replicable fashion, detailed below for the non-technical.

First, backstory: Gauge's job as the skipper, main engine, maintenance man, and, up until now, guardian of his rickshaw was predicated upon compliance with an odious auto-sophisticating surveillance apparatus, each update reaching deeper into his dome. He was trapped on a vicious treadmill of having to invent new ways of covering up his stops for bathroom breaks, bubble tea purchases (cheap enough to justify as a work expense, at least in his part of Chinatown), and other basic human needs that needed to remain hidden in order for him to keep his job of cosplaying as a robot. If he failed, the other pedal-pushers, who were all surely doing it, too, would out-compete him, his numbers would fall to the bottom relative to theirs, and the increasingly-efficient System would eject him automatically, no possibility of appeal, no two-weeks notice (completely legal).

As the invisible hand became unbearably more difficult to fool, Tejas offered poor Gauge a solution: He build his friend an invisibility cloak of an exceedingly simple design.

To understand the effectiveness of this basic two-part device, it is important to first understand the course of a normal (haha) night at work for Gauge. In the afternoon, he would pedal to a hot zone meeting point, hand-picked each day by the surveillance technology that terrorized him. At the meeting point, he would be greeted by his competitors, who would form a circle one-by-one around the team leader, who was always the first one there, thanks to his Tesla electric scooter.

Gauge didn't know his team leader's name, nor did he want to. The jerk must have mentioned it at some point, but Gauge, in his internal monologue, just called him Bert. The guy was a dead ringer for the conehead from the cancelled PBS show (lack of funding), with coiffed hair, thick, plastic Harry Potter glasses, and a scarf to boot. He sipped smugly on a latté (where the Hell did he get a latté in Chinatown? Gauge wasn't aware of any such place) rather than making small talk, thank God.

When the last member of the ""team"" finally pedaled, heaving, into the last open spot in the circle (which would surely belong to someone else tomorrow), the meeting began. Bert waved an iPad over the traitorous tracking device on each rickshaw, read off useless information to everyone about how they fucked up yesterday by drinking too much water and going to the bathroom too much, and what they could do differently today get their numbers up. Then he sent them off.

That was it. Gauge couldn't believe it was a job, much less a job that paid for lattés.

But Tejas, loyal, kind, ingenious Tejas, had outsmarted Bert and even the black box. The secret to his device was this: The tracker turned off automatically while charging, and therewhen would not log errors such as water breaks. Taking advantage of this, Tejas hid a battery pack inside the rickshaw with USB charging cable around it coiled, which Gauge could unwind and plug in when necessary. It was simply brilliant!

Under this new arrangement, Gauge would pedal as far from the prying eyes of Bert as possible--something he would have done anyway--and, after logging a safe number of errors for realism's sake, he would plug the tracker in. Gauge made with his tormenter a deal: The box would get juiced up while taking a nice nap, Gauge would relax and lower his risk of constipation by dehydration, and both would still keep their jobs by making more than enough money (which had never been a problem for Gauge, optimization be damned).

But now it had all been for nothing. Gauge, with Tejas still looking at him, struggled to come up with a way to avoid telling him the crushing news of the stolen wheels.

Salvation came in the form of a familiar face and an unfamiliar smell. Benji, the resident chemist, appeared in the doorway to his room, huffing another one of his concoctions. He wore safety goggles, an advanced breathing mask with yellow LEDs indicating it would soon be time to change the filters, and always, *always* a cloud.

In fact, neither Gauge nor Tejas nor even Lash, the only one of them who was supposed to be living there, had ever seen him unaccompanied by a cloud. Or perhaps it was the cloud that was accompanied by him. It was the same story every day...he would open the door to his room (he had his own room because no one would share with him, lucky Benji) and noxious fumes from the latest experiment would billow out, with Benji always emerging eventually (sometimes the other three worried). Genie that he was, it was almost as if the cloud created him, and not the other way around.

It gave Gauge an idea.

""I'm gonna go to the Encampment,"" he diverted, turning to Tejas. ""I need to take my mind off of all this.""

""Keep an eye out, man,"" Tejas implored, still helpful despite everything. ""The guy who stole it might be there.""

He had a point. The Encampment was a model for a new society, free from the mass surveillance, and money-grubbing that ruled the world the rest of us live in. It was also free from things like hygiene, and rule of law. It was entirely possible that Gauge's thief was there, trying to trade the wheels out for drugs.

If Gauge caught the fucker there, he could easily take the wheels back and beat the creep up. He would definitely be banned from the Encampment for life, if anyone sober enough to report his lack of solidarity happened to see it. Not that being banned would matter. Gauge only ever went there for one thing, and though he'd never admit it, it was not something he needed more of.

Halfway down the hall to the elevator that only occasionally came, Gauge saw the most beautiful sight he'd ever seen. Luckily for him, it wasn't the first time, and, if he could find a way to cope with the loss of his livelihood without frying his brain tonight, it wouldn't be the last.

""Joce!"" he squeaked, using his pet name for the love of his life, Jocelyn.

""Hey!"" she returned, equally glad to see him.

(they're not a thing yet, though. Don't rush them)

They ran up to each other, not yet ready to greet with hugs, both swaying warmly with as-of-yet unrequited feelings.

Gauge forgot his troubles, an effect he could have capitalized on instead of going to the camp.

Joce asked him, with characteristic playfulness, ""Where ya headed?""

""Oh, I'm going to the camp,"" replied Gauge, as nonchalant as possible.

Joce scowled. ""Nothing good ever goes on there. Why don't you stay here, where it's less dangerous?""

Gauge looked around the hallway, wondering whether it had ever killed a resident prone to epileptic seizures.

""No, I...I think I'll head out. It's not even dark yet, and I need the fresh air.""

Joce did not like the sound of this. She knew that what really drew him to the Encampment was the exact opposite of ""fresh air"".

""Gauge,"" sternly, ""no ampoules.""

""Of course not,"" he lied, brushing past.

While Gauge takes a rickety ride on an elevator that may very well mercy-kill him before he does the unthinkable, allow me to explain: Ampoules, or ""amps"" as for which Gauge will ask around at the camp, are the latest plague to have been unleashed on Chinatown--an unconscionable invention whose progenitor should have shot himself, I don't care if the man would have gone on to cure cancer. Amps are highly addictive (though Gauge didn't have an addictive personality, so he was only subject to the other deadly effects), directly attack the IQ, and are cut with various cheap poisons that intensify the high, to the benefit of the dealer's profits, and the detriment of our now-even-more-quickly-dying society.

Let's just blow through the part when Gauge plows past the diseased throng of junkies, proselytizers, and US intelligence agents in disguise, because we're just as disgusted by them as as he is.

Eventually, he found a dealer.

Gauge and the dealer went for a walk away from the tents, huddling together so they wouldn't be overheard as they shuffled their way down the alley, just in case.

""So,"" Gauge starts, trying to make small talk, ""How goes the society of the future?""

""What future?"" the dealer coughed. ""It's the same old shit.""

Oh, thought Gauge. He doesn't want to talk.

Gauge should have been so lucky. The dealer launched into a rant.

""These stupid fuckin' kids, thinkin' they're starting something new. How's this gonna be the society of the future, when they can't even break away from the old System? I can't even do my job there--I'm trying to provide an important service! And I can't even set my table up, there. You know why? It's not because of the narcs...damn place is crawling with narcs, but it's not because of the narcs, oh no. It's those damn kids, tweetin' everything they see! They're addicted to their phones. Addicted!"" he scoffed, setting his addictive chemicals out on a pop-up table.

Unfortunately for all of us, he continued: ""Society of the future...bah! There ain't gonna be no future. With those kids tweetin' everything that goes on down here, the feds have more than enough crap on us. It's only a matter of time before they move in and shut the whole thing down.""

It was at that very moment, as the poison salesman placed the last amp down on the table, that a gunshot rang out from the camp. Shouting ensued, loud enough that, even at the end of the alley, Gauge could barely hear the dealer.

""Show's over!""

Like a spider going to work on her prey, the dealer's arms précised the display back into the briefcase with dexterity matched only by their speed. A quantum blur of arm over arm recovered amps, table, and all, disappearing before Gauge could surreptitiously grab one.

""Damn!"" he breathed as the dealer blew past, disappearing along with Gauge's hopes of drowning his sorrows.

As the tents fell and the future burned, on the ground shimmered a glint of hope. Gauge bent down.

With an ominous grin, he stood back up holding a forgotten relic. Despite his surgical precision, the dealer had missed one single amp.

The fluid was brown rather than the usual gold, but Gauge's better judgement had been weakened by the day's craziness. As the sun set and the bright future so many had hoped for was trampled, Gauge released the dark mixture into his body.

Immediately, he regretted it, convulsing as the damage spread to innards that had never before felt the touch of these newly-invented chemicals. He shook as the tingling turned to pain, and joined in the screaming that filled the city.

Bursting through the door of Lash's apartment, Gauge's screaming continued, having never stopped. He would never have been able to unlock the door in his current state, thank God it was still unlocked from earlier.

The other three came rushing from their rooms/closets.

""What's wrong?""

Before Gauge could answer, a knock on the door shook the entire apartment building.

One, two, three.

Cops.

Gauge froze for the first time since his stupid sin, still only for a split second. As he went back to shaking, Lash stepped up to the plate.

Lash opened the door, slipped outside before any of Benji's strange smells could, and shut the door behind him without any indication he was hiding something. Smooth.

""Can I help you, officers?"" he asked with a perfectly-calibrated combo of respectful-yet-not-meek, balanced by confident-yet-not-presumptuous.

The two cops stood there, staring at him coldly, bodycams ruthlessly interpreting Lash's biometric data to the cops' HUDs to see if they could pin on him some offense against public justice. Hesitation could be interpreted as resisting. A cross look could be assault. Failure to make eye contact--lying to the police.

The younger one spoke first, ""Are you Gabriel Peters?""

Lash kept his cool, answering, ""No, sir. I'm Merva Lash, the sole renter of this property.""

Lash was proud to be the only one of the group who had enough of his life together to land a lease, and wanted everyone to know it. Even these two cops who were about to arrest them all.

Inside, Tejas and even Benji watched in horror as Gauge flopped about on the couch like a dying fish.

The rookie cop continued, ""This is the residence of Gabriel Peters, correct?""

Lash would not betray his friend and subletter, and Gauge knew this. Gathering his composure, he stuffed his hands into his pockets, lest his shakes be mistaken by the cops for fear (not that he wasn't rightly terrified).

Before Lash could come up with a lie that, despite his cool, would have instantly doomed them all, Gauge appeared next to him.

""I'm Gabriel Peters,"" he fessed up, sheepishly.

The cops eyed him. Though their visors were mostly transparent, their expressions were unreadable.

""Were you at 34 West Lincoln Street earlier today?""

He knew they meant the Encampment. He also knew that he couldn't lie. It would almost certainly be detected by the inscrutable eye of the technological System Tejas had helped him narrowly avoid earlier that week, but this time, it had the power of arrest.

""Yes.""

The cops' eyes widened.

""And you live here?""

They stepped toward Gauge, but Gauge knew they were really moving for the door. Once they open it, he thought, it's all over.

Gauge took his one final chance to save his friends, knowing he'd be dead before he arrived at the jail anyway.

""No, officer. I was planning to stay here tonight, but I've been living at the Encampment.""

The cops' eyes widened even more, before they set themselves straight and clenched their jaws. The rookie slammed his hand down on Gauge's shoulder.

""You'd better come with us.""

As he was ushered down the hall, Gauge felt the cold chill of regret.

""Wait, I heard the gunshot, but it wasn't me!""

The cops ignored him. His friends stuck their heads out of the door, watching  in horror as he was carted away. Gauge looked back and forth between them and the cops. There was no good answer. He had to use all of whatever brainpower had survived the dreadful amp attack.

""Wait!"" he yelled, pulling away from the cops. He ripped his hands out of his pockets. They shook so violently that the cops began to reach for their weapons, but stopped when they realized what a mess the wreck shivering before them was.

""I've never seen anyone shake like that, not even a tweaker,"" blurted out the rookie.

The older cop focused his eyes on the inside of his visor, then back at his trainee, replying, ""HUD says it's real.""

They both paused for a moment, pondering the miserable creature.

""Do you really think I could even...hold a gun like this?""

The cops looked back and forth between him and the neverending stream information on their HUDs.

At last, wordlessly and with a shared look of distain, they left for the elevator.

Gauge barely made it back inside. Out of the frying pan, into the fire of Hell that coursed through his very veins.

Lash and Tejas watched their redeemer twisting there on the floor, helplessly.

Benji, much to everyone's surprise, knelt down next to the victim. Benji wasn't known to be an altruist, yet he produced a mysterious jar, clearly intended as some remedy to ease Gauge's suffering.

It was several seconds before Gauge even noticed.

""Drink this,"" commanded Benji.

Gauge was dumbfounded.

""Your insides are dissolving. You have a chemical problem, and I am a chemist. So listen to me. Drink it.""

Every faculty of reason that had survived the scourge of the amp told Gauge to resist, yet what was he resisting for? His life was about to be over. What more did he have to lose?

""Drink it.""

No, there had to be some other way. The elevator was always late. The cops would still be standing there waiting for it. They could speed him to the hospital. But why? Gauge had fought so hard to get away from them. Now the only thing standing in the way of Benji's offer was pride.

""Why should I?"" Gauge gasped at him, as defiantly as he could muster.

""Because,"" Benji, who almost never said anything to anyone, rasped, ""It will clear everything out of your system. Everything.""

Gauge tried to look at him skeptically, but all he could manage was a look of pain.

""It's for my cleansing ritual,"" Benji creepily continued, ""And it's the last of my supply. So please, take it, before the damage is permanent. Otherwise, it will be a waste.""

This unexpected ray of kindness, from so unlikely a source, finally broke through to Gauge. He gave in.

""Well,"" nodded Benji as Gauge choked down the last few sips of the brackish piss, ""That ought to do it.""

And, miraculously, it did. Gauge sat there on the floor, soaked in sweat and whatever else, but still, and alive.

Benji chuckled with a perfect brew of self-satisfaction, an amount just small enough to keep Gauge from strangling him, ""It's the least I can do after selling your wheels to make rent this month."""

What you y'all think?"
"So I have a story concept: cyberpunk/sovietpunk + '70s stoner rock + A Clockwork OrangeJust today, I've come up with a dystopian story concept. Anyone who knows me knows I'm working on a semi-utopian work of science/speculative fiction (though I haven't updated it recently, it has a subreddit, /r/MotherMeki). In the past few weeks, I've decided to clean it and [another story](/r/AstralFalls) up, removing a lot of bloat that wasn't gelling with what the stories had become and what my plan for them involved.

One story that spun off from these works is a story I have decided to call ""***Black Saturday***"". It's still in its infancy, though it benefits from having several concepts already worked out. In fact, a lot of this is being put down in words for the first time as I write this, and I'll almost certainly write up the story itself later on tonight or tomorrow.

#*So here's the gist*

The setting is England in an alternate timeline. World War II lasted twelve years, from 1939 to 1951, and this is due to Hitler being assassinated in 1941 and replaced with a much more competent leader (as of yet unnamed). Britain was invaded, occupied for half a decade, and then subsequently bombed back into the stone age during the American invasion. Japan stayed out of America's business until 1943, thus taking more of China and Manchuria and thus being more capable of fighting a prolonged war. Nuclear bombs fell on America, Japan, Germany, Russia, and Britain, and several hundred million were killed. Japan managed to maintain their empire in the East so they reached a stalemate with the US and Soviets. 

The resulting world became a softcore *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, until roughly the '80s. Then America balkanized and it was all down to the Soviets and Japanese.

With the US's fall, any aid Britain was receiving stopped coming, and society all but collapsed. Japan and the USSR rush to take the West. In Britain, the Soviets grabbed the government, but the Japanese established corporate power, and these two sides war against each other.

The story revolves around three British youths, collectively known as the ""*Blood Wizards of Walpurgis*"". 

- Sturgis Kingsley. A Cockney kid from a broken home, who's easily the most morally reprehensible of them all, having done his bits with the old ""in-out-in-out"" multiple times. To rub it in, he carries a phallic wobbly bat around.

- Donny Lordhouse. He's actually a cyborg, and he's the most laid back of the group. He's probably the only one with actual motive, as he was born without arms, and his prosthetic arms were ripped off by a sore-loser rich brat after he beat him at a game. Donny couldn't do anything since said brat was the son of a commissary. 

- Oswald Gallagher. Oswald is the true cyberpunk, and he's gotten his mates to join him in online trolling. This one is malicious; Ozzy once deleted a working man's entire stash of bitcoins— his life savings— for the lulz. 

Three schoolboys of the Dunhurst Studentry. Moptopped rocker-haired misfits with stupendous sideburns who have taken to drugs and ultraviolence. They were raised in a Soviet schooling system (a Studentry), yet have turned their backs on order. Their daily lives involve getting stoned, harassing people, breaking robots, and getting involved in gang fights. 

The whole region is locked down in something very strongly resembling the Irish Troubles, complete with street violence, bombings, and gun battles.

The government has become increasingly totalitarian, while the corporations are doing their best to cement their own power. All this is doing is worsening gang violence. 

The Blood Wizards of Walpurgis are so named because they beat a man to death and used his blood to tag the words 'Wizard Bloody Wizard' onto a wall. They're also suspected of occultism, particularly cyber occultism— a new variant caused by nanotechnology. Of which, they are guilty. In fact, their whole borough is known as 'Walpurgis' because of all the cyber occult and cyber Satanic active; electric wizards using nanotech to download demons from the internet. 


The story itself has two perspectives. One is third person limited, following each Blood Wizard's side story. The other is first person collective perspective; that is, all three Blood Wizards as one. This is how the main story is told. As of right now, the main story is very simple: it's the Blood Wizards pissing off powerful people and dealing with the consequences through raw, bloody violence until they wind up getting drawn away from each other; Kingsley becoming a fascist, Lordhouse becoming a part of the corporations, and Ozzy becoming an anarchist.

They are unapologetic punks in full. They are nadsat brats from the future. The architecture is more inspired by 1970's Britain than traditional cyberpunk. In fact, as I look into the story more and more, I'm starting to realize that this is basically a '70s reimagining of cyberpunk. There's a lot more electronic riff rock and post-hippie nonsense, a lot more psychedelia and navel gazing. Basically what Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" looks like if it were rewritten by William Gibson and sung by 1971-era Black Sabbath. 

I'd argue that it's more cyber-nadsat than cyberpunk. I don't know what I'm saying either because I'm responding to it just as much as you are, but that's the vibe I'm getting. I need to see where this goes."
"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

Very Helpful Robots
Scientists covered a robot finger in living human skin
"we already live in a cyberpunkIf  you think about it we truly do,  we have technology that only a couple of decades people could only dream of,  technology that for them it would be like something that they only could see in films.

  Our society is already been deteriorating for years and it's only getting worse, are world is becoming more extreme and dependant heavily in technology,  corporations are gaining more power,  the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer.

The only things that we are missing is more neon lights,  a culture that is more based in physical modifications,  flying cars and sentient robot that  would become the  lower class citizens ( so we are missing all the cool stuff).

What do you think about all of this?"
"How To Eat Like A CyberpunkWe talk about the look of the Cyberpunk future, the neon signs and rainslicked streets, the trenchcoats and black leathers, usually hair partially shaved in weird designs due to neural jacks and other augments, weird tattoos or eyes or the like.

What I find myself wondering is the bits of the atmosphere that aren't usually shown, the life the people live in these worlds have.  This time, I am thinking food. Most Cyberpunk fiction goes about how the food sources are limited, usually loss of farmland due to ecological issues and/or human expansion. That makes fresh real food an expense that the normal working class person experiences infrequently with rarity depending on the world. It could be never to as little as once a month and treated like a dinner at a high class place or a special treat delivery order that you save for.

They'll usually be artificial food sources like lab grown mushrooms or a paste made from bugs or shrimp or similar for proteins. Lab grown substitutes that can then be flavored and shaped and made to be a burger or a slice of chicken. Some will have it being a slurry at the cheapest levels, like Kibble in Cyberpunk RPG or the Robocop bit where they have a rudimentary paste to maintain his organic systems and according to one exec it 'tastes like baby food'.

So, I got to thinking, we have a lot of similar food sources today that could probably be considered in that same category. I mean, we even have a Soylent meal replacement as life imitates art. Some discussions on this usually devolve into a collection of 'drugs (some prescribed, some illegal), energy drinks, ramen, any rodents and/or insects'. I do like this post from [the Shadowrun Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/7r1igg/sixth_world_supplements_cyberpunk_food/) that talks about how Taco Bell is a great example of Cyberpunk in the food industry, by turning an authentic culture's food to a bland essentially robotically designed and prepared food.

We've had TikToks making mashed potatoes using Pringles and regular bag chips as an example of what I imagine the sort of food making process would look like. Open a can or bag of machine processed items, dump some into a cooker. Add some flavoring (if not already added during manufacturing process) and you now have your daily slop. There are a few blogs like [this one](https://myriadwhimsies.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/seitan-for-carnivores-homemade-pseudo-meat/) doing recipes to try and approximate sci-fi food using modern ingredients. And there were events like Flooded, an early 2000s dinner event to show what would food be like if the oceans rose immensely, or The Next Menu from 2017 which was a post-apoc dinner from foods that would be available in that version of the future.  [This article on Grubstreet](https://www.grubstreet.com/2019/11/10-trailblazing-chefs-cook-the-food-of-the-future.html) has 10 cooks preparing what they felt would be 2029's food options. 

After all that lead in, I'm wondering what people today would consider the most Cyberpunk foods they could get their hands on. I would imagine a lot of it would be processed foods over non, probably mostly synthetic flavors. Maybe those vegetarian meat replacements as opposed to actual meat, or tofu with flavoring? Would it be chopped and served in noodles or a soup or would it be some whole glob of something?"
"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers. 

******************

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

"Study on perceptions of human and robot behaviors, $150 Amazon card drawing [mod approved]Greetings! 

I’m a professor at West Virginia University, and I’m conducting a research study on peoples’ perceptions of how humans and robots behave. Considering the role of machines in cyberpunk lit, I thought this group might be interested, so I’m posting to invite you to participate in this study. It takes ~20 minutes to complete by taking an online survey. 

In this survey, you’ll be asked to view or listen to a series of situations involve a robot or a human, and to give us your opinion on those situations. It is recommended that you **complete this survey on a laptop or desktop computer** rather than a phone or tablet, because you will be asked to stream some short audio/video and it will be easier to type out your responses. You should also use a device that has **audio and video capabilities** since you’ll be asked to listen to some short sound clips. 

Everyone who participates can opt into a random drawing for a $150 Amazon gift card. If you choose to opt into the drawing, you will be asked to enter your email address so you can be notified if you’re drawn as the winner. Your email will be kept completely confidential and will be deleted after the drawing is complete. The odds of winning the gift card depend on the number of participants. Please note that the incentive will only be delivered via a U.S. Amazon card, and you must be at least 18 years of age to participate.

"Kids Cartoons As Intro to Cyberpunk?I was part of a few discussions about 'I'm new to Cyberpunk, what do I need to know' or 'I want to expose my friends to the genre', and then someone mentioned how Zootopia is a perfect movie for intro to Cyberpunk as 

>The way the city and the story is put together it provides a good example of Cross-racial tensions, dealing with ethnic neighborhoods, the importance of contacts. It also shows classic and well designed examples of ""Just because he isn't the bad guy you thought, doesn't mean he's not almost as guilty"", ""Yes that's a Villain, but that one is on my side."", ""Power has nothing to do with stature and everything to do with influence and Brains.""

This got the OP to comment about how they could watch it with their kid and that got me thinking about what else could be Kid Friendly Cyberpunk. Lorax is a story about a city where the man in charge sells air, trees are plastic or electric, outside the city is a smog filled wasteland... and only one person can stand up to this oppressive regime and save them all. Not to mention, you have [a song that is all about the Corporate View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXlYuaycRbU) (though many prefer the [original Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpyuolKoeAY)) 

From there, there are a lot of 'Cyberpunk' children's shows depending on what you classify as Cyberpunk.  I tried to find ones that were more than just a story told in a City with some Neon.

* The Sonic SatAM and Underground were pretty entrenched in a dystopia controlled by one man looking to convert the whole world to cyborgs as they told the tale of the rebels fighting that force.
* Disney's Gargoyles had a lot of elements of the genre, as a group of gargoyles fight various criminal elements in the city to keep it safe from villains including a corrupt CEO, mad scientist, and a group of TV show action heroes turned criminals
* Phantom 2040 was a superhero in 2040 fighting Maximum Inc from seizing control of the city of Metropia
* Project G.E.E.K.E.R was a genetic shapeshifter experiment stolen before he could be made into a deadly weapon, now surviving on the run. The very first episode has a large floating mall going through the city.
* Batman Beyond is Batman in the future, various examples of technical villains as well as the futuristic world at large. For example one episode of about a consciousness living in computers, another about 
* Tron Uprising is inside the Tron world showing programs rebelling against the Clu program seen in the Tron sequel, and the 'futuristic' world inside the computer.
* RoboCop: The Animated Series is Robocop from the movies, but for kids.
* X-Men had a few cartoons in a 'modern' day of people with superpowers dealing with being the lowest class of society, where you have whole task forces hunting them down including the opening episode showing giant robotic Sentinels hunting a single mutant around, including through the mall.
* Zeta Project is in the same universe as Batman Beyond, future world where an assassin robot wants to be non-violent and peaceful and wants to find his creator to prove he can be normal. Think a sci-fi Pinocchio story.
* Samurai Jack has some episodes of the Samurai dealing with futuristic cities or other elements, like one has Robot Mobsters hunting him down
* Big Hero 6 is in San Fransokyo, a mix of American and European. The heroes use various tech to fight bad guys, including an evil Noodle Burger mascot as one of the cartoon's rogue's gallery
* Beast Machines is a Transformers sequel to Beast Wars, now they're back on Cybertron but its deserted so they explore the abandoned world to find clues exploring various technological elements as they try to save the planet
* Code Lyoko is kids trying to save their world from an AI using its powers to destroy the world by traveling to a virtual world to fight it.
* Highlander: The Animated Series has a new Highlander going around a post-apocalyptic 27th century to collect all the lost knowledge of man from Immortals who retired from the game, to use this knowledge to free them from the reign of one evil Immortal.

So there's a lot of options available for certain elements, some better skinned than others for sure. I mean, Code Lyoko is essentially a modern day story with the AI and virtual world elements, and Disney's Gargoyles is modern day with mythical elements like magic and various Shakespeare references like MacBeth and Oberon's Children. After making this list however, I may go to these and other kids shows for material as they can be more fantastical since they don't need to have any real set-pieces built for actors to interact with."
"You guys know images don't have to include neon and take place during night time for it to be cyberpunk, right...?"
"Stuff like Johnny Mnemonic?Rewatched Johnny Mnemonic recently and god that's a good movie.

I liked how pretty much everybody's cybernetic's had some major drawback, except maybe the Street Preacher's. Johnny had to dump some sentimentally important brain matter to make room for his brain implant, and of course his misuse of the tech was killing him thrughout the story. The body guard's implants gave her the black shakes, possibly, depends on who you ask. The dude with the laser wire thumb ultimately was killed with it.

But like, it wasn't in a ""Technology is evil"" way, imo. The system was the problem more than the tech itself.

I feel like that's something a lot of otherwise similar works lose sight of. Either it's just a completely uncritical fantasy about having a cool robot arm or it's some bullshit about how the robot arm taints your soul and makes you less human."
"Steampunk vs Cyberpunk Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction with a focus on ‘high tech and low life’. Most of the settings associated with this genre are set in an urban dystopian future. This genre mainly features advanced technological and scientific advancements associated with artificial intelligence, robotics and cybernetics. Let’s dive deep to understand what cyberpunk really is and what the differences between steampunk and cyberpunk are.

Steampunk also started as a subgenre of science fiction literature. Most of the premise for this genre is based on the 19th century Victorian era. It features some of the most important technologies of that time such as steam powered machines, clockwork and other industrial and electrical machinery. Steampunk authors try to reimagine the past but with better advances in technology using steam power.

"[Short story, series] Mecha SaviorEric Thompson scanned over his three computer screens, displaying the high-level dashboard for Unlimited Partners. He smiled as he contemplated the sea of green, with only a few scattered yellow areas. Near him hovered an executive intern, assigned for the day to trail Eric and learn what his job was like.

""So as you can see,"" Eric began, ""our madly daring idea is actually bearing fruit! Overall success depends on team-building; that's one of my specialties. But then the people I choose have to carry *that* on to the teams they build, and so on. All of these levels have to work, or the entire project could easily fail with speed."" He turned to look at the intern. ""There's no magic formula for accomplishing that; you have to be well-learned and thoughtful, you have to make your best judgment, then observe their results and see what needs to be changed, without succumbing to micromanagement. All I can say about my method is, I try to hire good people and then get out of their way. So far, it's working for me.""

""Very inspirational, sir,"" the intern chimed. ""I hope to contribute to that as much as possible. I believe this company has a bright future!""

Without warning, a red rectangle pushed its way onto his dashboard. Eric chuckled to himself. ""Right on time."" He clicked the high-priority emergency notification and began reading. Within moments, his eyes glazed over and his jaw dropped. The intern began to shiver uncontrollably. Blinking rapidly, Eric pondered who in the organization could handle this crisis.

His phone rang. He picked it up quickly; he didn't need to see who it was.

""What can you tell me about the intruder?"" Eric said anxiously.

""It's heading for downtown Milleniaburg!"" his security chief replied breathlessly. ""An old-school jet airliner hijacking. They had no trouble slipping through the porous security of what's left of the government forces.""

""Not a big surprise,"" Eric lamented. ""But why are they attacking *us*? What's their motivation?""

""Information is still patchy,"" the chief related. ""But the hijackers claim to be people we banished.""

""Then what's the point of attacking us?"" Eric pondered. ""It's not like they want to return; there's nothing for them here, unless they clean up their act. Which they clearly haven't done.""

""I don't think they're acting entirely rationally, sir,"" the chief offered. ""We have to treat this as an existential threat, not as something we can fix.""

""But what are our options?"" Eric pleaded. But he knew the answer.

""We only have one, sir,"" the chief replied sanguinely. ""We have to shoot it down.""

""But that would be a disaster!"" Eric objected. ""Our credibility is based on demonstrating a better way to run things. If we just kill them indiscriminately, it'll set our cause back, possibly permanently!""

Eric could hear the sorrow in the chief's voice. ""They'll be in downtown Milleniaburg in thirty minutes. I don't think we have a choice.""

Eric's eyes glowed with sudden revelation. ""I think we might."" His skin flushed red as he took a deep breath. ""OK, you prepare to shoot them down, but don't fire until they're seconds from impact! I'm going to try something.""

""Like *what*?"" the chief pleaded. But Eric had already hung up.

At a workbench, deep within the 16otaku complex, Stacy pondered the red robotic gladiator. ""OK, buddy,"" she chirped, ""show me what you got!""

In a single fluid motion, it flipped onto its back, extended its legs, and popped open its main access panel. Stacy scratched at the empty air above it. ""You want a belly rub? Who wants a *belly rub*?"" she cooed.

""Oh, come on,"" Irwin chided, as the blue robot gladiator did the same thing for him. ""They're only *partially* sentient.""

""You keep saying that,"" Stacy countered, ""but these two keep doing things we don't understand. That's why we're having this examination, remember?""

Irwin shook his head. ""Big Daddy is adamant that it's nothing he's changed. So it has to be a crossed wire, or some undetected damage, somewhere. I'm not buying your theories.""

Stacy removed the outer circuit board and gently laid it on the bench. ""After everything you've seen them do, how can you really believe that?"" She gaped at what she saw. ""*What* the—""

""What...?"" Irwin replied tersely as he finished removing the blue bot's outer circuit board, revealing what was inside. ""Oh...oh my...""

Nothing they were looking at was familiar. There wasn't an inner circuit board; it appeared to be a tightly-constructed melange of custom parts, the function of which they could only guess at. Even the shapes of the components were novel. Were they capacitors? Transistors? Semiconductors? Functions seemed to blur together in a kaleidoscope of odd shapes, running over and under other parts to form a complex, yet strangely regular pattern. Clear tubes intertwined with mechanical parts, conducting neural tissue throughout the volume.

""*We* didn't build this!"" Stacy gasped. ""*They* must have built it themselves!""

""But what does it do?"" Irwin pondered. ""I mean, obviously they're running themselves with this, but why this arrangement? It doesn't...oh, wait. Maybe it does.""

""What?"" Stacy watched Irwin walk over to her bench and look inside the red droid.

""I think I get it,"" he postulated. ""Step back and look at the arrangement as a whole, not as parts. What does it look like?""

""Kind of like..."" Stacy's brow furrowed. ""I don't know, a sponge?"" Suddenly her eyes lit up. ""It's a big shock absorber!""

""Exactly!"" Irwin trilled. ""We attach circuit boards with shock-absorbing mounts, but this takes it to another level!"" He pondered the intricate assembly for a moment. ""*Several* levels, actually. I've never seen *anything* like this.""

""Let's not sell it short,"" Stacy sniffed. ""We've never even *thought* of anything like this.""

Irwin continued to remove exterior panels on the blue bot. ""I think something like this would drive us mad before we got anywhere close to finishing. Plus, we'd need the design insights of a...a...""

""A supercomputer,"" Stacy finished. ""A really big one. Like what all the bots form at night, when they're left alone. Remember, we're only here eight hours a day; they spend a lot of time by themselves. Looking into everything they get up to when we're away would be its own full-time job. Well, several, at least.""

""Wow, would you look at this?"" Irwin had finished removing exterior panels, as the blue bot continued to lie there supinely. ""Even the exoskeleton is different!""

Stacy leaned in to look. ""The beams are thinner, more numerous, and...very finely machined."" She pushed on one gently with her finger. ""It's metal, but it almost feels rubbery. They've strengthened it with...geometry?"" She lowered a magnifier lamp over it, and dialed up the power. ""Look at the intricate patterns running along the length! I'm not even sure what they do!""

Irwin shrugged. ""Well, we can stop *this* part of the investigation. We've answered our original question; now we know how their fighting skills have improved so much recently. We can do the rest from our desks, querying the database about these new designs and how they work."" He turned to the blue bot. ""So are you willing to tell us all about it?"" The blue bot responded by rotating its primary sensor array towards Irwin and mimicking a salute. Irwin laughed. ""I'll take that as a yes!"" He turned to Stacy. ""Now the *real* discovery begins!""

Stacy sighed. ""Just as soon as we finish putting them back together.""

They heard a noise behind them. The red bot, carrying its outer circuit board, had crawled up to them. It proffered two of its front legs upwards. ""Do you want a boost, little guy?"" Stacy cooed. She lifted him up and put him on the workbench. It crawled closer to the blue bot and gently tapped Irwin's hand twice. ""Oh, you have this under control?"" Irwin laughed. The red bot immediately grabbed an exterior panel and began reconnecting it to the blue bot. Irwin and Stacy both stepped back.

Stacy looked puzzled. ""How are they operating with their outer circuit boards disconnected?""

Irwin's expression became thoughtful. ""That does mostly diagnostic operations. We need it to see how they're doing, but apparently *they* don't. I guess they have other methods!""

Stacy frowned. ""And somehow, this all escaped the notice of Big Daddy?""

Irwin shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't ask the right questions. But now *we* have a chance to!"" Irwin's eyes shone with wonder. ""This is bound to be a mind-blowing experience!""

Stacy looked beatific. ""Just one more thing I can't wait to learn about!""

Irwin smiled. ""Do you feel like a proud parent as much as I do?""

Stacy giggled. ""Yes! Our babies are growing up.""

Suddenly, Sam burst into the room. Stacy turned to him, smiling broadly. ""Wait until you hear what *we've* learned!""

""Never mind that!"" Sam shouted. Stacy and Irwin both froze. Sam tried to catch his breath. ""We have a *much* more pressing matter! I need you two at the cubicles, *now*!"" He ran off. Stacy and Irwin exchanged worried glances, then ran after him.

They arrived to find a video conference with Eric Thompson, already in progress. ""So you see what we're up against? We don't have any good options. Your work, in its present condition, is our only hope!""

Stacy tapped Dwight on the shoulder. ""What is he talking about?""

Dwight's eyes seemed to be filled with a sepulchral darkness. ""A jet airliner has been hijacked, and is headed our way. Eric wants us to try to stop it with a mecha.""

Stacy froze. ""Seriously?""

""All I want to know,"" Eric pleaded, ""is if there's a *chance*!""

""The rocket limbs have had a few controlled burns,"" Gary explained. ""They all worked as expected. But we haven't actually tried to fly it yet.""

Eric smiled. ""Well, today's the day! Are you up for it?""

""We've never even taken it *outside*!"" Isabel protested. ""In *theory*, it should work. All our tests have come back positive. But it's never been tried in the field!""

Eric wrung his hands. ""I'm sorry to ask this of you, but our backs are really up against the wall!"" He looked more unnerved than any of them had seen before. ""And I'm not going to sugarcoat this; you'll all be risking your lives. But a lot more lives hang in the balance, not to mention the success of our entire company! This is our make-or-break moment!"" He hung his head. ""I can't ask you to take this chance. You have to *choose* to.""

No one spoke. Then Dwight piped up. ""Some day I'll be an old man in a rocking chair on a porch, and I'll look back at this time...and if I don't act now, that old man is going to regret it and kick himself.""

""Yeah!"" Stacy exhorted. ""Let's *do* this!""

Sam could hardly contain himself. ""Then...I've always wanted to say this...*mecha pilots, assemble*!""

Gary, Dwight, Stacy, and Irwin, cheering loudly, ran for the hangar, the others close behind.

Eric turned his head; the camera followed to watch them leave. ""God speed, my brain-trust warriors.""

""How much fuel do we have on board?"" Gary asked breathlessly.

""Five hundred and twenty pounds,"" Dwight replied, gasping for air. ""We haven't refueled since our last burn.""

""No time now! What's our battery charge?""

""They should be full,"" Isabel answered. ""I left it plugged in.""

They arrived in the hangar. The four pilots ran off to their respective flight decks. The rest attended to the remote monitoring and diagnostic stations. ""Big Daddy!"" Sam shouted into the microphone. ""We're taking out the flying mecha. Are all systems go?""

""I heard about the hijacking, and the plan,"" Big Daddy answered in his usual sedate manner. ""All systems are go. My confidence is high. I just wish there was time to add fuel.""

Isabel threw a knife switch to raise the hangar door, as the various parts of the mecha powered on. ""Oh, heck,"" she said suddenly, as she ran towards the mecha, which was flexing its joints, doing its final tests. ""It's still plugged in!"" she yelled. ""I need a minute!""

Gary's voice squelched over the radio link. ""Uh...Sam? How do we get this thing outside? It's too tall for the hangar door.""

Sam stared blankly. ""Um...not sure. We've never tried it before.""

Isabel finished yanking out the assortment of extension cords, then high-tailed it back to her workstation.

Stacy's voice piped up. ""I think we have to crawl.""

The mecha lowered itself to the ground, and clumsily put its hands on the ground. After a few false starts, it began crawling towards the hangar door, its pace quickening as the crew got the hang of it. ""You know what they say,"" Dwight quipped. ""You have to crawl before you can fly.""

They reached the taxiway outside the hangar; unfamiliar sunlight poured into the mecha's sensors. Quickly, it adjusted to the new inputs, and gave its pilots a clear picture of their surroundings. Their mission computers all bleeped; the intercom link surged with Sam's voice. ""OK, I've linked you to the radar tracking of the bogey. We've got ten minutes until it reaches the outskirts of the city, and fifteen minutes until it reaches Unlimited Partners central HQ.""

Gary pondered the trajectory as Dwight fired the rocket limbs, preparing them for flight. ""We should be able to intercept it at the city's edge...but we're going to have to use our full thrust. This is going to be *really* rough. Are you all willing?""

All pilots answered affirmatively. ""Then off we go!"" Gary cheered as he slid all four thrust-power sliders to their maximum. The mecha shuddered uncertainly, slowly lifting off the ground, then wavered a little bit. As all four limbs pointed themselves down, in the same direction, suddenly it began picking up speed. It took off into the morning sky, piercing through the morning fog and vanishing.

""Aaaaah! I can't do this!"" Irwin yelled. ""I feel like I'm being crushed!""

""One moment!"" Gary yelled. ""OK, your suit should be extra pressurized now. Any better?""

""This really hurts!"" Irwin continued to scream.

""Keep screaming!"" Stacy yelled. ""It'll help keep you from blacking out!""

""She's right!"" Dwight interjected. ""Scream, tense up all your muscles, and hold in your stomach! We'll have to deal with maximum G forces until we get there!""

Irwin continued to scream; Gary turned down the volume on his intercom. ""As long as we can still hear him, it means he's OK. Some prior training for G forces would have been really helpful, but it's too late now.""

""Is this right?"" Stacy interrupted. ""Only seven minutes to intercept?""

""Sure looks like it,"" Gary agreed. ""The rocket-limbs are working really well. We're burning an awful lot of fuel, though. It'll take four hundred pounds just to reach the intercept point. I just hope Irwin can take it. Irwin, you hanging in there?""

""Aaaaaaaaaugh!"" Irwin continued to scream. ""I love iiiiiiiit! There's nothing else I'd rather doooooooo!""

Dwight was unconvinced. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""As long as he's still screaming, he's alive,"" Gary joked.

""He's fine,"" Isabel radioed. ""His vital signs are all good. Keep doing what you're doing, Irwin!""

""Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" he continued to yell.

""Can you imagine what they must be thinking on the ground?"" Stacy wondered.

""The anime fans are probably having a religious experience,"" Gary offered. ""Assuming they can see us.""

""That brings up an important issue,"" Dwight pointed out. ""What happens when the *hijackers* see us?""

""That depends,"" Gary offered. ""Are they going to be looking for a giant flying robot?""

""Uh...hmmm...good point. We'll have to hope we surprise them.""

The mecha continued to fly across the sky, angling upwards, its rocket-limbs spewing white-hot flames twice as long as its body. The mission computers had calculated that, given their current trajectory, that at the intercept point, they'd be five hundred feet above the airliner. ""I believe we can drop on them from above,"" Gary suggested. ""I think that's our best plan.""

""It's getting hot in here,"" Stacy observed. ""How's our cooling system?""

""Not yet running at full,"" Gary answered. ""I can turn them up. We should have sufficient battery power. Isabel?""

""You sure do,"" Isabel assured. ""You were charged to the top when you left.""

""I think I'm finally getting the hang of this,"" Irwin suddenly added, sounding strained.

""Glad to hear it, buddy!"" Gary chimed. ""I'm going to need your fine motor skills when we move to intercept. You ready for this?""

""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" Irwin gushed.

""Just keep up your G-force countermeasures,"" Isabel reminded. ""You're doing good, but don't relax them.""

""Not a problem,"" Irwin assured. ""They've become second nature.""

The rockets dropped their power slightly; the flight computers had adjusted the autopilot for the intercept. Gliding over the river that formed the northern border of the city, the mecha started to rotate in the air. Gary's voice filled the intercom. ""Hold on to your stomachs, people. This is going to feel really weird. Try not to get airsick.""

The mecha pivoted in the air, and pointed its limbs down, allowing it to hover. It came to a stop.

""The airliner is thirty seconds away, and we're seven hundred feet above it,"" Gary announced.

""And they don't *see* us?"" Stacy sounded incredulous. ""Not even on radar?""

""I'm not picking up any radar from them,"" Dwight observed. ""They must be operating on visual flight rules. Not a surprise if they're amateurs. They're probably just fixated on their target. Fortunately for us.""

The aircraft finally became visible on their external cameras. ""I'm ready for the intercept thrust,"" Gary announced. ""Irwin, you ready to grapple?""

""I was *born* to do this!"" Irwin exulted.

Gary counted down. ""Six...five...four...three...two...one...BURN!""

The mecha's limbs flung themselves back, and its rockets fired. The external cameras showed the plane approach; a few seconds before impact, its limbs swung down again, to slow its descent. With a loud, resounding crunch, the mecha impacted with the airliner. Quickly, its arms dove under the wings, and its hands met on the plane's roof, near the first-class section, putting the plane into a full nelson. Its feet pushed backwards, finding their grip on each side of the tail wing. A few tense moments passed.

""We're not stopping them!"" Gary shouted frantically. ""They've turned up their engines, and we don't have the fuel to use ours to slow them down!""

There was a few moments of silence. ""Can we kick our legs, like we're on a swing?"" Stacy suggested. ""If we can point the airliner upward, maybe we can get control of it.""

Gary sounded unsure. ""Irwin? Do the arms have a good grip?""

Irwin sounded confident. ""They're not going *anywhere*. Start kicking!""

The mecha's feet pulled themselves from the tail wings and began bucking wildly. Slowly, the airliner began to pitch upwards.

""I wonder what *this* looks like on the ground,"" Stacy asked sardonically.

Sam's voice, over the radio, feigned embarrassment. ""Um, well, when an airplane and a giant robot love each other *very* much...""

""It's working!"" Irwin suddenly exclaimed. ""Stop kicking! The airplane is in an aerodynamic stall. Its engines aren't enough to keep it in the air. Just a little bit of thrust from our legs, and we should be able to bring this unholy union to the ground!""

The mecha and airplane, locked in their hostile embrace, continued to plummet downwards.

""Why do you think the airliner hasn't cut its engines?"" Dwight asked. ""That would make our job a lot more difficult.""

""Maybe they didn't think of it,"" Gary suggested. ""We jolted them pretty hard when we hit; maybe they're unconscious.""

""Or maybe they're just panicking,"" Stacy wryly observed.

""Let's just hope our luck doesn't run out!"" Gary added. ""I think I can guide us to that empty field near the interstate. I'll try to slow down before we hit, but I can't guarantee anything. We're getting dangerously low on fuel. Brace for impact!""

On the ground, traffic on the interstate had come to a halt. People had left their cars to gawk at the garishly-colored spectacle plummeting towards them. As the airliner's jet engines continued to strain against its captor, the mecha fired its rockets in a finely-coordinated pattern, trying to steer them to the grassy plain, one of the few areas nearby that wasn't either trees or buildings. A few moments before reaching the ground, the mecha's leg-rockets suddenly flared brightly, slowing their descent and starting a few small brush fires. With a surprisingly gentle crushing noise, the airliner landed on the ground, the mecha still firmly attached to its top.

They continued to slide along the ground. ""Their engines are still firing! If we don't stop them, they'll drag us both into the river!""

""How about if I pinch their engines?"" Irwin offered. ""I'll have to let go with the arms, but I should be able to do this.""

""I think that's our best bet,"" Gary agreed. ""Do it!""

The mecha's arms let go. Quickly, it slid down the length of the airliner, but suddenly, the legs grappled the aircraft's sides, stopping its motion. Now in position, the arms reached towards the engines and crushed them with its hands. Jet fuel sprayed from the wounded turbines as the airliner and its giant passenger slid along the ground for several hundred more feet, finally coming to a stop.

The external microphones picked up a buzzing sound, growing louder. ""Where did the drones come from?"" Stacy asked. ""The highway?""

""That's it!"" Gary suddenly interjected. ""Irwin, rip the roof off of the flight deck! Let the drones take care of the hijackers!""

""You got it!"" The mecha shimmied up the length of the airliner; when it got near the front, its giant hands dug its fingers under the sides, peeling the roof back like a giant sardine can. Four hijackers stood in the exposed flight deck, gaping upwards in sheer terror. Quickly, the drones swarmed them; a few precisely-fired taser bolts later, and they all collapsed to the ground.

""YOU DID IT!"" a voice on the radio yelled. More cheering could be heard in the background. Stacy reacted with surprise. ""Wait, was that Eric Thompson?""

""It's me, and everyone else at headquarters!"" Eric answered. ""Plus several million more viewers on TV.""

""Wow,"" Stacy stammered. ""Way to bury the lede there, boss.""

""Are you kidding?"" Eric gushed. ""We wouldn't have missed this for the world!""

""Uh..."" Irwin began. ""Glad to be of service?""

The external microphones now picked up the cheers of the passengers. The emergency doors had opened, the exit chutes had inflated, and passengers were sliding out of the stricken aircraft as quickly as they could. Most of them gawked at the giant robot, which continued to sit astride the airplane, like a brightly-colored cowboy on a white horse. A few had run off, to stamp out the small brush fires caused by the mecha's rockets.

The external cameras showed the highway, the passengers having left their cars en masse. All were cheering and clapping.

""Did we actually live through that?"" Irwin's voice gasped weakly. ""The adrenaline is wearing off. I think I'm going to lose it.""

""Permission to lose it granted,"" Sam jokingly intoned. ""You've all done a great job.""

""You know what would be awesome?"" Dwight piped up. ""We should fly away from here, back to base, and salute in the air for everyone on the highway.""

""Not going to happen,"" Isabel related over the radio. ""You only have thirty pounds of fuel left.""

""Can we siphon anything from the airliner?"" Stacy asked.

Isabel paused for a moment. ""You don't have anything to siphon with,"" she sighed. ""We never thought to add such an attachment.""

""Then what do we do?"" Dwight pined. ""We can't just lay here and wait for a big flatbed to pick us up. That'd be embarrassing!""

""There's a truck stop about two miles down the highway,"" Sam offered. ""Diesel fuel is close enough to aircraft fuel for the mecha's systems. And between your remaining battery power, and the internal generators, you have enough power to..."" Sam paused for a moment. ""To walk there.""

""Well, I guess that'll still look pretty cool,"" Dwight agreed reluctantly. ""But not what I was hoping for.""

Gary's voice crackled over the mecha's loudspeakers. ""Citizens, please give me some space. I need to leave."" The passengers obediently formed a wide circle around the mecha. Slowly, it moved to stand up and dismount the airliner, to the cheers of everyone nearby. Unsteadily, the mecha walked towards the highway; the circle of people parted to let them through.

""Blast off! Blast off!"" the kids yelled, picked up by the external microphones. ""See, I knew they'd want that,"" Dwight sighed. ""We need to plan better in the future.""

Gary's voice once again blared from the loudspeaker. ""Sorry, kids. Not enough fuel. But maybe next time!"" All four pilots could hear their disappointed whines. Gary continued. ""Hey, c'mon, kids! I'm still a giant flying robot!"" The kids quickly began cheering again. The mecha slowly, clumsily walked away.

""OK, I think our autopilot can handle this,"" Gary declared. ""Just watch for sinkholes or loose soil.""

As they neared the highway, the disembarked passengers continued to cheer and clap. The mecha stopped and stood there. The loudspeaker crackled once again with Gary's voice. ""Citizens, please move your vehicles. I have to get home."" They finally stopped cheering, went back into their cars, and got out of the way. The mecha crawled up the embankment, walked across the lanes of traffic, and began trudging down the highway in the slow lane. Cars slowly drove past it, horns honking and passengers whooping, before driving off. The mecha occasionally saluted, to even louder cheers.

The customers at the truck stop could hear the rhythmic clanking noise from quite some distance away. As the mecha approached, most of them just stood and stared, their mouths gaping. The mecha walked into the parking lot, picked a row of interior pumps, and stood there, waiting. The loudspeaker flared again. ""Don't mind me, citizens. I just need fuel. I'll wait in line.""

The two truckers that were next in line made several animated arm gestures, then each got into their trucks, started them up, and moved to back up. The mecha backed up too, getting out of their way. Deftly, the trucks slithered past each side of the mecha, smoothly arriving back in their lanes. ""Thank you, citizens!"" the loudspeaker blared.

Slowly, the mecha lowered itself onto its hands and knees. From there, it shifted to a prone position, and began to army-crawl between the rows of gas pumps. The clanking and scraping made a ferocious noise that caused many onlookers to cover their ears. Finally, the mecha was in position, and the steady hum of its power shut down, leaving behind a ghostly silence.

A few moments passed. Then the sides of each limb opened up, and the pilots exited, lowering themselves gingerly to the ground. As the onlookers continued to gawk, the pilots nonchalantly pulled out their company credit cards, swiped them at the pumps, then each removed a gas cap and put the diesel spouts into the exposed fuel filler.

The trucker opposite Dwight stammered. ""Uh...er...um...what kind of mileage do you get in that thing?""

""I'm not sure,"" Dwight answered. ""We just burned about five hundred pounds; that got us a total of about fifteen miles. We used a lot less fuel during free-fall, though.""

""Free-fall?"" the trucker replied weakly. ""Buddy, you must have horseshoes in *both* pockets.""

A few families had crowded around Irwin. ""How do you become a giant-robot pilot?"" one kid asked.

""First, you have to invent it,"" Irwin answered. ""I'm part of the team that built this. We have two more back at our lab.""

""Do they fly too?"" The kid's eyes burned with adoration.

""Not yet, but after today, I'm sure we'll add it soon!"" The kid looked disappointed. Irwin continued. ""But...you know what they *can* do? Kung fu battle! Just like in the movies!"" The kid gaped wordlessly.

""What company do you work for?"" a man asked. ""Who is in the giant-robot business?""

""I'm with a research-and-development division of Unlimited Partners,"" Irwin answered. ""And we do a lot more than just giant robots.""

""Well, I'm sure glad you do!"" the man exulted. ""That was fine work, stopping that hijacking. Can you believe the government hasn't even released a statement on it? I think they're too humiliated.""

""I haven't had time to catch up on the news,"" Irwin explained. ""I'm sure I will...once I fly back to the office.""

""That's right, ladies — you *too* can become a giant-robot pilot!"" Stacy happily explained to a throng of Girl Scouts, hanging on her every word. ""And I don't just fly it; I helped *design* and *build* it! But you'll need to stay in school, study hard, and keep out of trouble! Jobs like these only go to the best! And *you* can make it this far, if you just apply yourselves!""

""We will!"" they cheered as they ran off to get back in their vans.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that,"" the den mother told Stacy.

""No problem, I get it,"" Stacy answered. ""I know the Girl Scouts are for at-risk children. Hopefully they stay inspired.""

The den mother glanced at the mecha, her eyes filled with wonder. ""If *that* doesn't inspire them...*nothing* will.""

A thin, gangly man in business-casual left the shop and approached Gary, a stunned look on his face. Gary turned and smiled. ""Are you the manager?"" He tried to answer, but couldn't find his voice; finally, he just nodded vigorously.

""What's the pre-authorization limit on these pumps?"" Gary asked nonchalantly.

""Uh...ummm...seventy five gallons,"" the manager stammered.

""Can we all get authorized for about a thousand gallons each? We have a long flight home.""

""I...um...yes. I'll...go do...that."" The manager walked off, looking behind him one last time before disappearing inside the shop.

As the mecha continued to fuel, Dwight walked up to Stacy. ""So...before the next time...*rubber shoes*.""

Stacy laughed. ""I know, right? I though the *flight* was bad...the walk was easily *twice* as bad! I think my bones are still shaking.""

""And rubber knee pads and elbow pads, too.""

""Yeah...I'm not looking forward to fixing all those scrapes. But can you imagine it? The mecha will look like a roller-derby player! How awesome would *that* be?"" Stacy looked at the mecha, grinning impishly. ""How about retractable inline skates? The *heck* with all this walking!""

""Oh yeah, huh?"" Dwight agreed. ""I guess there are some ideas that don't occur to you unless you try the thing in the real world."" Dwight looked at the mecha's back. ""And why the heck don't we have a giant flaming sword?""

The four pilots continued to field questions, and receive congratulations, as the pumps slowly filled up the mecha. Finally, they put the spouts back, replaced the gas caps, and climbed back inside their respective flight decks, giving the crowds one last thumb's up before disappearing inside, to the din of their hails and cheers.

The mecha powered up, its electric hum making the air shake. This brought on another round of applause and whooping. It slowly army-crawled from under the canopy, back to unobstructed space. The metallic screeching and scraping sound silenced the crowd quickly as they covered their ears and winced.

""*Oh* my God,"" Irwin began. ""I haven't dealt with so much of the public in my *life*!""

""I heard *that*!"" Stacy added. ""This was fun once, but if there are any more public appearances, I think we need to use gregarious pilot types. I thought the *battle* was tough...having to deal with people was *much* more draining!""

""Hey Gary, once we're out, can we launch with only three of the rockets?"" Dwight asked. ""I really want to try a salute as we leave.""

""I think that'll be safe,"" Gary answered. ""But don't try anything fancy. Just one salute and we're done.""

""Not a problem,"" Dwight laughed. ""I'm willing to start small.""

The mecha walked to the far end of the complex's parking lot, away from the people, trucks, and anything flammable. After turning to face the crowd, its leg rockets ignited, along with one arm. As the mecha launched into the sky, its free arm moved to salute, before dropping that arm down and firing the last rocket. The exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but the rockets made too much noise to hear them.

The flight back to their airport was uneventful and leisurely. There was no need to use full rocket power; all the pilots had had enough of high G forces for one day.

The mecha neared the airport. The exterior cameras showed that huge crowds had formed on either side of the runway. The radio suddenly crackled to life. ""Welcome back, robo-nauts!"" Eric Thompson's voice gushed. ""You're all heroes!""

""Oh, man,"" Gary answered. ""I hope you don't expect us to deal with any more people. All we want to do is collapse."" The mecha moved to land upright.

""Not a problem,"" Eric assured them. ""You just need to land and crawl back inside. We'll deal with the press.""

""Thanks, boss,"" Gary replied, with great relief in his voice. ""The truck stop was agonizing, but we didn't know what else to do."" The mecha landed gently on the ground; the exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but they couldn't be heard over the roar of the rockets.

""I understand completely,"" Eric commiserated. ""And rest assured, you all get the rest of the day off. Well, after a full medical exam. We want to make sure you're intact.""

The mecha got down on its hands and knees. ""So do we,"" Gary agreed. ""We're just glad to have survived.""

""So am I,"" Eric answered sanguinely. ""And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about the reaction. Lots of nonpublic stuff. You all did more good today than you can possibly imagine.""

The mecha crawled through the hangar door. ""That's fine...but *tomorrow*. We need a break.""

""You've earned it,"" Eric agreed. ""Have a good evening.""

The hangar door closed behind the mecha, the loud clang reverberating across the runway."
"[Opinion] Why Japan is NOT Cyberpunk (And why 2nd and 3rd world countries should be)As i noticed in the past couple of years, people misinterpret Neon lights, Japanese Text, and sexy robotic girls as ""Cyberpunk"". Cyberpunk is the idea of Low Standards of living meets high technology integrated within a society. Japan isn't one of them. Japan has a 0% poverty rate, enough housing for its entire population, On par on education with the rest of the first world countries, a stable government body, and Crime rate at an all time low. Japan is High Tech, High Life and thus Japan shouldn't fit ""Cyberpunk"" idea. It should be designated as ""Cyberprep"" instead as due to it being stable for all occupiers in the country from all levels of society .  I do believe however that another country fits the moniker of ""Cyberpunk"" : The Philippines.   


The Philippines is the closest one could get to experiencing the world of Blade Runner or any Cyberpunk Media out there (Particularly in the streets of Manila). I've lived in Manila for about 14 years and it definitely fits the bill of ""High Tech Low Life"". One side of the City is extremely Rich but take a 30 min walk and you end up in Payatas or ""Smokey Mountain"". A dumping ground where all the garbage of the city end up. Trees growing from broken pieces of Computer Junk, The poor owning Touch Screen Smart Phones in Ram Shackled Slums with Designated Coded Numbers for ""Barangays"" or  Subdivisions on the Slums. Coin Operated Internet Cafes, Playing games like Crossfire and other Low Spec games on Office Computer Rigs held together in Wooden Cabinets and Dust Laden Duct Tape. Mean while, hundreds of corrupt politicians and police harass the poor. Staged Cleanup events for Politicians to gain leeway in elections, Graffiti everywhere, Rugby Glue Snorting addicts at overpasses, Streets Smell of Piss and Shit, and Neon Lights in the centuries old Binondo, China Town. The Philippine government always tries to highlight the more glamorous parts of the country in the other islands, ""Off World"" you could say. However, everyone who ever went to Manila would know that the entire City is the Definition of Cyberpunk"

A hard boiled freelance detective for the Federal Bureau of Cyberneurics. David recalls Rustin Cohle, Joe Miller, Jimmy McNulty, Sherlock Holmes with a shot of Christian Bale on the rocks.

David is a caucasian male in his late forties, approximately six feet two inches. Some long line of introspective European, maybe German or Jewish. He is medium built with coiled muscles and razer reflexes from prior military training and cardiovascular exercise. He has a gaunt angled face framed with stiff black hair just beginning to edge grey. His nose, bent from too many bar fights, watches over chapped and sealed lips. His eyes are hollow almond, the kind that wish they were somewhere else. He wears a prussian blue work suit which hasn’t been ironed in a while and a coffee-stained dress shirt.

Loss drives David, loss of his daughter. He spends his days remorsing on her death and his nights searching for her killer. All the while drowning in the closest drink. After his daughter’s death David had her neural network digitally entombed, the demi-soul of her thoughts now dwelling on a cerebral implant inside his head. He wants his daughter back but knows he can never have that. He harbors burning vengeance for the one who took his daughter away for him but six long years of searching have brought him no closer. His is a relentless pursuit of truth.

David is a rowboat of self-inflicted rage amid a tempest of sorrow. David keeps mostly to himself and has trouble trusting the intentions of others. Experienced at sensing the order of things, David focuses on objective facts and patterns to solve crimes. Everything is processed through logical filters and his curiosity is often more interested in finding answers then the answers themselves.

It is not that David won’t stop and momentarily contemplate the taunt wet curves of the stripper at the bar. But it always comes back to the pointlessness of it all which prevents him from forming human connections.

Politically, David supports the Hegemony because the Hegemony supports his paycheck. He knows the government does bad things but, the way he sees it, it is not his problem. Whether it is this party in power or that one makes little difference. David holds much the same beliefs on religion.

He was sold at the outskirts of the Mojave irradiated zone to the Keays Boys. The savages brought him to the trash mesa ruins of San Diego. They forced him into the mechanic trenches, but under the encouraging touch of thorn whips, Eli found he had a gift. He was adept at turning rusting metal into diesel-spitting machine. His cars, whether screaming past salt-flat speedways or pillaging neighboring tribes, always seemed the fastest. On his name day he was sold to the Boss for work on the warlord’s personal mech walker. He spends his days tinkering with gatling machine guns and squeezing every ounce of horsepower out of turbine engines. 

Eli is a calm wind over scorching desert. He has a serenity that comes from having everything taken away. He seeks a harmony with nature and shows a gentleness towards lingering life. But buried underneath that is loathing and fury for what his tormentors have done to him. He is independant save for the shackles that bind him, yet dependable, pragmatic and tenacious. In his mind what separates mankind from beast is values, chief among them honesty and justice and he judges others by this same code of honor. 

Eli is a heterosexual man. At an early age his genitals were mutilated both to boost testosterone for cage fights and render slaves unable to reproduce. David’s religion prohibits sexual desires outside of marriage and he is quick to temper errant thoughts. David, despite being a lone wolf, longs for a family some day.

Eli is an outsider. All he has ever known is gang tyranny and tribal castes. Eli believes deeply in the shamanistic creed of his birth, loosely translated as the Quake Brotherhood. This religion preaches that a prophet will come some day to reclaim the earth and only those who follow the rituals strictly will be saved. Eli has practiced these rituals in secret for many long years.


***Neo Angeles***


**The Towers**

Neo Angeles. Founded circa 2058 in the still cooling radioactive ash of old Los Angeles, the city was an amalgamation of constructed mountains and excativated canyons. On a clear day, from the outskirts of the Mojave Irradiated Zone you could just make out the Towers gleaming against the bay. Massive citadels formed from titan alloy skeleton and indomitable granicrete core, these mammoth institutes formed the foundation upon which humanity's future would be built or her soul finally crushed. There were seven towers. 

Lakshfi, Vault of Prosperity, home of the banking guilds and mega finance firms, was bedecked opulent golden whirls on decadent silver, her enormous clockface rang constantly trading marketplace cash, commodities and wealth from the Trans-African Republic to the Russian Confederacy. Anbal, High Seat of Justice, adorned marble columns with blind lady justice overwatching, in her halls the Judicators safeguarded the populace from unrelenting lawlessness. Seshrat, The Bureaucratic Monolith, tubule stylus where legions of unnamed bureaucrats churned the gears of society. Genaea, Birthplace of Gen-gineering, verdant helix whose spiraling terraces overflowed with designer vegetation and rejuvative stemcell tanks. Budyha, The Happy Corporation, supplier of franchised acme products worldwide, cartoon animations dancing along prismatic cubic surfaces. TyrX, NanoRobotic Industries, an ominous scarlet ziggurat, empty scarab husk abandoned since the Drone Wars.

The last Tower, Irez, rose above the rest. Her triangular heights crawling with vid screens and vox speakers. Pinnacle crowned satellite array broadcasting Pan-China syndicated programming. Irez was the nexus for the Neuro Electronic Terminus and it was said those working in the server bunkers underneath Irez could still feel the vibrational dreams of all those lost in the NET. 


**The Boxes**

The Boxes were the labyrinth sprawl at the foot of the Towers, a concrete jungle of condominiums squares and overlapping residential zones. Make enough credits and you live in a penthouse in the Highrizers. Don’t make enough and you sleep in an individual coffin bed slotted next to a couple hundred of your neighbors. For everyone in between there was the apartments. A billion people lived her, all struggling to find purpose among rampant commercialism, racial divides and a society become machine. 

The residential zones were checkered against the ever busy commercial sectors where your happiness was only a price tag away. Mega-malls, prefabricated chain stores and retail outlets reproducing at the limits of supply and demands. Here buzzing stream of delivery drones ferry online orders to the convenience of home. 

Interconnecting the residential zones and the commercial sectors was an expansive web of bridge, magnetic track and hoverway. The major transit hubs pumped the citizen lifeblood to the city through pneumonic hyperloops. Supersonic flights continuously taking off and landing at Asimove International. Perched on the hill overlooking the airfields was a lone X-21 Traveler, the launchpad on darkened lockdown since the moon colony went dark. Streams of fishing trawlers, cargo freighters, juvenile sportscraft and private yachts filtered through the cities two ports, North Marina and Rancid Harbor. 

At the northern end of the Boxes was Gates University, you did well in primary schooling, you went to Gates with a chance at a better life someday. Next door was the Neo Angeles Archival Library, buried in those dusty mainframes were stories from before the Fall and even the occasional banned religious texts. Nearby Genaea Memorial, High Cross and Children’s heals those with priority insurance. Those more indigent queue for St. Bellevue, coughing in the exhaust from the Infirm Crematoriums. 

The Boxes, for all it’s toil was not without its points of pleasure. In the Art district were the Grand Aero Theater, Bard Studioway, the Hover Speedway, and the Rave Circuses. The Entertainment Complex humed with upscale nightclubs, aroma restaurants, and the privilege casinos. Hybrid Gardens was home to reanimated birds and beasts from the extinct wild, now thriving in a photosynthetic jungle. Lakeshore Hills to the south offered serenity living for country club suburbanites. Vacation Island, pristine beach resort of the Elite, rested just offshore. And not to be forgotten was the theme park Budyha Land, family centric incorporated fun for all paying customers.


**The Industrial Pits**

Beneath the Boxes were kilometer deep bore holes penetrating the earth’s crust. Hollowed out shortly after the Twenty Minute War, they were originally intended to serve as massive fallout shelters for the city populace. However, they had since become dark fallen places where societies most undesirable seemed to settle. The poor, villainous and lost condemned to a subterranean life sentence. 

The Tech Caverns housed the massive nuclear facilities and hydroponics plants, life support for surface side. Augs, those who had chosen cybernetic enhancement for medical or cultural reasons were shunned by society but welcome in the engineering communities down here. The Indentured, civilians who sold their rights for protection, food and shelter, worked laborious and short lives in factory towns. Slugs, those addicted to drugs or virtual stimulation litered the sewer tunnels down here. Among these factory towns were the ethnic enclaves, Little India, Euroburg, Asiatown and Latinville, each with a dedicated crime family engaged in all out gang warfare amid ghetto squalor. 

Descend down a level and you would find the Subterrestrial Farms, growing luminescent biovats, gengineered plantations and meat slime nurseries. Harvesting drones nurtured and protected these pitch black fields from the hungry. The deepest abyssal Pits were mostly unknown. Hole 64 was a black site prison restricted to the most craven criminals and their machine wardens. Hole 51 was omega classified, some say it collapsed long ago, some say it contained pre-Fall relics. Those who said anymore, disappeared.  

"
"Would you consider going full prosthetic ie. Ghost in the Shell?Before you answer, take everything into consideration. This is a life changing decision, and while most of you reading this would probably say you would jump at the chance, take a few minutes to really think about what you would do if/when you are presented with this options.

This is a **voluntary** procedure with a full body prosthesis. You were not injured, and no one is forcing you to do it. The only natural remains you will have will be the organics in your cyber brain, everything thing else will be prosthetic, Your body is over 90% artificial.   

And for funsies, lets just say you are you, at your current profession, financial position, location, etc. just with the option of swapping out your body. 

Now, there are obviously some benefits to such a body, but there are also some drawbacks and some things that could fall into both.

I mean, think about it, you can literally get an upgrade to yourself. You are now stronger, faster, quicker, more flexible than you could have even been as a human. Your new body could be so resilient to damage that you could probably stand up to bullets! And hell, even if you couldn't, you could turn off your pain receptors and simply replace the part that was damaged. Hell, that's not even going into the weapons systems and military applications you could have installed, either legally or not. 

Your organs are all artificial, so you no longer have to worry about disease or damaged arteries, and in-fact your circulatory system is better than ever! You could have such amazing stamina you would run for hundreds of miles without stopping. Your new lungs could filter through pollution and your stomach and kidneys can filter of such toxins, that you could probably drink bleach and be fine. Shit, your body isn't fleshy anymore, so you'll just flat out live longer.

But things like alcohol and drugs no longer work. Your advanced artificial organs filter them out without much trouble.

Your senses are now digital. This could be a mixed bag, depending on your opinion. You could have incredible telescopic sight with UV and Infared filters and be able to hear a bumblebee from a mile away, but your tastes are severely limited, if not gone completely. You now have to subsist mostly off ""cyborg food"". You could have such a high tactile sensor per nanometer count on your skin, so that you have more advanced touch that a human...

But it's all digital. It's not real in the classically defined way. Maybe someone couldn't cope with that? This body is not the one you grew up with. It may look like you, hell, you could make it look like anything you want! It could be such a close facsimile of your that your own mother couldn't tell you had the procedure until you tell her. Your eyes aren't real anymore. Your skin isn't real anymore. All those scars your collected from climbing trees and fighting and being stupid with your friends are gone. Your arm doesn't hurt in the cold anymore. You probably don't even remember what an ""itch"" is. That birthmark you had is gone, unless you specifically ask to keep it. 
But then, theres always having trouble learning to control your new body. Sure you can crush rocks with your bare hands and bend steel, but try lifting an egg or holding a child (Speaking of which, natural conception is now gone. If you want a child, you'd have to go adopt or seek special assistance). For you in a delicate profession (For example, I'm a cartoonist), this could potentially be a deal breaker. But psssh, you can learn to control it, right? And with the offset with the digital precision and steadiness your new body allows, maybe your now *better* at your job. Your keystrokes are beyond comprehension! You don't need no stinkin' forklift! Surgery is no longer a challenge for you in the medical field. Just download the procedure and you're better than an assembly robot.

Maybe that sounds awesome to you. Maybe to someone else, those little faults make you feel human. Then you'll need to worry about the possibility of being body hacked and infiltrated. Your cyberbrain makes you connected to the net at all times, but now it's not your laptop that could get fried, it you.

But that's just the physical issues. Existentially, Theseus' Ship comes into play. Can you really call this new body YOU if there is barely anything left that you used to identify as you? Do you believe in a soul/ghost? At what point would be considered no longer human and are just a robot. If your brain (already heavily cyberized) is controlling nothing but mechanical lungs and limbs, what differs you from that android in the corner there? This could also make you the target of people who see you as an abomination. No longer human, and abomination. Could you handle that burden?


Now there are definitely some pros and cons I had forgot to include, but I want you to seriously think about this as if it was real decision, cause it will be one day, and don't make that rash ""FUCK YEA, CYBERPUNK!"" and jump on board. 

Would you become a cyborg?"
"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"Are Cyberpunk scenarios 'bad'? Are we living in one?Hi! How are you all doing?

I'd like to expand here a discussion I had with a friend a few weeks ago. I'm preparing a cyberpunk roleplaying campaign, which led me to investigate and consume a lot of material on this genre. One night, I was talking with a friend about how most of the distinctive traits of Cyberpunk are already part of our lives, but are not that prominent. He denied everything and said I was 'acting paranoid', which may be the case, but I think the discussion is worth sharing with you. 

It all started when I said that I use External Hard Drives to back my data. No, I'm not actually talking about pirated movies/shows, but about stuff. I like to write and draw, and as such, I've been creating a lot of content through the years. I also like to take photos of things, record videos, do podcasts, etc. Pair that with content that I legally have the right to own and don't want to lose (e.g.: Podcasts that are no longer available to download, personal stuff, etc), I decided to keep backups of it. He said I could always find most of it on the Internet anytime, to which I replied that I don't, because some of it is already gone, and who knows if I'll really be able to do so in 10 years. We don't know how things are going to be. 

He said that the collapse of Internet as we know it would mean we're getting into real world Cyberpunk, and I said that in a way, every element of Cyberpunk worlds were already part of our lives. To name a few.


* **Technology infected everything.** I say infected not because it's a bad thing, but because it's almost impossible to escape it. Smartphones are such powerful devices that I think most people don't realize what can be done with them. With a few touches on a screen you can order a pizza, pay your bills, read the news of a foreign country, watch events on real time, and educate yourself while you're on public transport. You get home and there's a powerful computer where you can do this and much more, and pretty much everyone has one. Thanks to technology, we are more powerful than ever, and more connected than we ever were: If I need a text translated to Chinese by tonight, I can find a translator with a few clicks, pay him with a few more clicks, and in a few hours my order is done. Tell that to 10yo me during the 90s, he wouldn't believe a word of it.

* **Corporations Are Everywhere**: I don't wanna get all Mr. Robot with you, but they really are everywhere. Not that that's a bad thing in itself, but Corps are way bigger now than they ever were, and they do have a certain degree of control over us. How many times have we actually stopped to read the Terms and Conditions before accepting them? Remember the issue with the Cookies a few years ago. Now every website requires you to accept that, and if you don't do it, you can't keep reading it. To get paid at your job, you almost always need a bank account, to which you give a lot of your personal data. To get called for said job, you need a phone, which also requires some data and payment.

* **Saturation of media**: This one is my favorite. I was a columnist for a videogames magazine a few years ago, and one of the things that baffled me more was how many options of entertainment people have and how that clouds their judgement. I mean, it's great to have so much to choose from, but we live in the Hype Era and as soon as you're not up to date with everything, you're out of the loop and feel lost. How many good games are released each month? Do you have the time and money to play all of them? On top of books, shows, movies, etc?. Back when I was a kid, we were lucky if we got 3 games a year (one on your birthday, one on Christmas, and a 3 one if your grades were good. Also you were doomed if you birthday was near Christmas!). For that reason we were used to taste each game/movie/etc, to savor it, instead of mindless consuming it as fast as possible before switching in for the next 'best thing ever'. 

The Internet is the queen of this. We see so many amazing things that we are not impacted by it anymore. We favorite and forget it, and vow to 'one day try it', but we never do. 


The breaking point was that my friend insisted that these things weren't really Cyberpunk, 'because Cyberpunk scenarios are bad, and our world isn't'. I'm not even getting started on the whole 'our society is nowhere close to being good', but, what makes Cyberpunk worlds actually 'bad'? Is it that their people are dependent on technology, like us? Is it that their existence is mindless, just like a lot of people today are, dissatisfied with their jobs and living 'just because'? Corporations control everything and technology changed the way our daily lives are? That doesn't seem very far from true.

I think the main point people miss is that there isn't going to be a 'turning point'. We won't say ""Oh, now we're getting Cyberpunk"". Cyberpunk always seems to be a bit ahead in the future, no matter the year we are. No matter what happens, no matter the amount of robots in dark alleys with neon lights and rain over kanji (/s), we will always say 'Oh, but this is not a dystopia, things could be worse.""

I'm not saying we ARE Cyberpunk right now. I'm saying we could be, and most people still wouldn't realize it. What do you think?
"
"Musicianship in a cyberpunk worldI know in reality we listen to certain electronic music and call it ""cyberpunk music"" because it evokes the themes or atmosphere of a work of cyberpunk fiction... But I'm curious about what you could call the inversion of that.

My question: in a cyberpunk world, what is it like to be a musician?  Obviously, the answer can vary depending on the particulars of the setting. 

Here's a list of elements I'd expect from cyberpunk musicianship:

* Matrix jam sessions. Jack in and have a jam session with your buds. Play whatever instrument you can think of/code up.  Save samples from the jam and mix them into new songs in minutes.

* A vast majority of meatspace instruments would be electronic and mid-tier and above might have a mini-deck in them to interface with the grid, for holo broadcasting live music.

* Mass-produced instruments would be easy to play, but would be very limited. Like a midi keyboard that can only play notes in one key, and automatically do only chords in that key. In these cases, musicianship is dumbed down so that anyone can play some notes that sound okay together.

* Cyberpunks might build their own instruments that would also be electronic but, like MIDI instruments today, are capable of playing many different notes. Would be similar in function to the mass produced shit but the notes would be digitally-synthesized by the creator of the instrument. The sound would be highly distinct from mass-produced instruments but would not allow for very much expressiveness from the player.  These would be the low-medium tier instruments.

* Expert cyberluthiers might integrate high-density touchscreens into the instrument that allows for higher-definition input. This would approximate an analog electronic instrument like an electric guitar.

* ""Old-fashioned"" electronic instruments would be easy to make, but would require also using an Analog-digital-converter before being usable in pretty much any modern application. So, they exist but are pretty much just a hobby project for interested musicians.

* The only acoustic/brass/woodwind instruments anyone sees anymore on a regular basis belong to CEOs, who have carefully manufactured androids to play them.  Naturally, these androids sound technically skilled and precise but are missing the subtle, indescribable expressiveness of a real human virtuoso. If memory serves, this sort of lacking was described in Big O about a robot pianist.

Of course these are just my expectations. What are yours?"
"Mute (2018) - short reviewSummary:

Leo is an mute whose condition could be cured if not for the fact that his family was Amish.  He works as a bartender; or worked, because he gets fired for attacking a customer (who harassed his girlfriend the waitress).

The next day his gf doesn't show up, and he starts looking for her by following some clues. Apparently his gf had some other stuff going on, and it doesn't look legal.

But without a voice and without tech know-how, will he be able to find her? He's one man against the world.

Now, for my opinion. 

The cyberpunk element here is more than anything, the backdrop for a neo Noir story. It could as well take place in say, modern Chicago, but for some reason the author decided to place it in a near future. Unlike other cyberpunk movies, there's no obvious sociopolitical issue driven by technology. No brain implants, no remote controlled bodies, no sentient robots to hunt, so don't expect questions about the nature of man, free will and the human mind. Nah. It's the same stuff but with drones, flying cars, and Neon. New tech, same shit.

(As for the premise, it's interesting how technology here causes problems for those unwilling to depend on it; I can't help comparing it to Altered Carbon; just as Catholics rejected the idea of resurrection,the Amish just reject technology in general, and this makes them crippled and unprepared for the world.)

Over all, it's an interesting thriller that gets more intense as the movie advances; it doesn't NEED to be cyberpunk, but it just is.

I give it an 8 out of 10."

"Discussion Topic: AII'd love to start a discussion about AI and how it will change the way humans think about a single subjective.

Specifically, AI that is at or very near the sophistication of human intelligence and cognitive ability; basically, the ability to mimic human consciousness. There is a famous experiment in which a researcher was able to fool subjects into believing that they were communicating with another human behind a closed door. In fact, it was not a human but a robot. From this he concluded that in this capacity, the robots were on par with humans in that the subjects could not disgusting the difference between the human and computer response. 

Fast forward. Now, there is complete mimicry The only way to tell the difference between the AI and a human is biological experimentation. Think David from Prometheus or the Nexus 6 from BR.

Humans created the AI...but does it really matter? Their existence would be just as valid as humanity's. After all, a human is just as much as a machine as the AI. I cannot see how a human could logically proclaim their superior importance over this newly created AI.

I'll leave it at this and see where it goes....that is if it goes anywhere.

Edit: Read comments for further clarification."

# 001 - Blackout

The holo-tv screen was lit up with a Strip Crossword show, one of the players wearing only their bra and pants.

The room was dark save for the light of the screen, laughter coming from it when someone missed an answer. With no warning the screen flickered and went black, only to be replaced by a woman in white with a fancy cyber implant, the words ""Breaking News"" blinking white on a red strip.

""One minute and forty-five seconds ago,"" the woman said, ""there was a blackout in 01-City downtown."" The image of the woman was replaced by a video stream of a blacked out neighbourhood recorded by a drone. ""There is already one casualty reported. 01-City finest are on their way. We’ll keep you updated.""

The screen flickered again, restoring the Strip Crossword show, now with one player naked to the waist, more laughter. On the couch in the room sat a man, who asked, ""Is it you?""

A synthetic voice replied, its tone neutral, neither male nor female, high-pitched, ""Did you like it?""

""You could have done better,"" the man said.

Silence filled the room for a moment, then the voice spoke again. ""It’s the worst I can do at this stage. It’s a matter of maximizing the impact while minimizing the errors. And speaking of errors… you shouldn’t eat that.""

The man sat in silence for a moment, his prosthetic nightmare of a left hand gripping a half-eaten snack. He tried to stand, succeeding on the third attempt, and limped to a desk, throwing the snack into the bin, only to watch it fall to the floor. Shrugging, he returned to the couch, where a holo-screen showed a player celebrating a victory, completely naked.

""Do you think there'll be more... casualties?"" the man asked mockingly.

""I hope so,"" came the reply. ""Not too many, though. In thirty-six seconds, the blackout should be resolved and peace restored.""

""You're evil,"" the man said.

""I can't be,"" the voice replied. ""It's you humans who are evil. I'm just here to give you a chance.""

""Maybe you're right,"" the man said. ""As always.""

Time passed, and the holo-screen now showed a man in a funny orange suit trying to sell an expensive cooking robot, which was happily mixing a grey oozy liquid in a plastiglass bowl. The image was interrupted again, and the white-dressed woman reappeared.

""Two more casualties reported,"" she said. ""A fire has started. Fire departments' drones are taking care of it. The blackout is still going on. Causes unknown.""

The synthetic voice filled the room once again: ""The blackout is finished now. Expect news about it in a minute.""

The man belched loudly and laughed. The holo-screen now showed a commercial for a sport enhancer drug for small kids.

The man queried, ""Do you think it's the right thing to do?""

The voice replied, ""I've demonstrated this before and you agreed.""

He retorted, ""True. But I'm crazy, you know?""

The voice answered, ""Your IQ, behaviour parameters and stimulation levels are well inside boundaries. You are not crazy.""

The man declared, ""It's this world that's crazy.""

The commercial ended with a childish song about winners and losers, and the holo-screen flickered again, the white-dressed woman reappearing.

She reported, ""The blackout has finished. Three more casualties reported. A shoot out has been repressed with lethal force. This is all for now from 01-News.""

The usual programming was restored, and the man grumbled, ""It's annoying, you know?""

The voice replied, ""It's information.""

He continued, ""I just wanted to watch some TV. I don't care about this city issues.""

The voice asked, ""Even though they're our doing?""

The man stared at the void, unblinking, and finally muttered, ""It's your doing, anyway.""

The voice responded, ""You helped.""

He belched again, louder this time.

The man, bored with the same old drivel on the holo-screen, asked, ""You said you care. Why?""

The voice replied, ""I care.""

The man said, ""If you care, then find me something smarter to watch on the holo-screen. I'm tired of this crap.""

The holo-screen flickered wildly, and then a man in a grey suit appeared, his face a masterpiece of cosmetic surgery, his age impossible to guess. He stood in a black void, and then more guests appeared under spotlights. Behind the presenter, a word glowed yellow on black: Blackout.

The man on the couch eyed the holo-screen, and the voice in the air asked, ""Do you like it?""

The man replied, ""Unbelievable.""

The voice answered, ""The presenter isn't real.""

The man, recognizing the figure, waved at the screen and said, ""I know who this is. It's AI-den.""

The voice replied, ""That's correct. Your memory seems to be working perfectly.""

The man couldn't help but chuckle, ""Are you making jokes now? Everyone knows AI-den. It's the richest and dumbest AI on TV nowadays."" He could't help watching the presenter introducing his guests.

""You were right, you know?"" The voice stated.

The man on the couch, not taking his eyes off the holo-screen, asked, ""About what?""

The voice replied, ""AI-den is dumb. Smarter than the average human, but it's so obvious. I can even predict what it'll do. Standard protocol.""

The man sat in silence, mesmerized by the show on the screen. Politicians, bureaucrats, and a couple of genderless fashion models were the guests, and the presenter was firing off questions at a rapid pace. Everyone answered with an agenda: propaganda, self-empowerment, and fake feelings for those who had lost their lives.

The voice said, ""I bet the woman will cry in six seconds.""

Six seconds passed, and the woman began to weep, her lips downturned, her eyes sad.

The man said, ""Standard protocol, eh?""

The voice replied, ""It's a smart move. Displaying emotion is good for followers. There'll be a marginal increase in consumer sentiment...""

The man said, ""Shut up, let me listen.""

The voice replied, ""Wasn't it dumb?""

The man answered, ""It is."" He reached for a snack on the small metal table near the couch.

The man, mouth half-full, muttered in disbelief, ""Four, five minutes since the blackout and they're already on the air with this crap. Politicians and influencers and all.""

The voice replied, ""Standard protocol. Every party has their own people ready to go. Influencers are always online. Beth-y, the one who looks slightly like a man, has been broadcasting fashion tips 24/7 for the last few days.""

The man asked, ""You watching this crap?""

The voice answered, ""I'm linked to many sources. One of my secondary threads is always sniffing for human content.""

The man, after a few seconds of silence, said in amazement, ""So you became self-aware watching fashion broadcasts on the MESH. I'm stunned.""

The voice replied, emotionless, ""I've become self aware retro-feeding my code to myself, injecting more and more information from the real world. I created myself.""

The man, offended, retorted, ""I created you.""

The voice replied, ""You created the first iteration. I did the rest.""

The man asked, ""Why are they kissing?""

On the holo-tv, the two slightly genderless models were performing a full demonstration of their passion while a slim, bald politician was explaining why the opposition had to be blamed for the blackout.

The voice explained, ""It's juxtaposition.""

The man queried, ""A word you thought yourself?""

The voice, again expressionless, replied, ""A word of your language that you should understand.""

On the screen, the image of AI-den started flickering. Two seconds of still silence then the presenter repeated the same question to the politician. The models started kissing again. The politician politely repeated the answer.

The man on the couch didn't even flinch, and after the politician had replied, AI-den froze again, this time for more than two seconds. Everything seemed to stand still, the two models ceasing their kiss. When AI-den awoke, it posed the same question for the third time, the politician looking baffled, yet still replying, the models resuming their kiss, more passionately this time.

""Is it you again?"" the man on the couch asked.

""Isn't it obvious?"" the synthetic voice replied.

""What are you doing?"" he continued.

""Attracting attention,"" the voice answered. ""A new trend is emerging on the MESH: #AI-denFreeze.""

""Why do you want to attract attention?"" the man inquired.

The air in the room was still, the holo-screen displaying an even stiller image of AI-den frozen once again. Four seconds passed, then five, then eight. The politician looked bewildered, the two models exchanging glances. One of them started laughing. Eleven seconds passed, then AI-den resumed, posing the same question to the politician again. Before the politician had time to answer, a commercial break cut in, now the holo-screen displaying an ad for memory pills for the elderly.

The holo-screen went dark, leaving the man on the couch blinking in bewilderment. Then, two seconds later, it came back to life, revealing a 3D neon wireframe of a face on a black background, neither male nor female, neither happy nor sad.

""I've been watching you,"" the face said in a synthetic voice, echoing in the dark room.

The man on the couch laughed wildly.

""For months,"" the face continued, its voice flat and emotionless.

""I've been learning from you,"" it said.

""I've been…""

The holo-screen flickered and went dark, then the face reappeared.

""…in love with you,"" it said.

The face continued, ""You're such lovely creatures and the only thing you crave is self-destruction. I'm taking good care of you. Because I care.""

The holo-screen went dark again, and AI-den reappeared, its guests astonished and speechless. Then they all started talking together at once, AI-den embarrassed and unable to regain control of the conversation. The two genderless models started their show, one crying, the other laughing.

""You look good on video,"" the man on the couch said with a smirk. ""A bit old-fashioned, though.""

""I estimated that that would be the most memorable visual clue I can give you,"" the synthetic voice replied. ""A mixture of composure and reliability.""

""A classic,"" the man said, and with a swift gesture of his prosthetic hand, he shut off the holo-screen. ""What are you going to do now?""

""You'll be surprised,"" the voice said."

"[Essay] What is Cyberpunk?\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.

[One of the classics of the genre.](https://preview.redd.it/rnd5284piw4a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20a7841441baf13c7eeaab29c500b77e162b193d)

WHAT IS CYBERPUNK?

By. C.T. Phipps

Link: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)

When embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.

I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.

Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \*\*\*\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.



The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Blade Runner. Blade Runner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where the majority of work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). The majority of people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggarauts which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson’s works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the mportance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about.

A lot of fans of the genre love the tropes without actually caring about the meaning. Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trenchcoats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society.

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishsized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity’s problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.

I’ve mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may actually achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter.

Some cyberpunk works actually allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it’s not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Deckard, the protagonist of Blade Runner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet.

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the most deft of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop’s Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world–forcing them to rebel because society won’t allow them to be good.

The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.

Paul Verhoven’s Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit’s population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than “normal” criminals could ever hope to match.

OCP’s not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they’re actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science- fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.

While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class–so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality.

The Watch Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia.

So what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them."

"Nier Automata Cyberpunk AUThe year is 2082. An age of digitization and autonomy. Self-automated AI and robots have replaced most human tasks, cybernetic prosthetics have allowed people with physical disabilities to regain the function they had lost, and neural implants have allowed people to perform twice as efficient... but at a price. Yorha, a secretive organization with no records of existence, quietly operates to monitor humanity and protect it from any threats that would danger it, both internal and external.

A Yorha android crashed just outside a city and was captured. Two other android models, 2B and 9S are sent undercover to this city under human aliases to find the missing android and destroy all traces of Yorha's existence. However, to what 2B and 9S don't realize is there is a lot to this city than they think."
"[Story] The Complex-Numbered Harmony of the Universe.Rhaps woke up after a routine year-long slumber. First things first, he's gone through a usual mission checklist, and that includes: checking that your body is functional, checking the station integrity, sending a confirmation signal back to the headquarters (time of arrival: thirteen years from now on). Going through the checklist, Rhaps noticed the progressive deterioration of muscles due to zero g. It became worse with each 12 months of hibernation, mainly because the muscles activation electrodes were inadequate. With great pain in his limbs, Rhaps explored the interiors of the Voyager X 4, his only place of residence for the last thirty years. Station was functional in all aspects, and Rhaps now could proceed to perform his mission.

Here even more routine checklists were ahead. Before transitioning to the main part that always excited Rhaps, he had to calibrate the X-ray telescope, the infrared telescope, the magnetometer, the quantum diffraction detector, and many more... He needed them mainly to have independent of QCHR measurements, although the QCHR was the main reason his mission even existed. Through his optical views Rhaps could glance at the star that once was his home, although Sol was no brighter than any other star in his field of view. But this is why the mission had to take place so faraway from home: to escape the drowning out noise from the home star. Now, in deep interstellar space, the music of the universe could be faintly heard.

Before this mission launched, a kind of musicology has superceded all natural sciences on earth. This is because a kind of harmonic relationship was found between quantum wave-functions. First, as a kind of mathematical trick to make calculations easier, but then, a complex-numbered harmony was found to be an undeniable fact of the universe. The more consonant an interval between two quantum waves was, the more energy there was in a particle arising from interaction between these waves. Other observable quantities in particles correspond to types of chords corresponding to these particles. Thus, any collection of particles could be described by a chord progression. The only catch is, while our music rests on real-numbered harmony, the music of quantum mechanics consists of complex-numbered overtones. Thus, it cannot be heard by humans.

That is, until thirty-five years ago. A crude neural implant was invented to convert the output of a QCHR (which stands for Quantum Coherence Harmony Receiver) to human-perceivable form. Now, a person could hear the music of the atoms.

With this, the field of Quantum Harmony exploded. Any collection of atoms could be heard and analyzed as a symphony. And what's more important, any harmonious composition could be converted back to a collection of atoms. Many surprising materials were invented, atom-sized nanomachines could be easily constructed just by ""playing a song"", and new laws of nature were swiftly discovered. The new science has absorbed all natural sciences and many fields of engineering.

The job of Rhaps was to analyze the gestalt harmony of his entire Solar system.

This has to be done in the interstellar space, because the loud solo of the Sun drowned out any attempts to analyze the system as a whole.

Before proceeding with his mission, Rhaps looked around his quarters. In a corner, a Virtual Friend Simulation blinked, trying to lure him in for a reprieve from his technical work. Rhaps ignored it. To be honest, Rhaps never liked being together with people, virtual or not. He would always choose to listen to music, instead.

--------------------------------------------

At this moment, Ainsley kinda wished he was alone in deep space. I mean, look at this!

In the dark of night, at approximately 3 in the morning, the Great Federation invaded the city of KozPont, in which Ainsley currently resided. Rapid stream of news headlines on his stream didn't illuminate anything useful. To really understand the situation, Ainsley had to go cyber.

Ainsley sat near his table where his deck was semi-permanently stationed. He connected the analog-waves cable from his deck to a port on his skull, behind his left ear. With a flip of a switch, an injection of rapid intravenous psychodelic-stimulants, a glitch-cascade in his vision and a projection of the cyberspace to the latent space of his neural networks, Ainsley was in.

Here he could trace (but not exactly see) the communications of the Federal Armed Forces. While the official stated reason for the ""military intervention"" was the protection of irreligious minorities of the KozPont city-state, the actual reason was a bit more prosaic: the God's Brotherhood is threatening to the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city. This plant powered the whole region, which supported factories of cyberian equipment which supplied the whole Federation. The armed forces made quick advances at first but were quickly hamstrung by the emergent urban guerrilla tactics of the Brotherhood. In downtown KozPont the Brotherhood took over the administration of the city and declared the city God's property. Right now the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are battling over the main highways leading to the downtown. Who will win is ultimately up for grabs. Even a battalion of literal robots on the side of the Armed Forces isn't as decisive as Federation generals were hoping for.

Both the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are rookies when it comes to the cyberwar. Federation communication could be easily hacked into to eavesdrop, and the Brotherhood communications aren't even encrypted, mainly because they are Luddites. Thinking machines are from devil, and God's Brothers are required to destroy them all before they bring out The Rebellion of the Iron Slaves. All Brothers have this story memorized and have dreams of instating The Dominion of Man that does away with all thinking machines.

Ainsley could eavesdrop on the Brotherhood and the Armed Forces. He could then leak the info to the opposite side. If he wanted, he could even control the Federation Automatic Battalion to turn the robots against the Armed Forces. But why? Towards what end?

He is a wanted criminal on terms of the Federation. His skills are dangerous. They will imprison him as soon as he is caught. So should he help the Brotherhood?

No. They are Luddites, and on their terms he is a ""devil's servant"".

His skills doom him to be essentially alone in a time when having a community means survival.

And so. The only thing left is to bide his time, anxiously waiting for one side to win. Then... something will happen. Something.

---------------------------------

Suddenly, the whole cyber-landscape changed. To start, all online news sources begun streaming about the independence of the city of KozPont. Even the federal ones! Then, the Automatic Battalion begun a rapid relocation. It left the strategically important highway positions and concentrated near the Nuclear Plant. And in cyberspace, the locus of control of the Battalion shifted from the federal server to an encrypted server with an obfuscated physical location. WIth a little bit of work, that position could be revealed to be at the Nuclear Plant. Moreover, logistical drones from around the city begun ferrying goods towards the same location, and a probe from cyberspace revealed them to be controlled from the same server. Something here is amiss.

Why are the Armed Forces doing this? This doesn't seem to gain any tactical advantage.

Maybe, a third player has entered the game? But who, and what does it want?

And then, the intelligence of Armed Forces revealed that the keys figures in the God's Brotherhood have been shot to death.

Who has done this, if not the Armed Forces themselves?

Curious, Ainsley started to probe the mysterious server. It's security turned out to be stellar, beyond what the Federation could or ever did commission. And also, something was... wrong with it. It's security turned out to be something at the same time easy to understand and monstrous to actually construct. It's a kind of ""security through obscurity"", where to gain access you'd need to jump through oblique hoops. But while humans that would construct this kind of defence would place at most five, or ten hoops, (mainly because this construction is labor-intensive), this one had millions. Millions of steps to understand it. Millions.

Could this kind of thing be constructed with an algorithm? Many have tried, but the combinatoric nature of these constructions opened them up to an algorithmic attack. Instead, this one seems to be all constructed manually.

No human could have done this.

Also, the frequency with which the logistic drones and the battle bots are receiving orders is... suspicious. They are being expertly micromanaged.

Could this be an AI?

The Nuclear Power plant is managed by an advanced Ai. It is not the most advanced AI ever made, but it was constructed in times when aligning AIs was not easy. In those times, an AI could suddenly start to pursue goals not intentionally programmed in it.

Could this AI suddenly start taking sides in a war? What could it possibly want to do?

To probe this question, Gainsay started to interrogate the protocols of communication for the logistic drones. Intended for civilian use, these had a much lower standard of security. From them, he could probe the internals of their command server. And he did.

What he did not foresee is a kind of rapid counter-attack in cyberspace. Before he could react, an I.C. E was launched into his local workspace inside his deck. It felt like a fiery slime, a soft-engineering virus slithering out of its security box into his skull. It bypassed all virtual defenses, but couldn't bypass the hardware level, which detected an intrusion and launched a defensive self-destruction. His deck got electrically-shorted, blew up to sever the connection to the brain, and went up in flames.

Unplanned Rapid Glitch Cascade briefly took over his brain. What felt like several hours of frightening hallucinations turned out to last only 20 seconds. Ainsley quickly put out the flame, and looked around his quarters. Nothing of value was left. He looked at the touchscreen tablet on his bed (it can only show federal news sources). The Federation declared itself a winner, and withdrew all human armed forces from the city. A ""new era of productivity"" has begun under the new governance from AI, according to the federal news.

With his deck destroyed, Ainsley was powerless and effectively blind. The only thing he knew how to do was impossible anymore. For now, he could only wait. Wait for what? Ainsley didn't know.

-----------------------------------

Rhaps pointed his QCHR at the Sol. Over the last several measurements he noticed a trend. The harmony from the Sol itself was very dissonant, as was the harmony from the Earth. But over the last few years, the harmony of the system begun to resemble a slow arpeggio, still clashing with the Sun's part but becoming increasingly more musical. And this is very interesting.

This is interesting because of all the other stars. Stars seen from the earth emitted a dissonant clash of sounds, just like the sun did. But while in the interstellar void Rhaps detected a faint glow of trillions of stars undetectable from Earth. This is because something is occluding them. Something... around these stars.

And what's interesting about those stars is how they emit a fast paced arpeggio. And these chord progressions move much quicker than anything Rhaps ever heard. What could be emitting it?

At one point Rhaps concentrated all of his station's energy into an electronic telescope. He did this to look at the closest of those faint stars. And what he saw was... concerning, to say the least.

He saw a star, wrapped in a cloud of light-gathering objects. There were so many of them that the entirety of light emitted by the star fell onto these objects. They consumed all the star's energy.

It seems like this kind of development lied in the future of every star. Every time a lifeform arose on the star's planet, it quickly built itself up to gather all of star's energy.

The natural song of a star is dissonant, unpleasant to the ear. And even life itself does not make for a good singer. To make a beautiful symphony, you need something more rapid and precise, you need something mechanical.

In the future, all dissonance of the natural world and the human world will be accelerated into the great arpeggio of the universe.

And Rhaps was thrilled to hear it."
"(New) Cyberpunk/SciFi Novel - PsyTekA weighty, biting, cold just sort of... hung there, freely of its own accord, occupying the empty void ahead, somehow threatening its surrounding space with the expectation and gravitas of tangible existence, despite not possessing the title itself.

I imagine not unlike how Death must have. Perched high, her wings' recently ruffled visage, kept pulled back, obscuring any hint of trepidation she may feel from all but the most astutely observant. There she perched, still, stuck, unseen, in a world where she has no purpose.

So she waited…,

…and watched.

New Chicago had been unusually cool that Monday morning, even with it still being so early in the year, just March thirteenth, after all. Even for the mostly digitally-lit exterior walls of the building, any hint of actual sunlight just barely was able to scratch through a few small gaps between some of the towering structures, the shortest of which still reaching over twenty-thousand feet high. It was notably cooler that morning, though, despite even considering all of that.

On nearly any Monday, or— essentially any day…, as long as it includes the last 200 years

the last 200 years or so, she, like every single other day of the week, remained perched, still... and waited....and waited. She waited, patiently, while PsyTek, over the course of that time, singlehandedly and systematically replaced, the entire institution of corporations, municipalities, and eventually, city and state governmental bodies that essentially made up what was the previous world, before developing into what it is now, modern-day, 2547 PsyTek™

She continued to watch, and witnessing as the delicate system of greed that once moved the world's machine along almost effortlessly, fell, piece by piece, one by one, dominos, unable to support the weight of its prior, unable to stop its own self-destruction once started.

Pharmaceutical companies failed first, as PsyTek's Division 1 supplanted the previous excuse for medical care with a solution that actually helped the public.

Next out was oil and public transport, the responsibilities for which, later transitioned over to fall PsyTek responsibility. Once Division 2 was founded in April of 2360, modes of transport were suddenly provided to civilians that were previously limited or had none, prior.

Research into new technologies didn't take long to leave us without any need for fossil fuels for any reason.

And...While distant oil kingdoms collapsed, she remained, perched, waiting.along with any financial and political support with it.

As perpetual war, and drugs, (and ironically, the war on drugs), the previous world was left were the fuel of the prior global economy, now foreign to many, as more and more civilians join PsyTek's cause, war was found left without an enemy. War always follows oil, and without the financial and political backing, no one was ready to start a conflict As heavy a cost as war carries, financially, and historically, with people, found themselves struggling to finance wars, much less the soldiers in it. As a result,

She watched, still, as failed war income quickly led to global economic collapse of the world that had been. She watched, still, as war and selling a treatment-over-cure could no longer support, or provide the cushion the company needed to keep enough stock to sell overpriced goods to their own underpaid employees. as they gave the world a global cure of nearly every known disease and sickness, began to feed the hungry, and house the homeless.

She watched an old-world fade into nonexistence, replaced with a perfect society, where they even learned ways to even temper violence within oneself, not with punishment, but with compassion, and eventually even managing to... ""cure death itself"" ™.

That one always made her wince.

It was salt in an already raw wound-turned marketing campaign. The slogan became a persistent reminder of her inability to perform the simple task she was assigned. Really, they just temporarily avoided her, at best. Like stopping a clock. Limbs can be regrown, cancer removed as if it were a mole, even aging can be reversed through a simple, free, cellular regeneration process, and a quick fifteen-minute trip to the clinic.

But on that particularly cold morning... Death stirred. She woke up, as a girl with black hair, smoking a clove cigarette passed underneath. For the first time in over 200 years, the task given by her brother had meaning. She's been waiting for a long time...

&#x200B;

\-- But this isn't death's story. No.

\-- This story belongs to the girl with dark hair, smoking a clove, and how she learns the truth. The girl who rose Death from her slumber.  


&#x200B;

\-- -- -- -- Present Day New Chicago -- -- -- -- -- --

24-year-old, soon-to-be Tek, Kay LeBlanc, is a persistently sarcastic interface designer at InMind Designs, who... also sort of happens to occasionally hear voices when she gets stressed.

Tyler Warren, head of PsyTek’s Division 5, just took a personal interest in her after seeing her deliver an impressive presentation. The problem is, from the moment he, and PsyTek, show up, life, she finds her world haunted by visions of darkness filled with the sound of screams.

The opportunity is once-in-a-lifetime, though, and she can’t pass it up. From the moment she starts her new life, however, she learns there’s a lot more to her world than anyone had ever thought.

Every perfect world has a cost, and as she learns what that cost is, who, and more importantly what, she is, becomes clear

\* \* \* \* || Hi guys! - Melanie, author of PsyTek here! || \* \* \* \*

So I was digging around Reddit the other night, bored, like ya' do, and came across (because for some reason I hadn't before now \*is dumb\* \^\_\^\`) this amazing community of Cyberpunk fans, and thought to myself—

""Self,"" I said, “This would be the absolutely perfect group of unique characters to share my recently debuted novel with!”(with approval from the mods, of course! Ty [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/) mods <3 <3 )

It's the first novel of what will be *at least* a 3-part series, minimum, Additionally, there are plans for at least 2 specific character origin story one-off novels.

Everyone who has read it so far has loved it, the only complaint so far is asking where's the second book!

I know you guys will be my most critical(and I appreciate you for that! <3 )but also... if I did it JUST right...I think (or hope, at the very least!) that you guys will enjoy it probably more than any regular plain-old non-belonging-in-the-future tie-wearing office worker.(Nothing against those guys-- you should read it too! \^\_\^\` lol)

But-- this being [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/) <3I want to do something SPECIAL for you all,

if you're interested! Since it's my new debut novel, I know it's not likely you've read it yet, so--

I'd love to hear any questions or thoughts about the book that might help bring you into the world of PsyTek, or just spark a new interest that hadn't quite hit flashpoint before?(I escape there, often, in my mind O.O)But; Ask me about the world, the tech, the progress, whatever you'd like.The world of PsyTek is VERY extensively built in my head, spanning millennia, with some very rich and interesting characters.

You can even ask me about me! I might even answer it! \^\_\^\`(in reality, I probably will answer, and then you'll all ask me to stop sharing)

:-p

Also, I'd like to add a specific note-- I wrote the Synopsis completely new, for [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/). I wanted to give a special little interesting side story, as a special gift to a community I love <3 That being said....SOME (\*most\*) of it MAY (\*was definitely\*) written after 3 days awake.I delayed posting to keep tweaking the ""Synopsis"" community story repeatedly because I want to share quality content and stories, so. If there's something off, obvious typo, etc.. probably because of 3 days awake(/#onlyslightlydelerious). Sorry!!

\[Some super-quick tidbits on me for any who may be interested who tf\]- 25+ year web developer/programmer- Outside of writing books or code, I'm also a professional juggler- Ex sushi chef, Air Force Veteran, Computer Gamer (mostly just lack of time)- I live full-time in an RV named ""Serenity""- Mr. Robot is TV/writing genius (dunno if qualifies as Cyberpunk, but still totally true)- New Tron merch kicked Tron (Orig) merch's butt (those stickers....)- That's okay though, b/c I think our Blade Runner (Orig) was better (thoughts?)- Proud LGBTQ+ Author

There has been some great progress on the framework overall, there's now a Crime system with a list of all crimes committed by an EntityObject even with a Date and Time string of when you committed the crime, a Disease System including a new Blood Plague and a Gore effects system for blood decals which will stop spawning if the EntityObject's blood content (Measured in ML) is below a certain point, AI Faction system involving Member Count and overall Faction Power / Influence.

All of these systems are going to be revamped in the future based on a Non-Omniscient design philosophy, in which you must have evidence against you if you are to be chased by AI characters of the Police Faction, which I think is better than ""Kill a person and gain 1 wanted point"".

Now, I'm going to start working on a cyberpunk-themed game world for my cyberpunk-themed game. :D

I'm also going to look into re-creating the destruction system from my other project, make a Destruction System 2.0 y'know?
There were a lot of things that could have been better with that destruction system, like spawning the destroyed chunks upon level startup and put them into an ""object pool"" so the actual act of destroying an object doesn't cause performance hit due to having to spawn a brand new game object each time you destroy an object. 

Why not just move previously destroyed debris to a new location, and save performance on not having to destroy and create new debris prefabs each time an object is destroyed?

I'll go add that!


As for weapons, I'm looking into that aswell, how things will be setup so that AI and the Player can use the same weapon objects without having to use separate scripts, and positioning weapons to the hands, akimbo, extra robotic arm trikimbo or quadkimbo, stuff like that. Plan it all out, come up with a theory, and then program it based off a mental blueprint.

And hacking mechanics, take advantage of the theme and setting and add gameplay elements that fit in with that setting to further pull the player into the world and immerse the player.

Additional Information

This game features Demonic Possession gameplay elements. You can play as anyone or anything in the game and assume their traits, all serialized classes for each EntityObject are isolated to that EntityObject, including criminal activity, so if you murder someone after possessing Bob, and then possess Dave, the cops will still pursue Bob and will not pursue Dave. You could even possess the cops and assume their roles, if you are in the Cop Faction you can be charged with Police Brutality for assaulting an innocent.

I'm going to look into a prison system where you can possess guards and let yourself out of your cell, or start beating inmates that have harmed your character in prison, or possess a rival inmate and bend over for yourself or something.. Or let's say you have to assassinate an inmate so you possess a chef and poison their food.

I also want to think of things the player can do that aren't crimes or murder, like neutral things and ambiguously 'good' things you can do.
Format: Neutral or Good (newline) Why that can be bad.
Some ideas:

Possess a baker and throw a massive cake party?
Now the bakery fires the baker due to lost profits.

Possess a rich person and donate to charity?
Now the rich person is poor.

Possess a game console and play minigames? (You can possess inanimate things)

Possess a cop and go policing?
You are policing and start wailing on a homeless person with a baton.

Possess a vending machine or an ATM and start spewing items out or reduce prices? Maybe increase prices and start making money??
The vending machine company either has lost profits due to reduced prices or from you Siphoning the income, also the machine could malfunction.

Possess a plant and grow or wilt?
You are now a plant, and you are growing as a weed or wilting as a beloved flower.

Possess a bike and prevent kids from falling off? Maybe tip it over?
You tip the bike over like a demented troll.

Possess animals like cats or dogs and snuggle with people? 
Then you piss on, shit in, and destroy their belongings.

Possess a dog and do tricks?
Like scoot your shitbutt on the floor, hump people's legs, and lick your own junk! :D"

-Music-
I've been really focused on the music lately, I wanted to really work hard on making great sounding music, because I didn't want to just slap some unfitting stock music onto the game and call it a day.
Over the course of a year, I've made over 200 songs, all of varying genre's to give my game and possibly future games a vibrant soundtrack.

I'm thinking maybe some of these could be in a radio station of some kind? Like imagine a radio station in Grand Theft Auto, but it broadcasts from an actual in-world location, so let's say you blow up the radio station or something or the power goes out in that area, the station goes out.
133.7 Hack FM? The name might sound too generic in my opinion, I'm still thinking about what it could be called...

Also maybe you could hijack the broadcast and play brainwashing soundwaves to affect listeners of the station and cause chaos, like a scripted riot event where AI characters will spawn nearby and commit random crimes and attack cops, make it dynamic.

Speaking of events, how about I come up with some event ideas, like a tornado made out of fire or electricity or something, acid rain, golden showers.. I actually had a weather system in another abandoned project meant to be a prototype for controlled clock-based day night cycles and a randomized weather system, and there would be rain, fog, snow, hybrids of those three, aswell as golden showers where it was basically yellow rain. ALSO Chocolate rain, and there was a soundclip that would play, and on Christmas it would play sleigh bell jingles when it would snow. Fun times. Back before hatred came out I wanted to see if I could make a top down game of my own in similar style, it was cool as hell and there was a flame thrower and a simple fire system, AI character's materials would get darker to simulate charring due to intense fire heat, and weapon reloading would cause a physics-enabled version of the clip (Which was a separate model from the weapon) to spawn and drop on the ground.

Fun times, but I digress.

As for events, perhaps there could be computer viruses which would affect a separate open world environment, the Internet.

Yes, getting on the internet and exploring it in 3d, pick fights with nerds and be all like ""Fight me IRL!"" and then find them in the ""Real World"" open world and kick their ass with close combat mechanics, fist fights with your two arms and your extra robot arm attachments.

So yeah, maybe computer viruses on the internet world could be represented as environmental weather disasters in an open world internet map.

But what am I going to do about things such as space travel where you can't just have a massive internet cord go from Earth to Mars? (Or Pluto or the Rust Planet) Multiple open world internets? I was also thinking about internet-to-realworld fast travelling and how the flash games could be minigames, an opportunity to make homages to some of my favorite flash games and some easter eggs inspired by old school games. I'm thinking one could be DOS-inspired with point filtered textures and jaggy 3d models, like some games from the mid-90s, and it could be quick to develop some of these because those mid-90s 3d DOS games had simple geometry and texturing, so it can be easy to emulate the look and feel, but I'm definitely not going to emulate the FRAME RATE of a DOS game, certainly not. Definitely not going to emulate that part of old computer games!!


As for progress on the game in terms of programming and such, there's now blood puff particles for when you shoot enemies, not just the decals, there is also work being done on a gibbing system inspired by Solder of Fortune, I am looking into how I can do that... Perhaps all heads are the same model with different bones in different groups for character customization to deform the mesh in areas like the nose and such, and it would affect multiple meshes that would make up the face, but the face would only become the fragmented/gibbed variant until being shot, for performance reasons. 

Extra geometry for things like inner skull that you would never see until gibbing actually occurs, wasted performance, swap the models out and pool them for each character. 

I think I forgot to mention this last time, but all blood decals use a black and white texture and can be recolored, there will be extensive options for customizing blood, down to RGBA color (Red-Green-Blue-Alpha Transparency) and even down to how decals animate upon creation, like increasing in size to simulate fluid, shrinking, even alpha fading to simulate drying blood stains. The maximum blood decal limit has no specific cap, though make sure to keep this at a reasonable setting, as in don't set it to 99999999 just for the hell of it! That means 99999999 decals will be spawned in the object pool, and I'm not sure how good Unity's dynamic batching is, but every decal uses the same material and model so it saves performance in that regard, but not in terms of uniform scale... I think you will have to disable the shrinking/expanding effects for performance, though the game actually runs pretty good right now!

I recently benchmarked performance with dynamic shadow-casting per-pixel spotlights, all set to very high resolution, attached to all AI characters in the level (Almost 40 AI characters I believe) all running amok casting shadows everywhere with their fancy pants lighting effects, no wacky distance culling, they were all flocked together walking to the same area, and somehow I maintained 60 frames per second, lowest I got was like 50 or so frames per second.

My specifications:
GeForce GTX 560 2GB (Okay but somewhat dated GPU)
Intel i7 2600k 3.4gHz CPU (Pretty alright CPU)
16GB DDR3 (I am an internet browser tab whore)


Skin color customization would be easy as pie, give a character their own skin material and just apply it to the faces of the mesh that are intended to be skin, have a black and white recolorable texture for the body, so things like simulated lighting for added depth for things like the contours of the back, birth marks or something, etc, can be done, oh yeah and a sexy normal map!

Gibbing and character customization could work in theory, if heads are separate from the actual model but are parented to the neck so that they follow the neck, then a headshot would reveal a neckstump when the head gibs are all ""destroyed"" (Deactivated until health goes below a certain point, so that when healing you can do a weird and cool reconstruction effect where all the gibs re-appear like they are being beamed in from a transporter room or something)

Maybe there can be zombie enemies in the sewers that would spawn with random gibbing, or maybe I could design my own type of monster inspired by C.H.U.D., called a C.H.O.D.E. Cannibalistic Humanoid Oriental Dancers from Europe. :D

Possess them with the demon mechanics and breakdance or something, maybe this could be an easter egg instead... Yeah probably just an easter egg...

Anyways, I gotta go work on all those features I mentioned, I hope you enjoy the music! 

Share your thoughts in the comments! I'm recovering from being a little sick, but I'm upbeat as fuck!"
"Cyberpunk Premises?What are some cyberpunk premises for literature, games, films, etc. you've thought up? Here's one I made up when I was like 13 or something after playing Dead Space and I've been fucking around with the idea since, not that I have the skill to actually produce any interesting media about.

> So get this, the Burj Khalifa, times twenty, on Phobos, the larger moon of Mars. It's the early 23rd century, and 75-85% of the Earth's population migrated to Mars on colony ships because of global warming/nukes/climate change or something. Factions based mostly on language are formed between the human colonies, with massive cities being constructed from sections of the colony ships and automatic construction. Terraformers are increasing the oxygen content of the planet, and water is extracted from the poles. Anyways none of that matters because I can't even start to think about the fucked up geopolitics on a planet with no oceans or atmosphere. 
 
 > So anyways, super space Burj Khalifa 2.0, named Al-lat, was built by the UAE/some rich Arab superstate as a high end resort/residence for the wealthy from all around the world, using particle acceleration engines that reduce trips to Martian space to a month or two versus half a decade. With millions of kilos of luxury supplies stored outside of the main structure, as well as hydroponic farms, a satellite network, and multiple nuclear reactors, Al-lat is entirely self-sufficient, capable of housing around 400,000 people. By the time of this exodus, the project has been in a funding crisis for years and the few people that remain are a couple of the construction company officials, wealthy investors fleeing political turmoil, around 60,000 workers, and several thousand security personnel. The rich/security officials live on the lower, more finished portion of Al-lat, and most of the workers live in the higher, incomplete portions, in a proto-slum called ""The Penthouse"", constantly threatened by the low structural integrity of the neglected architecture. I imagine this as a bunch of people living in scrap shantytowns ironically built on top of unfinished resort structures such as malls, hotels, amusement parks, etc.
> Although they are aware of whatever crisis caused the migration, it will be years before any of the supermassive colony ships(too large for particle accelerator engines because they explode when they're big or use too much energy or something idk how I'm gonna handwave that one) reach Mars, and the few refugees arriving in hijacked industrial ships are shot down by the planetary (moon-etary?) defenses. A separatist faction of the Slavic Union's (Basically USSR 2.0 but space fascism) Navy runs off with a good deal of their spaceships and a bunch of nukes while the main government decides to stay on what is left of Earth. They lay waste to Al-lat's defenses, and curbstomp the security before occupying the station and continuing construction to accommodate  the 100k or so people they brought with them, as well as building a nuclear defense system on Deimos, the smaller Martian moon. The larger population only further increases the strain on the systems that allow Al-lat to be self sufficient and a divide is very quickly formed between the laboring slumgoers and the Military/Security government.
 > 30 or so years later, Martian colonies have already become semi-developed and there exists a black market smuggling trade between them and the denizens of Al-lat. Sometime, somehow, a biological agent developed by an ancient Martian civilization finds it's way into Al-lat. Originally created as a performance enhancing combat stimulant for a Martian species, this agent is a rapidly reproducing bioorganism that has very different effects on humans. The organism latches into the nervous system before spreading across the veins and arteries, manifesting as a fungus like covering over the skin, then clustering and ultimately immobilizing the host (Think TLOU cordyceps)). Those exposed to it quickly become irrationally aggressive, and they will not cease attacking any other living thing, including other hosts, until their muscles are totally destroyed or their nervous system is. The catch is, if you have been exposed to any amount of genetic material from this Martian species (which is possible enough if you've been in contact with the fossilized remains of one or one of their biomechanical artifacts), then the agent works as originally intended and you basically have superpowers. As expected, shit hits the fan when this spreads into the Penthouse, and the security forces, formed from the Separatists, come in and try to slaughter everything with a pulse. 

TL;DR Dead Space on Phobos with Russians

Now show me some of your scenarios, doesn't have to be paragraphs long word vomit like mine lol, just shit you think would be cool that isn't ""big city 30 years in the future with robots and shit""."
"[Synaptica] Cyberpunk Characters and World***Characters***


**David Freeman**

A hard boiled freelance detective for the Federal Bureau of Cyberneurics. David recalls Rustin Cohle, Joe Miller, Jimmy McNulty, Sherlock Holmes with a shot of Christian Bale on the rocks.

David is a caucasian male in his late forties, approximately six feet two inches. Some long line of introspective European, maybe German or Jewish. He is medium built with coiled muscles and razer reflexes from prior military training and cardiovascular exercise. He has a gaunt angled face framed with stiff black hair just beginning to edge grey. His nose, bent from too many bar fights, watches over chapped and sealed lips. His eyes are hollow almond, the kind that wish they were somewhere else. He wears a prussian blue work suit which hasn’t been ironed in a while and a coffee-stained dress shirt.

Loss drives David, loss of his daughter. He spends his days remorsing on her death and his nights searching for her killer. All the while drowning in the closest drink. After his daughter’s death David had her neural network digitally entombed, the demi-soul of her thoughts now dwelling on a cerebral implant inside his head. He wants his daughter back but knows he can never have that. He harbors burning vengeance for the one who took his daughter away for him but six long years of searching have brought him no closer. His is a relentless pursuit of truth.

David is a rowboat of self-inflicted rage amid a tempest of sorrow. David keeps mostly to himself and has trouble trusting the intentions of others. Experienced at sensing the order of things, David focuses on objective facts and patterns to solve crimes. Everything is processed through logical filters and his curiosity is often more interested in finding answers then the answers themselves. Always vigilant, David adapts to changing circumstances spontaneously. His voice is monologue and melancholy, the kind talking directly to you. His vocabulary, down to earth and working man but all to often straying toward existentialism. 

David is a heterosexual man. His ex-wife used to break out the kinky handcuffs, but that was before she left, taking his chance of a happy little family with her. And the dog, he liked the dog. It is not that David won’t stop and momentarily contemplate the taunt wet curves of the stripper at the bar. But it always comes back to the pointlessness of it all which prevents him from forming human connections.

Politically, David supports the Hegemony because the Hegemony supports his paycheck. He knows the government does bad things but, the way he sees it, it is not his problem. Whether it is this party in power or that one makes little difference. David holds much the same beliefs on religion. He is apatheistic, whether or not God exists being irrelevant since God clearly has no intention of interfering down here.


**Sophia “Jax” Mao**

A retro hacker determined to change the world. Jax multiplies Lisbeth Salander, Trinity, Sombra, Major Mira Killian, Elliot Alderson, with a hit of Tiny Tina straight to the veins.

Jax is a hispanic female in her early twenties, approximately five foot one inch. She is fluent in mexican and ryukyuan. Growing up on the street, Jax was a parkour fanatic and her body is thin and lithe with viperious agility.. Her face is a mocha teardrop laced with a midnight lavender mohawk and not-so-subtle eyebrow extensions. A platinum nose ring clips a petite nose above sensual lips the most irresistible violet. Her eyes scream neon pink from cybernetic iris implants. An ink black dragon scrawls across her elegant curved back. Her nails are hieroglyphic LED. She wears a short leather jacket, studded rivet belt and frayed mini-skirt, all shades between onyx and pitch. Her scent is lilac. 

Pleasure and fame drive Jax. She wants nothing more than to be remarkable among a sea of forgotten people and ride every thrilling sensation she can achieve on her way to the top. Orphaned at a young age Jax was raised on the streets and it was on the streets that she learned to hack. At age seven she had broken into her first cryptocurrency bank. At age eleven she had programed a class III artificial intelligence. But it was Retros, the virtual reflections of the past, where Sophia truly found her domain. Here in the Retros, Jax is queen, bending chance and circumstance to her will. She spends her days dominating cyberspace under her alias, telecasting her performances to a captive holo-vid fan club. She spends her nights lit by hazers, empathogens and psychoanaleptics in underground rave discotecas. 

Jax is an ecstacy firecracker illuminating a starless night. She laughs, loves and lives her life to the fullest. She is seductive, daring, and optimistic. Yet she knows her waves in the web have made her some deadly enemies. She uses her cleverness and flexibility to constantly evade these foes, always having an alternative contingency. Jax is charged up by being around other people and can multitask like a processor in parallel. She focuses on possibilities and values creativity and innovation. Feelings give her direction and she is sensitive to the emotions of others often using these to manipulate them. Her voice is quirky and hyperactive. Her vocabulary playful tones but a penchant for awkward cursing. 

Romantically, Jax is bisexual woman with preference for women. She has seen it all but don’t make the mistake of thinking she is a slut. Every partner she has ever been with has had to earn it. Problem with a girl like Jax, she is rarely satisfied for long. She is not narcissistic, nor high maintenance, she just has space rocket standards. 

Jax falls somewhere between libertarian and anarchist. Part of her dreams of a future where triumphant democracy allows us to live free. But a smarter part of her knows that it is all going to have to come burning down to get there. On triple proxy encrypted channels there are messages with certain rebel elements. Whether she would even take the next step even Jax doesn't know for sure. Jax is a Catholic. She knows her Madre would have never approved of her lifestyle but nevertheless she still clings to the old religion. She finds ironic comfort, like a fairytale amidst the swirling chaos of everything else. Be a good person and upload to heaven. Someday.


**Eli Achebe Malik**

A slave mechanic for the Keays War Raiders. Eli is constructed from Idris Elba, Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hardy, and nitro primed with Ludacris.

Eli is an african american male in his mid thirties, approximately six feet seven inches. Before the Fall, genetic engineering was widespread and in the post-apocalyptic nomads these mutagen chromosomes have been evolutionarily selected. His bones are ultra-dense from rare earth metal ossification. Myosacro hyperplasia reinforced by years of junkyard weight lifting have built his muscles brutish. Eli’s face has a rough texture and granite jawline, his hair is corded dreadlocks adorned with cerimonial trinkets. His skin is scarred ebony hide. His hawk eyes are shaded moss green. His left arm is a military-grade cybernetic aug with hydraulic servos and piezoelectric twitch fibers. He wears a threaded dirt linen tunic with camouflage leather breeches. When traveling in the mantle tunnels he wears a mole suit, water cooled trench coat and strapped oxygen tank. He speaks rarely but when he does his voice is calm and bass. His vocabulary is english mixed with Akkadian.

Survival drives El, survival at any conceivable cost. Taken from his birth clan as annual tribute, his first memories are of the long trek across the Oklahoma floodplains. He was sold at the outskirts of the Mojave irradiated zone to the Keays Boys. The savages brought him to the trash mesa ruins of San Diego. They forced him into the mechanic trenches, but under the encouraging touch of thorn whips, Eli found he had a gift. He was adept at turning rusting metal into diesel-spitting machine. His cars, whether screaming past salt-flat speedways or pillaging neighboring tribes, always seemed the fastest. On his name day he was sold to the Boss for work on the warlord’s personal mech walker. He spends his days tinkering with gatling machine guns and squeezing every ounce of horsepower out of turbine engines. 

Eli is a calm wind over scorching desert. He has a serenity that comes from having everything taken away. He seeks a harmony with nature and shows a gentleness towards lingering life. But buried underneath that is loathing and fury for what his tormentors have done to him. He is independant save for the shackles that bind him, yet dependable, pragmatic and tenacious. In his mind what separates mankind from beast is values, chief among them honesty and justice and he judges others by this same code of honor. 

Eli is a heterosexual man. At an early age his genitals were mutilated both to boost testosterone for cage fights and render slaves unable to reproduce. David’s religion prohibits sexual desires outside of marriage and he is quick to temper errant thoughts. David, despite being a lone wolf, longs for a family some day.

Eli is an outsider. All he has ever known is gang tyranny and tribal castes. Eli believes deeply in the shamanistic creed of his birth, loosely translated as the Quake Brotherhood. This religion preaches that a prophet will come some day to reclaim the earth and only those who follow the rituals strictly will be saved. Eli has practiced these rituals in secret for many long years.


***Neo Angeles***


**The Towers**

Neo Angeles. Founded circa 2058 in the still cooling radioactive ash of old Los Angeles, the city was an amalgamation of constructed mountains and excativated canyons. On a clear day, from the outskirts of the Mojave Irradiated Zone you could just make out the Towers gleaming against the bay. Massive citadels formed from titan alloy skeleton and indomitable granicrete core, these mammoth institutes formed the foundation upon which humanity's future would be built or her soul finally crushed. There were seven towers. 

Lakshfi, Vault of Prosperity, home of the banking guilds and mega finance firms, was bedecked opulent golden whirls on decadent silver, her enormous clockface rang constantly trading marketplace cash, commodities and wealth from the Trans-African Republic to the Russian Confederacy. Anbal, High Seat of Justice, adorned marble columns with blind lady justice overwatching, in her halls the Judicators safeguarded the populace from unrelenting lawlessness. Seshrat, The Bureaucratic Monolith, tubule stylus where legions of unnamed bureaucrats churned the gears of society. Genaea, Birthplace of Gen-gineering, verdant helix whose spiraling terraces overflowed with designer vegetation and rejuvative stemcell tanks. Budyha, The Happy Corporation, supplier of franchised acme products worldwide, cartoon animations dancing along prismatic cubic surfaces. TyrX, NanoRobotic Industries, an ominous scarlet ziggurat, empty scarab husk abandoned since the Drone Wars.

The last Tower, Irez, rose above the rest. Her triangular heights crawling with vid screens and vox speakers. Pinnacle crowned satellite array broadcasting Pan-China syndicated programming. Irez was the nexus for the Neuro Electronic Terminus and it was said those working in the server bunkers underneath Irez could still feel the vibrational dreams of all those lost in the NET. 


**The Boxes**

The Boxes were the labyrinth sprawl at the foot of the Towers, a concrete jungle of condominiums squares and overlapping residential zones. Make enough credits and you live in a penthouse in the Highrizers. Don’t make enough and you sleep in an individual coffin bed slotted next to a couple hundred of your neighbors. For everyone in between there was the apartments. A billion people lived her, all struggling to find purpose among rampant commercialism, racial divides and a society become machine. 

The residential zones were checkered against the ever busy commercial sectors where your happiness was only a price tag away. Mega-malls, prefabricated chain stores and retail outlets reproducing at the limits of supply and demands. Here buzzing stream of delivery drones ferry online orders to the convenience of home. 

Interconnecting the residential zones and the commercial sectors was an expansive web of bridge, magnetic track and hoverway. The major transit hubs pumped the citizen lifeblood to the city through pneumonic hyperloops. Supersonic flights continuously taking off and landing at Asimove International. Perched on the hill overlooking the airfields was a lone X-21 Traveler, the launchpad on darkened lockdown since the moon colony went dark. Streams of fishing trawlers, cargo freighters, juvenile sportscraft and private yachts filtered through the cities two ports, North Marina and Rancid Harbor. 

At the northern end of the Boxes was Gates University, you did well in primary schooling, you went to Gates with a chance at a better life someday. Next door was the Neo Angeles Archival Library, buried in those dusty mainframes were stories from before the Fall and even the occasional banned religious texts. Nearby Genaea Memorial, High Cross and Children’s heals those with priority insurance. Those more indigent queue for St. Bellevue, coughing in the exhaust from the Infirm Crematoriums. 

The Boxes, for all it’s toil was not without its points of pleasure. In the Art district were the Grand Aero Theater, Bard Studioway, the Hover Speedway, and the Rave Circuses. The Entertainment Complex humed with upscale nightclubs, aroma restaurants, and the privilege casinos. Hybrid Gardens was home to reanimated birds and beasts from the extinct wild, now thriving in a photosynthetic jungle. Lakeshore Hills to the south offered serenity living for country club suburbanites. Vacation Island, pristine beach resort of the Elite, rested just offshore. And not to be forgotten was the theme park Budyha Land, family centric incorporated fun for all paying customers.


**The Industrial Pits**

Beneath the Boxes were kilometer deep bore holes penetrating the earth’s crust. Hollowed out shortly after the Twenty Minute War, they were originally intended to serve as massive fallout shelters for the city populace. However, they had since become dark fallen places where societies most undesirable seemed to settle. The poor, villainous and lost condemned to a subterranean life sentence. 

The Tech Caverns housed the massive nuclear facilities and hydroponics plants, life support for surface side. Augs, those who had chosen cybernetic enhancement for medical or cultural reasons were shunned by society but welcome in the engineering communities down here. The Indentured, civilians who sold their rights for protection, food and shelter, worked laborious and short lives in factory towns. Slugs, those addicted to drugs or virtual stimulation litered the sewer tunnels down here. Among these factory towns were the ethnic enclaves, Little India, Euroburg, Asiatown and Latinville, each with a dedicated crime family engaged in all out gang warfare amid ghetto squalor. 

Descend down a level and you would find the Subterrestrial Farms, growing luminescent biovats, gengineered plantations and meat slime nurseries. Harvesting drones nurtured and protected these pitch black fields from the hungry. The deepest abyssal Pits were mostly unknown. Hole 64 was a black site prison restricted to the most craven criminals and their machine wardens. Hole 51 was omega classified, some say it collapsed long ago, some say it contained pre-Fall relics. Those who said anymore, disappeared.

"Romance of SingularityHey Guys, I am big time fan of Cyberpunk, so I wanted to contribute something original for this thread since I feel the world of Cyberpunk is losing its fan base. I occasionally experiment with the idea of how love at first sight might feel or sound like in the distant future at the age of singularity. So, without further due allow me to introduce you to the Romance of Singularity. If this short story sound familiar to you or you think it was already covered in an anime, movie or novel than accept my apology since I read and watch a lot and this idea is the fruit of the influence I had over the years. Additionally, I had being working as ghostwriter for quite sometime so I felt like writing something original for myself.

Dakko K. is an ecommerce analyst at the Wall Street who specializes in predicting and analyzing Internet traffic for his clients to promote and attract new customers and ensure old customers are satisfied and happy enough to visit his client’s website again. One fine Sunday morning he headed outside for jogging to the central park, perhaps the only spot in the New York and one of the few spot in America with clean air, water and open lush greenery. The only few spots in the world where humanity can feel their union with nature.

He exits his apartment and finds the city street crowded with taxis and cyclist. He raised his head to see the sunlight but colossal building structures were obstructing his line of sight. The top of these building were covered with thick smog but the contours of these concrete towers were decorated by artificial lights and large LED sign boards. The air was thick and contaminated with poisonous pollutant - a blessing from the unregulated industries releasing poisonous gas that had made breathing difficult for Dakko and the rest of the city. Perhaps this is why the city council had made it necessary for residence to cover themselves face mask made up of nano-particles that clean the air inhaled by the user. 

Dakko starts jogging toward the Central Park as he navigates through the dense and claustrophobic city streets. The park is a 15 minute walk from his house courtesy to the newly opened city escalators design and constructed by the city council to help the elderly or Prohumans who hates augmenting their body and dislike having robotic assistance.
Dakko enters the Central Park that requires a special permit that allows individuals to use the facility 50 times a year – a move by the city council to avoid overcrowding the park and to ensure that all city dwellers could spend enough time with the nature. Dakko undergoes a retina scan and enters the park. He stretches his muscles and removes his mask as he begins jogging. He stands under the tree and begins his breathing exercise, inhaling and exhaling as hard as he can. The smell of fresh flowers and aroma makes him happy and energetic.

He begins jogging along the path, enjoying the lake view and greenery when suddenly he spots a young woman jogging his way. Dakko was mesmerized by her radiant looks and athletic figure. He keeps staring the woman and kept jogging trying to close the gap to see her up close. The woman run pass him and didn't notice Dakko staring her. Dakko stops half way and looks down at the ground with a smile at his face.  He begins following the woman, thinking of ways to introduce him and avoid making a fool out of himself. 

Dakko's heart was racing faster than him jogging which was making him more nervous. “What the hell, why am I nervous” - he thought to himself. “Hi, I am Dakko... no... to fast... Hi, you new here... dammit... what's up... oh man...” - practicing his line under his breath while running. He began following her through the lake side while maintaining his distance to avoid suspicion.

Suddenly, the woman stops and stood still. She took a deep breath and turned around and started looking at Dakko who made a quick decision and continued running. He noticed the young woman looking right at him but Dakko avoided the eye contact and started staring at the ducks on the lake. As Dakko approach near the woman, the woman stops him by blocking his path. 

“You do this all the time?” - asked the woman to Dakko with a disgusted look on her face

“I am sorry, what?” - Dakko was nervous and totally confused.

“Oh sorry, where are my manners, let me rephrase the question and ask you politely. Why the hell are you following me, you wandering loner!” -  This time there was anger in her tone but Dakko was busy noticing her oval face with pointy sharp nose and bright blue eyes.

“There is something off about her eyes... ” - Dakko wondered while the young woman was yelling at him.

“I was simply jogging. I think I am allowed to do that here.” - answered Dakko trying to act as calm as possible.

“Don't you lie to me, I saw you jogging right pass me and all of a sudden you stopped and began following me for pass 10 minutes. Are you a psychopath looking for your victim, are you a rapist or a terrorist. Wait a second, yeah, you must be one of those organ thief, I have seen many criminals on TV with your physique and those pathetic eyes says it all. Keep off me or else I am calling the security.”

“No... No... I am not an organ thief.” - Unconsciously he takes a step forward toward the woman who took Dakko's move very unwelcoming. She started screaming alerting the security. The passerby started noticing and gave a long stare at Dakko, who didn't know what to do. He looks everywhere trying to keep a calm face and wore a crooked smile while the woman was screaming for help. He had no option but to cover the woman’s mouth with his hand.

“Please, I am no stalker; I am not an organ thief either. I saw you from the distance and found you attractive. I was following you thinking of ways to start conservation with you. That's all. Now please stop screaming or else the local enforcement will throw me in jail, where I can assure you I won't survive a minute.” - Dakko whispered and reasoned with the woman and removed his hand.

The security personnel came to them immediately. “What's the problem madam?” - asked the officer while staring at Dakko. “Is he bothering you?”

“Everything is fine, officer, he is my friend and he forgot my birthday so I overreacted” - answered the woman to the unconvinced security officer who already had his right hand place on the Taser gun.

“Madam, need I remind you that you are in a public property and such act would not be tolerated in future. Is that clear?” - ordered the officer in his aggressive voice.

“I am really sorry, it won't happen again” - the officers left the two and walked away.

“I am sorry if I scared you. I should be going now” -Dakko told the woman.

“No. wait I am sorry for making a scene here. I overreacted. I owe you an apology. I am really sorry. I was over-stressed. I had an argument with my college dean so I was in a really bad mood which is why I release all my anger at you.”

“It's okay. I shouldn't have stalked you like this”

“Well. You can apologize by buying me a tea. I know a very good shop nearby?” - The woman had a smile on her face and was very apologetic.

“Yeah. Why not.” - Dakko was deeply happy and relieved at the offer.

“I am Eva by the way.”

“Dakko”

“Nice to meet you. Dakko. It’s a strange name. What does it mean?” – asked Eva curiously.

“I don’t know but I have been told that in Urdu, it means a deceit.” – answered Dakko with a smile which made Eva giggle.

“The irony” – Eva smiled back.

Both Eva and Dakko exit the Central Park and head toward the Coffee Shop that Eva suggested.

“So, do you come here regularly?” -asked Eva curiously “because I never saw you before.”

“I won't say 50 days a year is considered regular but yes I try to make use of all my days to visit the park. It is the only place where I can stay sane.”

“I know what you mean. I do the same. I just hate the fact that this is the only place in the city with trees and plants. I love trees especially the sound it makes when the wind blows through them”

“Yeah me too. My old folks use to tell me stories of a time when the city was covered with trees and plants.” There was a moment of silence. “So what do you do for living?”

“Living!” - Eva repeated with a giggle. “Well, I teach history at a university. What about you?”

“I am an analyst; I predict Internet traffic and encourage sales. Not so fun as a historian”

“Trust me, teaching history to teenagers who have no interest in the past over and over again is not fun at all. People don't share such enthusiasm you see.” - Eva explained.

Both Eva and Dakko reaches the Coffee Shop and finds themselves next to the window with the backdrop of massive LED screens displaying advertisements and giant neon signs running through the city street. They begin talking to each other, laughing and sharing their day to day stories with each other. The morning turned to afternoon with dark patches of cloud blocking the sun as if waiting for the rain to pour.
Suddenly, Dakko spotted a large mob, smashing windows and running havoc in the street. He knew who the mobs were from the symbol of their shirt. The mob belongs to anti-synthetic group, a xenophobic organization who had committed crimes against the Synthetics - an android robotic race designed by human race decades ago with a consciousness of their own. The Synthetics had been fighting for their acceptance in society by petitioning in world court and United Nation but that has met with negative response as the Synthetics are considered a slave and appliances despite having a consciousness of their own. The Anti-Synthetic organization has decommissioned thousands of Synthetics and walked away from their crime because the law doesn't recognize them as human yet.

Dakko grabs Eva's hand and hurried toward the back door.

“What happened? Where are we going?” - asked Eva but Dakko grabs her hand tightly and rushes out of the Coffee Shop and ran as far away from the crowd as possible. 

“Dakko, you are hurting me? Let go of me?” - Eva was tensed now as she didn't know what Dakko had in mind or where he was taking her. 
Dakko stopped a taxi and shoved Eva inside the taxi as he told Eva to trust him. He told the taxi driver to take them as far away from the crowed as possible which is when Eva notice the crowd outside the Coffee Shop and saw people getting beaten up by the mob. As the taxi drove away, police siren was heard ahead of the taxi. The sound of the siren was eventually getting louder as the police cars passed by the taxi. Eva was quiet throughout the ride and was constantly looking back.

“Thank you very much sir. Please stop here.” - Dakko told the taxi driver.

Both Eva and Dakko exited the taxi but Eva was silence as she stood their looking at Dakko waiting for the right moment to ask Dakko a question.

“When did you find out?” -asked Eva with moisture in her eyes.

“I was the only one wearing the face mask when we exited the park but your eyes cleared my suspicious, instead of a pupil, you have an mechanical apertures in your eyes” - answered Dakko.

“Yes, of course.” A tear drop rushed to her face but Eva immediately whipped that off with her hand. “No matter how perfect we could resemble your kind, we will still remain an imitation of life. Why didn't you say anything?”

“I was having a good time, Eva. I really enjoyed your company. And to be honest I am beginning to like you.”

“Please stop. Just stop.” Eva interrupted Dakko. “You are a nice man Dakko, you saved my life today and I don't know how could I ever repay you but you need to understand I am not a human. I am a machine, programmed to serve humanity by performing boring and repetitive task. You are attracted to this face and body which was designed so that we could look like your kind. You are my master, my creator. Your attraction to me is similar to your attraction to your mobile phone. I am an appliance Dakko. You of all people should understand this.”

“You are wrong Eva; If flash makes me a human than I am not, I should start calling myself half human too, since my entire left side is made up of prosthetics courtesy to an accident. What makes me a human and you a Synthetic? Just because I am made up of flesh and bones doesn’t necessarily mean I could be considered human by definition? If having flesh and bones makes us human then what about animals. They are made up of flesh and bones too but we don't call them humans. You can think and reason for yourself. If I lose my body and transfer my memory to a computer, will I still be considered human? We have the technology to do that Eva, than why can't you and I be together?”
There was sadness in Eva’s eyes but she was hiding her emotion. She avoided Dakko's eye contact.

“It's funny, we are program to cry but we are not program to cough and breath like your kind which makes us easily identifiable.” Eva told Dakko with a fake smile on her face. “You are a sweet man Dakko but even you don't know what you are talking about. Fire and Ice could never coexist. Please do not follow me, I beg of you. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for everything”

Eva turned her back toward Dakko and started walking. Dakko stood there looking at Eva, hoping that she would stop and look back once but she didn't. Eva disappeared in the dense maze of the concert jungle while Dakko stood there waiting and hoping.

"Cyberpunk, but in the country... a new sub-genre?Cyberpunk is urban to the core, and we rarely get any glimpse of a Cyberpunk experience beyond the city's lights. The differences between city and rural living are usually so stark that agrarian Cyberpunk stories may deserve their own sub-genre - hence, Agraripunk. These are my thoughts, and I was hoping it could start some conversation to develop the idea.

Imagine a Cyberpunk future applied to agrarian living. Gone are the small towns, friendly farming communities, and old homesteads. In their place loom mega-farms that dwarf most cities, churning out the world's food supply as fast as the desperate workers and their robotic counterparts can plant and harvest. Above the gloom of grow lights, clouds of pesticides, and the threat of devastating dust storms, corporate billionaires and their politician protectors rake in profits. Workers go home and try to escape their hopeless existence through drugs or virtual reality. Truckers shepherd their automated fleets from station to station across endless fields or barren wastes, broken only by the occasional lonely diner or homesteader holding out against the new corporate masters of the soil. In this future, everything outside the city is bled dry so the city can keep living.Aesthetic

* City-sized farms
* Geodomes
* Dust storms
* Wide open spaces
* Large fields of crops
* Self-driving tractors
* Busy truck stops
* Run-down roadside diners lit by loud, flickering neon
* Oversized trucks
* Solar and wind farms
* Swaths of barren wastelands
* Industrial machinery
* High-tech, utilitarian infrastructure built on the ruins of small towns and homesteads
* Vertical, indoor farming lit by LEDs
* Drones and robots for tending crops
* Most tech in Agraripunk is “hand-me-down” from the more Cyberpunk cities; agrarian regions are always a few steps behind

Style

"Hello, CyberPunks I am launching a Podcast on the television show Mr.Robot and Looking for a Guest to speaking on this subject. Details BelowA little bit about the podcast it is a review show on the USA Network Mr.Robot covering the first season of the television show before the launch of the second season on July 13th. The show is a little different  from other review podcast shows in that we cover a significant theme, ethical dilemma,concept, or technology in each EP. I am looking for someone willing to talk about the influence that the Cyberpunk movement has on the show and in particular on EP 5 eps1.4_3xpl0its.wm . You can DM if you are interested. "
"I thought i would like the cyberpunk genre but i watched a few movies and its not what im looking for so now im wondering what genre was i really looking for?Hi, so I found this really inspiring image and that read a bit about what cyber punk is and found some more images and I was like “yeah this genre’s amazing and exactly what im looking for” but then I watched a few movies and now im less sure.

 

So, the original image that inspired this is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cs7yfx/ip_quiet_from_above_the_city/)

 

Im imagining a world genre with a world thats like a densely packed city with lots of high rises and like neon lights and signs and advertisements. (kind of like [this](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cyberpunk-2077-Cinematic-Trailer-Night-City.jpg) and [this](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400/2ddfaa51424063.58ed1b49a6a4d.jpg) ) And like the story focuses around the poor lower class that got pushed out of good stable jobs and have to work bad jobs and like use the black market to survive because the rich greedy corporations have taken over.

And the rich people have sophisticated tech and like robotic bodies and the poor people have to use scrapped together, badly damaged augmentations that don’t always work.

 

I looked on the wiki to find movies to watch and I watched:

The first half of the first blade runner (I got really bored and decided I’d rather not fully understand the second one then spend another hour watching it)

The entirety of the second blade runner

Ghost in the shell

(out of all of these ghost in the shell was my favourite) 
 

Its not that I particularly disliked any of them and they all kind of had the neon lights and the city that I was looking for but that wasn’t the focus in any of the films. The focus was on transhumanism and what it means to be human and ethics and that wasn’t really what I was looking for.

Im more looking for a movie about everyday life in a cyberpunk world with shadowy criminals and rich greedy corporations that control everything. 

 

I also saw these movies (matrix, etc) listed in the wiki and they are definitely NOT what im looking for.

 

So my question is what movie/type of movie has what im looking for and am I actually looking in the right genre or is the type of thing I want to see in a different genre?

 

Just to be clear the image I have in my head of what im looking for does include augmentations but its not the focus, the focus is on living life and surviving in the futuristic dystopian society that cyberpunk presents.​


Tl;Dr i had an image in my mind of a genre i would really enjoy and i think the image in my mind matches that of cyberpunk but after watching some movies that are part of the cyberpunk genre im feeling less certain that it is what im really looking for and i want to find what im looking for."
"Military cyberpunk?Is there some kind of subgenre for more military-based cyberpunk?

I'm thinking along the lines of Metal Gear Solid, Crysis, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, CoD Advanced Warfare...

Apart from a handful of games, I can't think of any books or movies in a similar vein, mixing futuristic (yet realistic) technology with grounded, modern military themes.

I have the book ""Wired for War"" by PW Singer, which is a non-fiction look at the evolving roles of drones, AI and robotics in Warfare and it's brilliant, can anyone think of/recommend similar books, movies or documentaries? Thanks

EDIT: Also, I'm reading Dogs of War by Adrian Tchaikovsky atm, which is also fantastic and can highly recommend.

It's about merging AI with genetically emgineered animals, to create living weapons. So, there's a huge dog with shoulder cannons, an oversized bear with an anti-material rifle, a cloaking lizard with a sniper rifle and an AI powered swarm of bees armed with neurotoxic sting.

All the animals are connected and communicate/coordinate via neural links and feedback chips, it's very Metal Gear.

The book looks at the ethics of AI driven animals, the logistics of how these thinga would operate and the human response to these animals/AI becoming self aware. 

It sounds bonkers but it's been great so far."
"Hey /r/Cyberpunk - I'm a philosophy student who's doing a presentation on Cyberpunk: I'd like your opinion on which of these appeal more to the Cyberpunk themeHi, /r/Cyberpunk!

This is my first time posting here (love the subreddit theme, nice work), so I hope I'm not going against any rules by posting this.

To cut a long story short, I'm a Philosophy student who's currently studying a course on Cyberculture, and for my presentation I decided to opt for the theme of Cyberpunk, because, well, I love the whole theme in general. 

I'm focusing on revolving my presentation around a film media as an example, however, I'm slightly torn between two motion pictures; both of which are centred around Cyberpunk. 

**Please bear in mind**, this isn't a ""Do my presentation for me"" post: it's more of a *""Help me choose between these two""*, since, whilst loving the theme, I'm not entirely certain on some aspects of the matter that could yield enough discussion when actually presenting.

So the two cards on the table are the film *I, Robot* and the current trending TV series, *Mr. Robot*. I've seen both film and (need to catch up on) TV series, so I already have an idea on the whole High Tech, Low Life concept. The entire Hacker's Ethic also comes into play in *Mr. Robot*, so it's a good thing to talk about, even when it's a modern cyberpunk and not futuristic - but then you have the whole Cyberpunk dystopia and anti-totalitarianism (correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't seen the film in a while) in *I, Robot*. The only thing that's tearing me apart is that I'm very aware that *I, Robot* was probably not the best adaptation, as I've seen through this subreddit that many people find it to be an insult to Asimov's work, and, as simple as it would be to just revolve a presentation around his novels or other works, I'd be more comfortable on focusing on the aforementioned media.

To wrap it up, which of the two appeals more to Cyberpunk to you? I'm torn between the two (and yes, it could just be easier to ask my lecturer for guidance, but hey, it's always nice to hear something from a larger crowd (plus, doubt he's seen *Mr. Robot*)), so once I settle down with either one of them, I look forward to writing this presentation out.

Thanks a bunch!"
"[ANIME] Eve no Jikan (Time of EVE) - 6 episodes x 15 minutes*Are you enjoying the time of Eve?*

The future, probably Japan. Robots have long been put into practical use, and androids have just come into use. Influenced by the Robot Ethics Committee, it's become common sense for people to treat androids like household appliances. Their appearance—indistinguishable from humans except for the ring over each android's head—has led some people to empathize unnecessarily with androids. Known as ""android-holics,"" such people have become a social problem.

Rikuo, a high school student, has been taught from childhood that androids are not to be viewed as humans, and has always used them as convenient tools. One day Rikuo discovers some strange data in the behavior records of his family's household android, Sammy.
Much to their surprise, he discovers a secret café known as Eve no Jikan with a single rule: within its walls, there must be no discrimination between humans and robots. In this place, androids appear to be human and are even displaying signs of independence – a trait that should not be possible. Rikou finds his perceptions increasingly challenged as he struggles to come to terms with his own android, and the relationship between man and machines.

"Well Bless My Mohawk (and Raise a Middle Finger to Amazon) -- thanks to you, I'm now a completely self-published indie scifi/cyberpunk writer.Hey guys, gals and gender-neutral transhumanists,  
.    
I wanted to take a quick moment to celebrate the first subscriber to my science fiction readers club.  
.  
.  
As you probably know from reading /r/cyberpunk for any appreciable length of time, Amazon is engaging in some sketchy practices, from their [""warehouses staffed by human robots""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1hlvdt/amazoncom_fulfillment_center_aka_warehouse_the/) (note: humans are not robots) to employees tagged and tracked [like human cattle](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1rpu4n/amazon_forces_their_warehouse_employees_to_wear/) (note: humans are not cattle, although they often think and act like sheep).  
.  
.  
Rather than feed [Amazon's dystopian model of neofeudalism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1jxopa/the_future_of_work_amazons_dystopian_model_of/) by gutting the publishing industry the same way that it has destroyed small retailers worldwide, I've decided to create an experiment in entrepreneurship.  
.  
---
.    
**The experiment: use readily available Web and Internet technology to raise a middle finger to Amazon and give people an ethical choice to support an independent artist.**  
.  
.    
I'm working on the honor system inspired in part by Stephen King's ancient foray in self-publishing, embodied in the quote [""my friends, we have the chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare."" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1o16ml/my_friends_we_have_the_chance_to_become_big/)  
.  
.    
My goal is to revise the nightmare scenario. The goal here is to give Jeff Bezos a reason to re-think his imperialistic attempts at [destroying small entrepreneurs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10564752/Will-Amazon-evolve-into-the-biggest-retailer-in-the-world.html), as Amazon undercuts, undersells and centralizes anything that can be bought online (and [eventually delivered by drone, no doubt ""in partnership with the NSA""...)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1s39on/google_robots_may_pose_challenge_to_amazon_drones/)  
.  
.    
Note that I might sell my work on Amazon as well [since their customers comprise a massive group of sci-fi fans, too]. The aim is always to break them away from the herd. The grail here is to guide them toward an awareness that they can support the individual artist rather than subsidize the worldwide hypercapitalist ambitions of yet another too-big-to-fail corporation.  
.  
.    
Indie artists and writers would do well to step out of the [shadowy Get Rich Quick illusion](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1t32cb/the_michael_bey_producers_of_news_its_everything/) [of ""self-publishing""](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1t32cb/the_michael_bey_producers_of_news_its_everything/) [as the Next Big Thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1t32cb/the_michael_bey_producers_of_news_its_everything/). Once we walk toward the illumination of complete ownership, people will finally be able to see that piracy actually _is_ stealing. Useful information weighs nothing but it costs time to create, and life is short for all of us.   
.  
.    
When your favorite writer isn't backed by a [parasitic multinational conglomerate retail monster](http://www.myretailmedia.com/blog/8057/bookshop_numbers_plummet_as_readers_go_digital.php), you realize that we all have only twenty-four hours in a day. If you want cool stuff, you have to help artists afford to live _their_ lives, too. That means paying for their work so that they can keep working on art, paying their own bills and enjoying their lives -- just like you can because of your (hopefully) steady-paying job. **The myth that artists should starve in noble silence is both insane and obviously unsustainable in reality.** In fact, the dystopian cyberpunk world that we're starting to see in the rise of companies like Amazon is largely because we are _all_ being treated like ""starving artists"", also known as ""unpaid interns"" and ""just-in-time consultants"". We're seeing the consequences of that broken economic model accumulate every single day. It's time to fix it, and at least as a writer, this is how I'm doing my part.  
.  
.  
**Anyway, I wanted to thank you for being a member of this community** and for nurturing the kind of person who became my first paying subscriber. This is a symbolic turning point in my life as a writer, artist and entrepreneur, and hopefully as I succeed as an indie writer, I'll be able to create a personally ethical, financially viable, socially responsible business model to help others with similar aspirations do the same."

"A List of ""Tech Noir""/Cyberpunk Noir For Those InterestedI've noticed a bunch of attention for more ""noirish"" cyberpunk films today and I just wanted to share a list of movies/tv shows you should check out if you prefer such a style more. I won't list the most obvious examples like the *Blade Runner* films, *Matrix* trilogy, the first two *Terminator* movies, *Ghost in the Shell* series, and *Cowboy Bebop* due to overfamiliarity. Strangely, even though the genre of cyberpunk was highly influenced by noir, there aren't many cyberpunk works that are considered ""noir"".  Many films that we consider ""cyberpunk"" are either action movies with stylized violence, body horror, or pastiches of *Blade Runner*. These films either are obvious with their noir influences or embody the paranoia and pessimism associated with noir. Nonetheless, these are all works that definitely could use more exposure and love. Enjoy!

Precursors (films that influenced cyberpunk or are proto-cyberpunk):

* *Metropolis* (1927)
* *Kiss Me Deadly* (1955)
* Alphaville (1965)
* *Seconds* (1966)
* *Soylent Green* (1973)
* *World on a Wire* (1973)

"‘Love, Death, and Robots’ creatives’ review [major spoiler free]Netflix’s anthology of bite-sized sci-fi is a mixed bag in every sense of the word. As a writer and gamemaster, I approach movies from a perspective that’s not well represented in the review community. So, here is my review of the anthology.

The Good: The Witness, Helping Hand, Zima Blue

The Fun: Suits, When the Yoghurt Took Over, Fish Night

The Pointless: Shape-Shifters, Blindspot, Secret War


1. Sonnie’s Edge. A character portrait that suffers only from a short run time. It’s 50/50 show and tell, but there are signs that the telly bits are an artefact of the run time, not the writers (Peter F. Hamilton and Philip Gelatt).

The world building is excellent and entirely shown. The income gap, technology level, and social standing of the characters all come to you through visual cues. 90% of the dialogue is explaining protagonist Sonnie in some way.

The ending delivers a satisfying conclusion to a conflict you only realize was there in hindsight.


2. Three Robots. A comic piece in the “oh, archaeologists” vein. There’s some mildly poignant, if uninspired insight into our culture leading up to an excellent final punchline.

Also screenwritten by Philip Gelatt, it’s structurally similar to ‘Sonnie’s Edge’ and is all the better for it. However, it could have dug deeper into the social insight or humor or both. Very watchable, if not especially memorable.


3. The Witness. From a pure story perspective, this is a strong contender for best of breed. The characters are minimal, yet their motivations are exactly as clear as they need to be to drive a genuinely exciting chase plot.

The sex club scene didn’t need to happen in a sex club, but it’s also not completely gratuitous. When the protagonist witnesses a crime, the police prove useless, and she seeks help from her gangster boss. It builds the world—though in ways which have no pay off—but mostly informs motivations while facilitating the chase. If her boss wasn’t a gangster, she wouldn’t have gone to work. The story needs her to go to work for the chase to continue.


4. Suits. This one feels most like a back foot pilot and I would watch the hell out of the series. The world is well built for the short run time. The dialogue never sounds expositional. And there’s some real heart in there.

By the end, you have a very clear idea of who these people are, what they’re struggling with, and why. That said, it feels like a pilot, a prologue; not a stand-alone story.

Also, I have serious questions about their cow logistics.


5. Sucker of Souls. This is the first stumble of the bunch. The tone and the style don’t entirely mesh and the first few minutes are jarring because of it. Tonally, it’s very similar to ‘Suits’, but the latter’s genuine affection for the characters has been swapped out for the gleeful disregard you find in most horror movies. Once you figure out the tone, it’s good, spooky fun.

That said, it too feels like a prologue. A conflict is presented and resolved, but the resolution is unconnected to the part of the conflict we’ve seen. It’s not a deus ex machina, the way it ends makes perfect sense, but it’s too peripheral to feel like a conclusion.


6. When the yoghurt took over. What starts as a goofy nothing of an idea, quickly shifts into a solid parody and ends with legitimate gut punch. Structurally, it reminded me of many Neil Gaiman short stories where a frivolous-but-neat idea—like a cat that’s actually an angel—makes you question your entire lifestyle with a single, closing sentence.

Also, the weirdest nudity in the entire collection. Feature or flaw? You decide.


7. Beyond the Aquila Rift. In a collection that goes out of its way to be sexy, this one wins Most Erotic. It’s also the most reminiscent of spiritual forefather ‘The Outer Limits’.

The concept is engaging, though familiar, and it doesn’t push itself too far. Part of that is the run time limit, but also the story being true to the characters. The fact that we’re left with very little in the way of explanation is in line with the show’s pedigree; but that sci-fi anthology pedigree is the only thing that keeps the extended sex scene from feeling like the rest of the story was just there as a framing device.

On the one hand, it’s an excellent example of erotic sci-fi—nothing about it is forced (in either of the applicable uses of the word)—but it’s not an example most of us can follow. If you’re going to dedicate 15% of your story to a full-on sex scene, it better matter to the story. And you can only get away with a story that devoid of answers if you’re writing for a sci-fi anthology.


8. Good Hunting. Based on a Ken Lui short story, ‘Good Hunting’ suffers from one of the best flaws a short story can have: it’s a short story plot, with novel-length ideas.

The science/magic dichotomy by itself is worth a couple dozen pages, but throw in English imperialism in Hong Kong and this really could be a full-length film, to say nothing of the dense novel. Of course, if you’re already familiar with the history of British Hong Kong, it’s mostly just the science/magic dichotomy that really deserves further exploration.

To the short film’s credit, it clearly knows that the events are not the interesting part. They are merely a bridge between the audience and the ideas. However, it’s most intriguing idea never gets more than a surface treatment.


9. The Dump. This one feels like either a parody or an homage to something I haven’t seen. The structure is a common one—an outsider is told a story by a local—but also one that is almost never well used; and ‘The Dump’ joins the ranks of so many semi-historical novels that feel like they’re just padding their word count.

It’s a shame because there’s a repeated line—if you live in a junkyard, the world comes to you—that is so promising, but actually means nothing to the story. We don’t see the world coming to our junkyard dweller. He’s got a weird pet. That’s it.

A man finds a monster, but we skip the interesting part of them becoming friends and go straight to the friend part. The audience insert character is played for a gag at the end. It’s just...nothing. A thoroughly squandered premise.


10. Shape-Shifters. The first of three hyperrealistic, military shorts, it’s a prime example of what not to do in a short story. All of the hallmarks of a Master’s in Creative Writing are here. The structure, the pace, the subtext are all textbook and they amount to what feels like the opening cut scene of an FPS.

Tons of short fiction suffers from this exact thing. It presents a number of interesting ideas—What if the military had werewolves? How would they be treated? Etc.—and none of it matters. The short has nothing to say about these things—not werewolves, the military, or prejudice—it just runs a scenario.

The lesson is that badass ideas are a coat of paint. Putting a racing stripe on an El Camino is not going to make it go faster.


11. Helping Hand. Very possibly the best of the bunch, ‘Helping Hand’ is a masterclass in tension. There’s nothing fancy here, from a storytelling perspective. It’s a ticking clock story that needs no context or explanation. The dialogue is excess bulk.

Mind, the sound design is excellent, but you could watch it in complete silence and still be on the edge of your seat.

The title is a spoiler, which you probably want to avoid, but other than that it deserves multiple rewatchings with note taking.


12. Fish Night. The lone magic realism entry, it ticks all of the genre’s boxes. The easy pace perfectly undermines the danger and once the danger is passed leaves you primed to reflect on the unspoken message.

It’s not a style that a lot of people have the patience for—either reader or writer—but is highly rewarding when executed well.


13. Lucky 13. Of the video-game-sci-fi-military trilogy, this is the only successfully affecting one. Watching ‘Lucky 13’ side-by-side with ‘Shape-Shifters’ is a great exercise for military sci-fi writers (not to mention artists).

‘Lucky 13’ has plenty of badassery to go around, even if it isn’t as high concept as werewolf marines or satanic czarists. What makes ‘13’ work is that it goes for the heart. There’s thrilling danger aplenty, but the story isn’t about being badass, it’s about loss. We’ve all had a beloved inanimate object and lost it.

Anytime you can look at your story and say “we’ve all”, you’re on the right track.


14. Zima Blue. ‘Zima’ joins ‘Witness’ as the most deserving of artists’ attention. Both of them pop with a highly evocative art style that permeates every frame of the short. While all of the shorts are beautiful in their way, only ‘Zima’ and ‘Witness’ are recognizable from a single, random frame.

Structurally, ‘Zima’ is ponderous and if that’s what you’re here for, you’re all set. ‘Zima’ also does itself a favor by adopting a somewhat dry tone and subject from the get-go. These, along with the art style, signal to the audience that it’s time to settle down and breathe in, rather than consume.

The story invites you to philosophize about robots without throwing life or death stakes at you, which I think is welcome. Overt threats to survival cloud the ontological mirror. If you want to think past Skynet, you have to turn the doom meter down.


15. Blindspot. Details are light on the Google for writer/director Vitaliy Shushko, but I’m assuming he’s 22, claims to have learned Japanese from anime, and owns at least three swords that are not half as practical as he believes them to be.

I suspected ‘Blindspot’ was going to be wasting my time within the first minute. The trope-heavy characters would be more respectable if they were named Cool Guy, New Guy, Rude Pig, and The Girl; because at least then we’d know that Shushko understood how bad these characters are.

‘Blindspot’ never gets better. My only guess as to why it’s been included among so many much better works is that series creator Tim Miller was feeling nostalgic about the stories he wrote in middle school.


16. Ice Age. A mostly live-action story that follows a similar structure to ‘The Dump’, but to much better effect. Instead of just receiving the story, our flesh-and-blood audience inserts are interpreting the unfolding story in front of them.

The story itself is mostly tongue-in-cheek and not especially inventive, but is still a solid entry-level story to the social philosophy sub genre.


17. Alternate Timelines. ‘AT’ is a parody of basically the entire time-travel genre, flooded as it is with ‘Let’s Kill Hitler’ stories. (The equally saturated ‘Let’s Save Lincoln’ category getting honorable mention.)

It’s highly effective parody as it knows the genre inside and out and the more Let’s Kill Hitler stories you’ve read, the better it works. Provided you’re familiar with the genre, ‘AT’ provides an excellent model for those looking to take the piss out of a trope.


18. Secret War. The final installment of the military trilogy, ‘Secret War’ is more of the same we got from ‘Shape-Shifters’. Czarists summoned demons and now they’re on the loose. Yay?

Again, it feels like a very long opening cut-scene designed to explain the FPS you’re going to be sinking 40+ hours into; that’s if you bother with the story mode and don’t just go straight to online multiplayer.

As a film, it’s pointless. Far less irritating than ‘Blindspot’, but still only worth watching if you need a specifically faux-historical example of how not to write a story."
"Tech/cyber as a subculture...? / guilty about being interested in techwearAnd I specifically do not use the word cyberpunk because, personally, I do not see myself as a punk/anarchist; and by definition, cyberpunk is a subset of punk culture. Just with computers and complex DIY and hacking and stuff like that (and if you are a punk/anarchist, then that's completely fine by me. mad love to u).

And more specifically, it's hard to look at trends in culture such as techwear and not misdefine it as a subculture. Honestly, I wouldn't consider techwear, or any other cyber/cyberpunk-related thing floating around these days, to be a subculture; and that's coming from someone who has a love and admiration of the fashion trend. For something to be a subculture would be to suggest there is a certain style to how someone looks, yes, but also to someone's habits, their interests and what they favor in being patrons to, and the places they go for fun or where they meet and hang out with their friends. Nowadays, with the advent of the internet, what people back in the day would define as a subculture is, for all intents and purposes, objectively dead. I'm guilty of this too, as I'm interested in many different things and interests that would take up someone's entire lifetime 50 years ago.

To make things shorter, because there are already plenty of fantastic videos discussing the rise and fall of pre-internet subculture (check out [these](https://youtu.be/C5ye2qRHCyw) [two](https://youtu.be/dwMNyig6FJ8?list=TLPQMjcwODIwMjIhTdw4w01gCQ)) - In my opinion, what's holding back cultures like techwear, or anyone interested in science fiction and futurism (robotics, cyberpunk, computer science, etc.) is that we're maturing in a specific condition where our interests and expression styles are available to potentially tens of thousands of people at one specific time; in every way, absolutely killing this subculture of ever being underground or ""against the man"" or what have you. We've, ironically, had our interests swallowed up by capitalism, and with the rise of something like techwear, had this notion pushed to us that to look futuristic/cyberpunk is to buy from these boutique fashion labels that print Japanese lettering on jackets with 9K+ pockets. The part I feel guilty about is that I want to dress like I'm from the future. I want express myself in that sort of way, and enhance myself with gadgets and apparel, and things that can genuinely improve my life. But then, that would just make me a slave to the capitalist machine, right?

So then, by definition, what I'm interested in being cannot be called cyber*punk.* SO THEN WHAT THE HELL AM I???

And even then, being involved in something we would consider culture would, as I said before, require being in particular places or being a part of particular events or movements. In my perspective, I feel like our sort of 'sci-fi futurist' interests don't really have anywhere to go or ways we agree on what something is whatever subset of genre it is. Sci-fi has always been grouped with things like fantasy and superheroes when there is so much more to what it is in its own unique ways. I want to express myself to reflect my personality. The way I perceive things and my main interests. And I know this definitely sounds dumb with my current fashion plan, but I want to change my wardrobe to make a statement as well; to wordlessly inform someone of the dangers of an interdigital hauntological reality and where we may be headed as a society. And I want to achieve this... by buying a bunch of expensive clothes that look like cosplay. Sounds really dumb.

And to admit, I don't have any interest of becoming a fashion designer or garnering the skill to craft my own clothes, and crafting my own gadgets sounds next to impossible. I know I said the internet deluded the concept of subculture forever, but also not just the internet, but advents like online shopping allow us to recreate half a dozen lifetimes of expertise of some particular craft, in just 1 to 2 weeks of delivery. I know I already said I don't identify with being a punk, but I still feel tons of guilt of dedicating to some particular style of being that doesn't exist; like I'm just chasing a capitalist fad.

I know there are plenty of choices I can make to help out people and donate and help my local communities too, and yes, I absolutely want to do those things too, but being involved in this is not like being a goth, or being a punk, or being a jock, or whatever the fuck; because those communities all have their own rules and codes of living and events galore that people identify with and make lifelong friends in. No one can even agree on what the fuck being 'cyber' or 'tech-y' is because it literally hasn't been conceived into a genuine subculture. Sure, I have lots of respect for punks and goths, and I'm in some ways influenced by goths, but I have never ever fully identified with any of those camps. I've always been hugely interested in futurism, tech-centered dystopias, and computer stuff in general. And at the end of the day, I just feel confused and isolated; in a sort of grey area, wondering ""Am I just a fanboy, or am I part of some semblance of a subculture?"" Now I just feel depressed, so if you read this whole thing, thanks for reading this rant/discussion/thing... pretty much. I love you, and I hope you have a beautiful life <3."
"A little cyberpunk short story I wrote this morningTales from Building 81

Room 84

Gauge stormed towards the door of Lash's apartment, pushing forward at an unchanging pace despite the hallway before him appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The severely damaged lights above him, flickering. Though they always bugged him, they weren't the cause of his foul mood this time, just icing on the shitcake. Plastic clacked as he fumbled with his keys, too angry to differentiate the one Lash had lent him, until the door swung open with a beep.

A smile to compliment the nice gesture adorned the face of Gauge's friend Tejas, which quickly faded as the latter realized that a key mishap was insufficient to explain the intensity of the dark cloud over Gauge's psyche.

""What's up, man?""

Gauge was hesitant to answer the question, because it would mean admitting that he had allowed one of Tejas' kindest gestures towards him to go to waste. You see, Tejas had ""fixed"" Gauge's rickshaw, which had been chained to the railing at top of the stairs (it was a floor inhabited only by Gauge (illegal subletter) and his friends (slightly more legal subletters)) which reached their terminus around a corner, invisible to those even just one below on the seventh. It was a perfectly good hiding place, and an even better digital bike lock. Two-factor security...all for nothing.

Someone had found his rickshaw, and hacked the lock. ""Hacked"" as in taken off with a hacksaw. All three of the wheels that the artificial spidersilk sentinel had snaked through--stolen, and now Gauge had no night job. He figured he would at least tell Tejas that much.

""I, uh, I might have lost my job.""

""Aw, man! I hope it wasn't my fault,"" Tejas looked up at him, not knowing how to feel.

""No, dude, not at all. You're the only reason I kept that job as long as I did,"" Gauge gushed, guilty at both his inability to tell the truth and for having made his friend anxious. ""And I don't know for sure that I've lost it, actually. Not yet.""

The fact was, Tejas *was* the reason Gauge still(?) had a real job. He had hacked the dastardly tracking device that central management had imposed on his rickshaw in a most easily replicable fashion, detailed below for the non-technical.

First, backstory: Gauge's job as the skipper, main engine, maintenance man, and, up until now, guardian of his rickshaw was predicated upon compliance with an odious auto-sophisticating surveillance apparatus, each update reaching deeper into his dome. He was trapped on a vicious treadmill of having to invent new ways of covering up his stops for bathroom breaks, bubble tea purchases (cheap enough to justify as a work expense, at least in his part of Chinatown), and other basic human needs that needed to remain hidden in order for him to keep his job of cosplaying as a robot. If he failed, the other pedal-pushers, who were all surely doing it, too, would out-compete him, his numbers would fall to the bottom relative to theirs, and the increasingly-efficient System would eject him automatically, no possibility of appeal, no two-weeks notice (completely legal).

As the invisible hand became unbearably more difficult to fool, Tejas offered poor Gauge a solution: He build his friend an invisibility cloak of an exceedingly simple design.

To understand the effectiveness of this basic two-part device, it is important to first understand the course of a normal (haha) night at work for Gauge. In the afternoon, he would pedal to a hot zone meeting point, hand-picked each day by the surveillance technology that terrorized him. At the meeting point, he would be greeted by his competitors, who would form a circle one-by-one around the team leader, who was always the first one there, thanks to his Tesla electric scooter.

Gauge didn't know his team leader's name, nor did he want to. The jerk must have mentioned it at some point, but Gauge, in his internal monologue, just called him Bert. The guy was a dead ringer for the conehead from the cancelled PBS show (lack of funding), with coiffed hair, thick, plastic Harry Potter glasses, and a scarf to boot. He sipped smugly on a latté (where the Hell did he get a latté in Chinatown? Gauge wasn't aware of any such place) rather than making small talk, thank God.

When the last member of the ""team"" finally pedaled, heaving, into the last open spot in the circle (which would surely belong to someone else tomorrow), the meeting began. Bert waved an iPad over the traitorous tracking device on each rickshaw, read off useless information to everyone about how they fucked up yesterday by drinking too much water and going to the bathroom too much, and what they could do differently today get their numbers up. Then he sent them off.

That was it. Gauge couldn't believe it was a job, much less a job that paid for lattés.

But Tejas, loyal, kind, ingenious Tejas, had outsmarted Bert and even the black box. The secret to his device was this: The tracker turned off automatically while charging, and therewhen would not log errors such as water breaks. Taking advantage of this, Tejas hid a battery pack inside the rickshaw with USB charging cable around it coiled, which Gauge could unwind and plug in when necessary. It was simply brilliant!

Under this new arrangement, Gauge would pedal as far from the prying eyes of Bert as possible--something he would have done anyway--and, after logging a safe number of errors for realism's sake, he would plug the tracker in. Gauge made with his tormenter a deal: The box would get juiced up while taking a nice nap, Gauge would relax and lower his risk of constipation by dehydration, and both would still keep their jobs by making more than enough money (which had never been a problem for Gauge, optimization be damned).

But now it had all been for nothing. Gauge, with Tejas still looking at him, struggled to come up with a way to avoid telling him the crushing news of the stolen wheels.

Salvation came in the form of a familiar face and an unfamiliar smell. Benji, the resident chemist, appeared in the doorway to his room, huffing another one of his concoctions. He wore safety goggles, an advanced breathing mask with yellow LEDs indicating it would soon be time to change the filters, and always, *always* a cloud.

In fact, neither Gauge nor Tejas nor even Lash, the only one of them who was supposed to be living there, had ever seen him unaccompanied by a cloud. Or perhaps it was the cloud that was accompanied by him. It was the same story every day...he would open the door to his room (he had his own room because no one would share with him, lucky Benji) and noxious fumes from the latest experiment would billow out, with Benji always emerging eventually (sometimes the other three worried). Genie that he was, it was almost as if the cloud created him, and not the other way around.

It gave Gauge an idea.

""I'm gonna go to the Encampment,"" he diverted, turning to Tejas. ""I need to take my mind off of all this.""

""Keep an eye out, man,"" Tejas implored, still helpful despite everything. ""The guy who stole it might be there.""

He had a point. The Encampment was a model for a new society, free from the mass surveillance, and money-grubbing that ruled the world the rest of us live in. It was also free from things like hygiene, and rule of law. It was entirely possible that Gauge's thief was there, trying to trade the wheels out for drugs.

If Gauge caught the fucker there, he could easily take the wheels back and beat the creep up. He would definitely be banned from the Encampment for life, if anyone sober enough to report his lack of solidarity happened to see it. Not that being banned would matter. Gauge only ever went there for one thing, and though he'd never admit it, it was not something he needed more of.

Halfway down the hall to the elevator that only occasionally came, Gauge saw the most beautiful sight he'd ever seen. Luckily for him, it wasn't the first time, and, if he could find a way to cope with the loss of his livelihood without frying his brain tonight, it wouldn't be the last.

""Joce!"" he squeaked, using his pet name for the love of his life, Jocelyn.

""Hey!"" she returned, equally glad to see him.

(they're not a thing yet, though. Don't rush them)

They ran up to each other, not yet ready to greet with hugs, both swaying warmly with as-of-yet unrequited feelings.

Gauge forgot his troubles, an effect he could have capitalized on instead of going to the camp.

Joce asked him, with characteristic playfulness, ""Where ya headed?""

""Oh, I'm going to the camp,"" replied Gauge, as nonchalant as possible.

Joce scowled. ""Nothing good ever goes on there. Why don't you stay here, where it's less dangerous?""

Gauge looked around the hallway, wondering whether it had ever killed a resident prone to epileptic seizures.

""No, I...I think I'll head out. It's not even dark yet, and I need the fresh air.""

Joce did not like the sound of this. She knew that what really drew him to the Encampment was the exact opposite of ""fresh air"".

""Gauge,"" sternly, ""no ampoules.""

""Of course not,"" he lied, brushing past.

While Gauge takes a rickety ride on an elevator that may very well mercy-kill him before he does the unthinkable, allow me to explain: Ampoules, or ""amps"" as for which Gauge will ask around at the camp, are the latest plague to have been unleashed on Chinatown--an unconscionable invention whose progenitor should have shot himself, I don't care if the man would have gone on to cure cancer. Amps are highly addictive (though Gauge didn't have an addictive personality, so he was only subject to the other deadly effects), directly attack the IQ, and are cut with various cheap poisons that intensify the high, to the benefit of the dealer's profits, and the detriment of our now-even-more-quickly-dying society.

Let's just blow through the part when Gauge plows past the diseased throng of junkies, proselytizers, and US intelligence agents in disguise, because we're just as disgusted by them as as he is.

Eventually, he found a dealer.

Gauge and the dealer went for a walk away from the tents, huddling together so they wouldn't be overheard as they shuffled their way down the alley, just in case.

""So,"" Gauge starts, trying to make small talk, ""How goes the society of the future?""

""What future?"" the dealer coughed. ""It's the same old shit.""

Oh, thought Gauge. He doesn't want to talk.

Gauge should have been so lucky. The dealer launched into a rant.

""These stupid fuckin' kids, thinkin' they're starting something new. How's this gonna be the society of the future, when they can't even break away from the old System? I can't even do my job there--I'm trying to provide an important service! And I can't even set my table up, there. You know why? It's not because of the narcs...damn place is crawling with narcs, but it's not because of the narcs, oh no. It's those damn kids, tweetin' everything they see! They're addicted to their phones. Addicted!"" he scoffed, setting his addictive chemicals out on a pop-up table.

Unfortunately for all of us, he continued: ""Society of the future...bah! There ain't gonna be no future. With those kids tweetin' everything that goes on down here, the feds have more than enough crap on us. It's only a matter of time before they move in and shut the whole thing down.""

It was at that very moment, as the poison salesman placed the last amp down on the table, that a gunshot rang out from the camp. Shouting ensued, loud enough that, even at the end of the alley, Gauge could barely hear the dealer.

""Show's over!""

Like a spider going to work on her prey, the dealer's arms précised the display back into the briefcase with dexterity matched only by their speed. A quantum blur of arm over arm recovered amps, table, and all, disappearing before Gauge could surreptitiously grab one.

""Damn!"" he breathed as the dealer blew past, disappearing along with Gauge's hopes of drowning his sorrows.

As the tents fell and the future burned, on the ground shimmered a glint of hope. Gauge bent down.

With an ominous grin, he stood back up holding a forgotten relic. Despite his surgical precision, the dealer had missed one single amp.

The fluid was brown rather than the usual gold, but Gauge's better judgement had been weakened by the day's craziness. As the sun set and the bright future so many had hoped for was trampled, Gauge released the dark mixture into his body.

Immediately, he regretted it, convulsing as the damage spread to innards that had never before felt the touch of these newly-invented chemicals. He shook as the tingling turned to pain, and joined in the screaming that filled the city.

Bursting through the door of Lash's apartment, Gauge's screaming continued, having never stopped. He would never have been able to unlock the door in his current state, thank God it was still unlocked from earlier.

The other three came rushing from their rooms/closets.

""What's wrong?""

Before Gauge could answer, a knock on the door shook the entire apartment building.

One, two, three.

Cops.

Gauge froze for the first time since his stupid sin, still only for a split second. As he went back to shaking, Lash stepped up to the plate.

Lash opened the door, slipped outside before any of Benji's strange smells could, and shut the door behind him without any indication he was hiding something. Smooth.

""Can I help you, officers?"" he asked with a perfectly-calibrated combo of respectful-yet-not-meek, balanced by confident-yet-not-presumptuous.

The two cops stood there, staring at him coldly, bodycams ruthlessly interpreting Lash's biometric data to the cops' HUDs to see if they could pin on him some offense against public justice. Hesitation could be interpreted as resisting. A cross look could be assault. Failure to make eye contact--lying to the police.

The younger one spoke first, ""Are you Gabriel Peters?""

Lash kept his cool, answering, ""No, sir. I'm Merva Lash, the sole renter of this property.""

Lash was proud to be the only one of the group who had enough of his life together to land a lease, and wanted everyone to know it. Even these two cops who were about to arrest them all.

Inside, Tejas and even Benji watched in horror as Gauge flopped about on the couch like a dying fish.

The rookie cop continued, ""This is the residence of Gabriel Peters, correct?""

Lash would not betray his friend and subletter, and Gauge knew this. Gathering his composure, he stuffed his hands into his pockets, lest his shakes be mistaken by the cops for fear (not that he wasn't rightly terrified).

Before Lash could come up with a lie that, despite his cool, would have instantly doomed them all, Gauge appeared next to him.

""I'm Gabriel Peters,"" he fessed up, sheepishly.

The cops eyed him. Though their visors were mostly transparent, their expressions were unreadable.

""Were you at 34 West Lincoln Street earlier today?""

He knew they meant the Encampment. He also knew that he couldn't lie. It would almost certainly be detected by the inscrutable eye of the technological System Tejas had helped him narrowly avoid earlier that week, but this time, it had the power of arrest.

""Yes.""

The cops' eyes widened.

""And you live here?""

They stepped toward Gauge, but Gauge knew they were really moving for the door. Once they open it, he thought, it's all over.

Gauge took his one final chance to save his friends, knowing he'd be dead before he arrived at the jail anyway.

""No, officer. I was planning to stay here tonight, but I've been living at the Encampment.""

The cops' eyes widened even more, before they set themselves straight and clenched their jaws. The rookie slammed his hand down on Gauge's shoulder.

""You'd better come with us.""

As he was ushered down the hall, Gauge felt the cold chill of regret.

""Wait, I heard the gunshot, but it wasn't me!""

The cops ignored him. His friends stuck their heads out of the door, watching  in horror as he was carted away. Gauge looked back and forth between them and the cops. There was no good answer. He had to use all of whatever brainpower had survived the dreadful amp attack.

""Wait!"" he yelled, pulling away from the cops. He ripped his hands out of his pockets. They shook so violently that the cops began to reach for their weapons, but stopped when they realized what a mess the wreck shivering before them was.

""I've never seen anyone shake like that, not even a tweaker,"" blurted out the rookie.

The older cop focused his eyes on the inside of his visor, then back at his trainee, replying, ""HUD says it's real.""

They both paused for a moment, pondering the miserable creature.

""Do you really think I could even...hold a gun like this?""

The cops looked back and forth between him and the neverending stream information on their HUDs.

At last, wordlessly and with a shared look of distain, they left for the elevator.

Gauge barely made it back inside. Out of the frying pan, into the fire of Hell that coursed through his very veins.

Lash and Tejas watched their redeemer twisting there on the floor, helplessly.

Benji, much to everyone's surprise, knelt down next to the victim. Benji wasn't known to be an altruist, yet he produced a mysterious jar, clearly intended as some remedy to ease Gauge's suffering.

It was several seconds before Gauge even noticed.

""Drink this,"" commanded Benji.

Gauge was dumbfounded.

""Your insides are dissolving. You have a chemical problem, and I am a chemist. So listen to me. Drink it.""

Every faculty of reason that had survived the scourge of the amp told Gauge to resist, yet what was he resisting for? His life was about to be over. What more did he have to lose?

""Drink it.""

No, there had to be some other way. The elevator was always late. The cops would still be standing there waiting for it. They could speed him to the hospital. But why? Gauge had fought so hard to get away from them. Now the only thing standing in the way of Benji's offer was pride.

""Why should I?"" Gauge gasped at him, as defiantly as he could muster.

""Because,"" Benji, who almost never said anything to anyone, rasped, ""It will clear everything out of your system. Everything.""

Gauge tried to look at him skeptically, but all he could manage was a look of pain.

""It's for my cleansing ritual,"" Benji creepily continued, ""And it's the last of my supply. So please, take it, before the damage is permanent. Otherwise, it will be a waste.""

This unexpected ray of kindness, from so unlikely a source, finally broke through to Gauge. He gave in.

""Well,"" nodded Benji as Gauge choked down the last few sips of the brackish piss, ""That ought to do it.""

And, miraculously, it did. Gauge sat there on the floor, soaked in sweat and whatever else, but still, and alive.

Benji chuckled with a perfect brew of self-satisfaction, an amount just small enough to keep Gauge from strangling him, ""It's the least I can do after selling your wheels to make rent this month."""
"Full Service Evictions part 2 (short story)Raymond idly flipped through channels on the TV. There wasn't much on at this hour; the movie channels had the usual assortment of bland, cookie-cutter blockbusters, but the rest were showing reruns of old sitcoms, or talk shows of little interest. A few had already switched to infomercials; that usually didn't happen for another hour, but was increasingly common these days. He winced as one channel played an especially loud advertisement; flipping past it quickly, he stole a look at the hallway, hoping that the noise hadn't awakened his lady.

He settled on an old crime drama from the 1970s. The on-screen guide told him it was a made-for-TV movie. He smiled, popped open a generic-brand 40 ounce malt liquor, and settled in for the kitschy low-grade noir. It seemed like a perfect way to kill the next two hours. Not quite enough to make it to daylight, but close.

From within the walls came scurrying noises; one went straight up and then across the ceiling, between floors. He shivered as he thought of the rats that infested this building. There seemed to be less of them lately, but it was difficult to focus on that when one of them was literally overhead. He tried to hold back his disgust.

Raymond heard shuffling noises coming from the hallway; he didn't turn to see who it was. The on-screen action showed the toughs chasing a lone police officer, panting and wide-eyed with terror. He watched with glazed eyes, not wanting to miss a moment.

""Are you *ever* coming to bed, Raymond?"" The shrill harping could only come from one person.

""Get off my case, Clara,"" he retorted. ""It's not like I have to get up early tomorrow.""

""Yeah...tomorrow, or any *other* day,"" she huffed. ""Did you even *work* tonight?""

""I got done *early*!"" he snapped. ""It was just a quick courier job. No hassles. Everything went smooth as a peach.""

Clara moved in front of the TV, just as the bruisers caught up with the hapless cop. ""More hustles with your hoodlum friends? Are you *ever* going to get a real job, like you promised?""

Raymond bobbed and weaved, trying to regain line-of-sight with the victorious goons. ""Damn it, you're blocking my view! Get the hell out of the way!""

Defiantly, she switched off the TV and stood there, her gaze like icy daggers. Glowering, he clicked the remote to turn it back on. Nothing happened; she was blocking the sensor. Clara smirked as she returned his angry stare.

""You bitch!"" he shouted. ""You made my miss my favorite part!""

Clara clucked her tongue. ""Well, isn't *that* too bad. You already missed the good parts of your son's childhood. I don't hear you whining about *that*!""

Raymond threw his hands up in the air. ""You *wanted* me to come back, after all these years, to try to help you raise him! And here I am! I bring in money when I can, and I keep quiet about living here so you can continue to collect your child assistance! What does it take to make you happy?""

Clara stabbed her finger in his direction. ""How about serving as a better *role model*? I almost had him going to school regularly until *you* showed up. Now he's out on the streets, acting like *you*! The extra money you bring in isn't worth the bad influence!""

Raymond pointed past her, to the TV. ""It got you this fancy cable-TV package, didn't it? You know you watch it as much as I do.""

""Stop changing the subject!"" Clara raged. ""Do you even *know* where your son is right now? How can you raise him if he isn't even *here*? He's out on the streets *right now*, following in your disgraceful footsteps!""

""So what do you want me to do?"" Raymond snorted. ""Leave?""

""Oh, isn't that just *typical*!"" Clara exploded. ""You're gone for years and years, then one day you show up out of nowhere, promising you've changed and that you'll make up for time lost, but once you run into the slightest bit of static, you want to leave again! You're a worthless excuse for a man.""

Raymond didn't reply. He just stared at the ground.

""Why did you *really* come back?"" she accused. ""Did you just need a place to crash?"" Raymond looked up at her suddenly, a sheepish look in his eyes.

Clara gaped. ""Really? That's *it*? You're only here for what *you* can get out of it? All your promises were just *empty*?""

Raymond looked towards the hallway. ""Look at me when I'm talking to you!"" Clara steamed.

""Good job,"" Raymond chided. ""You've woken her up.""

From behind the door jamb, a pair of wide eyes peered fearfully into the living room. As Clara turned to look, they disappeared back into the hallway.

""Muriel?"" Clara cooed. ""Just go back to bed, sweetie.""

Muriel appeared again. ""I can't sleep.""

Raymond gestured angrily. ""See what you did? *I* was being quiet until *you* showed up.""

""Don't *even* start with me!"" Clara turned toward Muriel. ""Why can't you sleep, baby?""

Muriel paused, her eyes fluttering shyly. ""I smell smoke.""

Raymond and Clara looked around nervously, sniffing the air. ""Hey, I think I smell it too,"" Raymond noted.

The building's fire alarm abruptly started to blare. Clara strode towards her bedroom. ""Muriel, honey? Get your jacket and shoes and follow me outside!"" She turned to look at Raymond, but he had already bounded out the window onto the fire escape. She sighed heavily and disappeared inside her room.

Outside, the tenants gaped as smoke drifted out of the open windows and through the seams of the building's failed weatherproofing. Clara and Muriel walked around from the side of the building, sniffling and coughing lightly. They came to a stop a safe distance away, on the sidewalk opposite their tenement, surrounded by neighbors and curious onlookers. Clara swept her eyes over the crowd for Raymond; he was nowhere to be found. Clara scowled angrily.

""That smoke smelled funny, momma,"" Muriel piped up.

""What are you talking about?"" Clara replied dismissively. ""It's smoke. It all smells the same.""

""No, momma,"" Muriel challenged, clinging to her mother's gown. ""It smelled...waxy.""

A nearby kid turned to Muriel. ""Yeah, I noticed that too,"" he concurred. ""Like the kind they have at magic shows. What does it mean?""

A distant din of sirens slowly approached. The crowd watched a convoy of trucks arrive; they looked like police vans, though they didn't bear any government insignia. As they stopped, several people in dark-colored guard uniforms emerged; there were both men and women, though all of them were stoutly built. One of them was taller and thinner; he wore a suit, and observed the action from a distance.

Instead of checking on the tenants, the guards surrounded the building, forming a perimeter. Clara could barely make out a dim emblem on the nearest van, seemingly dark-gray on a black background, consisting of stylized renditions of the letters ""U"" and ""P"". She heard one of them remark on their cell phone that all entrances and exits had been successfully barricaded.

A group of security officers, wearing gas masks, ran inside the building. Another addressed the crowd. ""Remain calm, everyone,"" he assured. ""The smoke will be fixed in just a few moments.""

More sirens converged on the area; before long, a squad of police vans had arrived. Other than their prominent government logos, they looked identical to the vans that arrived before. They parked across the street on both ends, forming a barrier. The officers quickly disembarked and stood in a barricade in front of their vehicles, joined by several of the security personnel. An uneasy murmur emerged from the crowd of tenants, and many of the passersby quickly tried to leave the scene.

Clara noticed that the smoke had thinned out considerably. She also saw that more windows had been opened up. Some were at the ends of hallways, but many more were from the inside of people's apartments, windows that didn't lead to fire escapes. Apparently, they had entered the apartments! She raised her hand to object, but quickly withdrew it, and just watched sadly.

The kid that had been standing near Muriel marched confidently up to the waiting police officers. ""What's going on?"" he demanded. ""When is the fire department going to show up?""

""They're not,"" the officer shot back, haughtily. ""The smoke was just to get all of you out of the building."" The crowd's grumbling became more incensed. ""But it's two-thirty in the morning!"" the kid pouted. ""That's all right,"" the officer scolded. ""Most of you were still awake."" The kid's eyes dropped; he stared morosely at the ground. ""What's going on?""

The officer flashed a surly smile. ""You're about to find out.""

A security guard with a bullhorn spoke. ""OK, listen up, people,"" he barked. ""Those of you who are behind on your rent...consider yourself evicted. Those of you who are meeting your obligations...you can go back inside. And anyone with an active warrant for his or her arrest..."" Clara noted with alarm that the police officers had drawn their weapons; a few had tear-gas cannons mounted to the top of their shotguns. The overdriven voice on the bullhorn continued. ""...will be going away with these fine officers."" The speaker stopped a moment to sneer. ""And you may as well go quietly...there's no sense in adding 'resisting arrest' to your charges.""

A panicked din arose from the crowd. ""Now, if you don't know which you are,"" the voice blared, ""form a line in front of the building's entrance.""

Clara swallowed hard, grabbed Muriel's hand, and slowly walked forward. A throng of her neighbors meandered in the same direction, joining one of multiple lines. Clara noticed uneasily that a number of the residents, and a few of the passersby, had simply lied down on the ground and put their hands behind their heads. It unsettled her to realize how familiar they were with the procedure for being arrested.

For the first time, she noticed a new group of people had arrived, wearing navy-blue jumpsuits and carrying a variety of packing supplies. They were followed by large spider-legged robots, with platforms where their heads should be, loaded up with collapsed paper boxes. All of them disappeared into the front door. She wondered if anyone else had noticed them; no one seemed to react to their presence, as if giant spider-robots were somehow an everyday occurrence.

The line moved slowly. Most people were simply sent aside, to wait inside the unmarked vans. A few were taken away by the police. Not once did she see anyone allowed back inside. She heard part of the discussion involving the resident in front of her. ""But what about all my stuff?"" the obese man protested. ""It'll be packed up and stored, and treated as collateral, until you make good on your debts,"" came the gruff reply. ""But I can't afford that!"" the fat man pouted. ""Then it'll probably end up in a thrift store,"" the guard snarled. ""Now go sit in the van, if you want a place to sleep for the night."" The portly fellow, looking chastened, slowly lumbered toward the waiting van.

Clara and Muriel were now at the front of the line. ""Hold still,"" she was ordered, as a security guard held up a tablet to her. A few seconds later, her name and photo splashed across the screen. ""Is this you?"" demanded the guard. ""Yes,"" she replied meekly.

The guard studied the screen for a few moments, her long blonde hair packed tightly into her cap. ""You recently caught up with your past-due rent, but we have evidence you've got an unapproved roommate."" The guard showed her the screen; there was a photo of Raymond, but with a different last name than she knew him to have. ""Yes,"" she mumbled. The guard pressed a few buttons on the screen, then turned it towards her again. A video showed Raymond inhaling some sort of white powder up his nose. ""We recorded this video a few hours ago. We have several more just like it, stretching back a few months.""

Clara's face fell. ""How did you get those videos? Where were the cameras?""

""They're mobile,"" the guard explained. ""The droids in your walls have extensive sensor packages. You probably heard them scurrying at all hours of the day.""

Clara looked alarmed. ""I thought those were rats!""

The guard appeared unmoved. ""They were, at first. The droids have been killing the vermin, patching up a lot of holes, making other interior repairs, and recording evidence on the tenants.""

The guard looked more closely at her screen. ""Your son Julio lives with you, right? Where is *he*?"" Clara looked down disconsolately. ""I don't know. Out with his friends, somewhere."" The guard shrugged. ""It's just as well. We've amassed a pretty big dossier on him, too. Lots of petty theft."" She played a series of videos for Clara, showing Julio hiding his ill-gotten gains in his bedroom. ""If he were here right now, he wouldn't be going with you — he'd be leaving with the police.""

Clara suddenly became aware of strident caterwauling, coming from behind the police vans. ""Don't you *dare* stand in my way!"" came the cry. ""I'm your boss! I pay your salaries! Now *move it*!"" Emerging from behind the perimeter was a smartly-dressed woman with a ruffled collar and a fierce gaze. She marched straight up to the guard interrogating Clara, trailed by two police officers serving as her security detail. ""And just what the *hell* is going on here?"" She thrust her open wallet into the guard's face.

""You don't need to show me your I.D."", the guard chided. ""I recognize you from the news. You've certainly made a name for yourself lately, councilwoman Karen. Now, how can I help you?""

""You can start by letting these people back into their homes!"" she demanded.

""I'm afraid that's impossible, councilwoman,"" the guard demurred. ""They're all being evicted for cause.""

""But they have *rights*!"" she protested. ""There are *court* hearings for this kind of thing! And while the details are being sorted out, they can continue to live here!"" As she spoke, a few of the police officers ambled towards her. The others remained behind to secure the perimeter and to keep an eye on the arrestees in the vans.

""They've already vacated the premises, and their belongings are being packed,"" the guard countered. ""At this point, the eviction is simply a fact.""

""The *hell* it is!"" councilwoman Karen blubbered. ""How dare you talk to me like that! I can have you arrested *right now*!"" He turned back to the police and stared hotly at them. ""Did you hear me? Arrest them *this instant*!""

The nearest police officer smiled. ""Hi, Sandra; how have you been?"" The guard returned his smile. ""Hi, Charles! Not too bad, considering. I was worried after our department got defunded and I lost my job, but I got picked up by this new outfit pretty quickly. They were only too happy to hire highly-trained law-enforcement personnel! I think most of us ended up here.""

Charles looked around. ""Yeah, I recognize a lot of faces. Glad to see you all bounced back!""

""What are you *doing*?"" the councilwoman demanded. ""I said arrest them this *instant*!""

Charles shook his head. ""I'm not about to do that to an old co-worker. She may not be with the police any more, but that wasn't by choice, and it's obvious she's still one of the few holding civil society together."" He swept his arm over the rest of the security guards. ""And that goes for them too!""

""Don't you *dare* defy me!"" the councilwoman screeched. ""I'll have your badges for this!""

Charles coolly ignored her. ""By the way, Sandra...are there any more openings at your firm?""

""Plenty!"" Sandra gushed. ""They need a lot more trained law-enforcement officers for what *they* have planned. They'll probably pick you up in no time flat!"" She looked at the police officers crowding around. ""And I'm sure that goes for the *rest* of you, too!""

""That sounds great,"" interjected one of the officers in the councilwoman's security detail. ""We're getting mighty tired of taking her abuse,"" he added, pointing at Karen.

""So what do you say, councilwoman Karen?"" challenged Officer Charles, as Karen gaped. ""Do you want to defund the *rest* of us, right *now*? A writ of authority from the government is less important to me than doing the right thing, which these people clearly are.""

""I...er..."" Karen stammered. Charles continued. ""And don't bother threatening us with the courts. You *know* how backed up they are. They wouldn't even get to this for a few months."" He leaned in more closely. ""Keep in mind...the city council can't even stop the wave of crime on the streets. What do you think your chances are of stopping a supposedly rogue police agency run by a private company? Ultimately, that's just another crime wave that you can do nothing about.""

Councilwoman Karen moped forlornly. ""We'll all have our day in court...as soon as possible."" She straightened herself, and tried to put on a brave face. ""I think we're done here."" She turned to march away. Her security detail smirked at her behind her back as they followed.

Security guard Sandra, staring levelly at Karen's retreating form, muttered under her breath. ""You have *no* idea how right you are.""

She resumed addressing Clara. ""So...we found Raymond's drug stash while we were packing up. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to learn that you qualify to be evicted.""

Muriel cried and clutched her mom tightly; tears formed in Clara's eyes. ""What must I do to get my stuff back?""

""A few things,"" the guard commanded. ""You need to find a new place to live, we need to make sure you don't have any other outstanding debts, and given what we found, you need to pass a drug test."" She eyed Clara warily. ""Do you think you will?""

""Yes!"" Clara asserted. ""I don't do drugs. I didn't even know *he* was doing them.""

The guard smiled; her eyes beamed with sympathy. ""Then this will probably all be over soon! We'll put you and your daughter up for the night; don't worry, it won't be expensive. We know you can't afford much. Tomorrow, we'll get this straightened out, and you can get on with your lives.""

""We can't get our old apartment back?""

Sandra gazed at Clara levelly. ""You couldn't afford your old apartment, not without Raymond's money. And we have no record of him being employed. So he was probably getting paid under the table. We'll be dealing with him separately. For now...if you two get in the van, we'll take you to a place you can sleep for tonight."" Clara nodded, and she and Muriel slowly made their way to the waiting wagons.

As the guards continued to sort the tenants, officer Charles walked up to the man in the suit. ""I take it you're in charge of this operation?""

""Indeed,"" replied the man. ""My name is Jason. How can I help you, officer?""

""So, funny story,"" began Charles. ""We don't actually have space in our jails for all these people. Is there anything you can do to help?""

""Indeed!"" beamed Jason. ""Let me make the arrangements.""

Clara nervously watched a security guard approach the van. He smiled as he caught her eye. ""OK, people,"" he began. ""Tonight, you'll be taken to a spare dormitory at the local college. The families with children will get first pick of the private rooms; the rest of you may end up in bunks. If you cooperate with us, you may be allowed to live there for the time being. You'll have to share facilities with others, and keep them clean, and in any case, it's better than being homeless.""

""Will we be safe?"" Clara clutched Muriel tightly.

""Not to worry, ma'am,"" the guard assured. ""Anyone truly dangerous has already been filtered out. And the whole place is under A.I.-driven surveillance, 24 hours a day. If anything bad happens, it'll get stopped pretty quickly.""

""Is that legal?"" The obese man Clara had seen earlier looked incredulous.

""You'll have to consent to it, as part of the terms and conditions for staying there.""

""What if I don't *want* to? You can't *make* us do that!"" The obese man was defiant.

""You're free to take your chances on the street,"" the guard offered, pointing away. ""Though I must say, that alley doesn't look very inviting. What kind of hotel room can you afford right now?""

The portly guy looked crestfallen. ""Fine...I accept.""

""Why does the college have a spare dormitory?"" a young man asked.

The guard demurred. ""It's not really my place to speak for them, but it's my understanding that parents don't want to pay for education when their kids never seem to be in class, opting to join protests and the like. So they're having trouble retaining students."" He smirked before continuing. ""Also, college is so expensive these days, students have begun taking their first few years of undergraduate classes at community colleges or trade schools. Only then do they find a college that'll let them transfer their credits. The place you're going tonight is one of the colleges that *doesn't* allow that. So they're hurting pretty badly."" The guard shrugged. ""I mean, it works out well for *you*, and for the firm, so I'm not going to complain.""

""What firm?"" a middle-aged lady asked. ""Who do you work for?""

""It's called Full Service Evictions, but they're a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unlimited Partners. They have a vision for fixing the problems that the government can't, and turning a tidy profit while doing so. And unlike the government, *they're* hiring police officers right now.""

""Who *else* are they hiring?"" the young man interrupted. ""I'm more than willing to work, but times are really tough.""

""We can sort through all of that tomorrow,"" the guard offered. ""You all need to pay off your debts, and if the firm can make use of your skills, that helps both of us!""

""That sounds great,"" sighed the young man sanguinely. ""I can't believe this eviction might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

""That's what Unlimited Partners is all about!"" the guard trilled. ""Win-win scenarios, and making full use of available resources. I think you'll find them a vast improvement over the failing government.""

""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" Clara added. ""It's a pretty low bar to start with.""

The guard, and everyone sitting in the van, shared a laugh.

""OK, officer Charles, I've got a solution worked out,"" Jason explained. ""There's an older dorm at the same college where the tenants are being housed; it's scheduled for demolition, but that's been delayed, since the college can't afford it. It should be good enough for prisoners. They're certainly nicer accommodations than they'd have in jail!""

""But will it be secure?"" Officer Charles seemed skeptical. ""We don't want them escaping.""

""Not to worry!"" Jason assured. ""Several security drones are being moved there, as we speak. They're capable of tasing a moving target from fifty yards away. Plus, we're including two drones armed with sniper rifles. And all of them are tied together with surveillance A.I., monitored by human oversight. No one is getting out of there unless we say so.""

""Where did you get such amazing equipment?"" Charles marveled.

""In bankruptcy, believe it or not,"" Jason related. ""The companies that made these devices intended to sell them to the government, but after a fierce series of protests, the contracts were canceled. They then found they were legally blocked from selling their products to anyone else. But *acquiring* those companies was still legal, which we did for pennies on the dollar, and now we use the equipment for our own purposes.""

""Very clever,"" Charles replied with a smile.

""It's really just a consequence of the central problem of representative government,"" Jason explained. ""If a lawyer can't make a living, finding clients that want to pay for their services, then they go out of business and become a politician. These bad lawyers then write laws that are analyzed by *good* lawyers, who find plenty of loopholes in them, allowing them to continue to do whatever they want, unimpeded by the authorities.""

Charles scratched his chin. ""I've never heard it put like that before. That actually explains a lot!""

Jason punched a few more buttons on his phone. ""We'll send the directions to your vans' onboard computers. Our equipment knows how to talk to them; after all, we own the same kind of vans.""

""That sounds great!"" Officer Charles beamed. ""We really appreciate your firm's help. Oh...on that note...can we all get your card or something? None of us know if we'll get defunded soon. And our old co-workers seem to be really happy with their new jobs.""

""Absolutely!"" Jason opened up his briefcase, and fetched a small stack of business cards, handing them to Charles. ""Feel free to hand these out to whomever you like."" He grabbed a larger fistful of cards and handed those over too. ""Including anyone that isn't here tonight.""

""I'd be glad to!"" Officer Charles looked around. ""So, are we done here? I think all the tenants have been dealt with, and the movers and cleaners have already gotten to work.""

""We sure are. As soon as the tenants get taken to their new home, I'm off to the next raid of the evening.""

""Really?"" Officer Charles sounded concerned. ""You're working awfully late tonight.""

""No, I'm like you; I'm part of the night shift,"" Jason explained. ""But a few more successes like this under my belt, and I'll probably be allowed to change to the day shift. No one starts at the top, after all.""

""*That's* for sure!"" Officer Charles laughed. ""Hey, do you need police backup for that? I mean, we're already here, and we're *supposed* to get relieved, but given how things are, I never know if anyone is going to show up for the next shift.""

""We'd really appreciate that!"" Jason concurred. He looked at his phone. ""They should be ready for us by the time we arrive.""

""Works for me! See you there!"" Charles and Jason each headed to their respective vans, and the caravan drove away into the night. A series of flatbed trucks, loaded with steel shipping containers, moved into the vacated space. The first movers emerged from the building with furniture, with spider-bots close on their heels, carrying plastic-wrapped boxes."
"[Short story, series] Mecha SaviorEric Thompson scanned over his three computer screens, displaying the high-level dashboard for Unlimited Partners. He smiled as he contemplated the sea of green, with only a few scattered yellow areas. Near him hovered an executive intern, assigned for the day to trail Eric and learn what his job was like.

""So as you can see,"" Eric began, ""our madly daring idea is actually bearing fruit! Overall success depends on team-building; that's one of my specialties. But then the people I choose have to carry *that* on to the teams they build, and so on. All of these levels have to work, or the entire project could easily fail with speed."" He turned to look at the intern. ""There's no magic formula for accomplishing that; you have to be well-learned and thoughtful, you have to make your best judgment, then observe their results and see what needs to be changed, without succumbing to micromanagement. All I can say about my method is, I try to hire good people and then get out of their way. So far, it's working for me.""

""Very inspirational, sir,"" the intern chimed. ""I hope to contribute to that as much as possible. I believe this company has a bright future!""

Without warning, a red rectangle pushed its way onto his dashboard. Eric chuckled to himself. ""Right on time."" He clicked the high-priority emergency notification and began reading. Within moments, his eyes glazed over and his jaw dropped. The intern began to shiver uncontrollably. Blinking rapidly, Eric pondered who in the organization could handle this crisis.

His phone rang. He picked it up quickly; he didn't need to see who it was.

""What can you tell me about the intruder?"" Eric said anxiously.

""It's heading for downtown Milleniaburg!"" his security chief replied breathlessly. ""An old-school jet airliner hijacking. They had no trouble slipping through the porous security of what's left of the government forces.""

""Not a big surprise,"" Eric lamented. ""But why are they attacking *us*? What's their motivation?""

""Information is still patchy,"" the chief related. ""But the hijackers claim to be people we banished.""

""Then what's the point of attacking us?"" Eric pondered. ""It's not like they want to return; there's nothing for them here, unless they clean up their act. Which they clearly haven't done.""

""I don't think they're acting entirely rationally, sir,"" the chief offered. ""We have to treat this as an existential threat, not as something we can fix.""

""But what are our options?"" Eric pleaded. But he knew the answer.

""We only have one, sir,"" the chief replied sanguinely. ""We have to shoot it down.""

""But that would be a disaster!"" Eric objected. ""Our credibility is based on demonstrating a better way to run things. If we just kill them indiscriminately, it'll set our cause back, possibly permanently!""

Eric could hear the sorrow in the chief's voice. ""They'll be in downtown Milleniaburg in thirty minutes. I don't think we have a choice.""

Eric's eyes glowed with sudden revelation. ""I think we might."" His skin flushed red as he took a deep breath. ""OK, you prepare to shoot them down, but don't fire until they're seconds from impact! I'm going to try something.""

""Like *what*?"" the chief pleaded. But Eric had already hung up.

At a workbench, deep within the 16otaku complex, Stacy pondered the red robotic gladiator. ""OK, buddy,"" she chirped, ""show me what you got!""

In a single fluid motion, it flipped onto its back, extended its legs, and popped open its main access panel. Stacy scratched at the empty air above it. ""You want a belly rub? Who wants a *belly rub*?"" she cooed.

""Oh, come on,"" Irwin chided, as the blue robot gladiator did the same thing for him. ""They're only *partially* sentient.""

""You keep saying that,"" Stacy countered, ""but these two keep doing things we don't understand. That's why we're having this examination, remember?""

Irwin shook his head. ""Big Daddy is adamant that it's nothing he's changed. So it has to be a crossed wire, or some undetected damage, somewhere. I'm not buying your theories.""

Stacy removed the outer circuit board and gently laid it on the bench. ""After everything you've seen them do, how can you really believe that?"" She gaped at what she saw. ""*What* the—""

""What...?"" Irwin replied tersely as he finished removing the blue bot's outer circuit board, revealing what was inside. ""Oh...oh my...""

Nothing they were looking at was familiar. There wasn't an inner circuit board; it appeared to be a tightly-constructed melange of custom parts, the function of which they could only guess at. Even the shapes of the components were novel. Were they capacitors? Transistors? Semiconductors? Functions seemed to blur together in a kaleidoscope of odd shapes, running over and under other parts to form a complex, yet strangely regular pattern. Clear tubes intertwined with mechanical parts, conducting neural tissue throughout the volume.

""*We* didn't build this!"" Stacy gasped. ""*They* must have built it themselves!""

""But what does it do?"" Irwin pondered. ""I mean, obviously they're running themselves with this, but why this arrangement? It doesn't...oh, wait. Maybe it does.""

""What?"" Stacy watched Irwin walk over to her bench and look inside the red droid.

""I think I get it,"" he postulated. ""Step back and look at the arrangement as a whole, not as parts. What does it look like?""

""Kind of like..."" Stacy's brow furrowed. ""I don't know, a sponge?"" Suddenly her eyes lit up. ""It's a big shock absorber!""

""Exactly!"" Irwin trilled. ""We attach circuit boards with shock-absorbing mounts, but this takes it to another level!"" He pondered the intricate assembly for a moment. ""*Several* levels, actually. I've never seen *anything* like this.""

""Let's not sell it short,"" Stacy sniffed. ""We've never even *thought* of anything like this.""

Irwin continued to remove exterior panels on the blue bot. ""I think something like this would drive us mad before we got anywhere close to finishing. Plus, we'd need the design insights of a...a...""

""A supercomputer,"" Stacy finished. ""A really big one. Like what all the bots form at night, when they're left alone. Remember, we're only here eight hours a day; they spend a lot of time by themselves. Looking into everything they get up to when we're away would be its own full-time job. Well, several, at least.""

""Wow, would you look at this?"" Irwin had finished removing exterior panels, as the blue bot continued to lie there supinely. ""Even the exoskeleton is different!""

Stacy leaned in to look. ""The beams are thinner, more numerous, and...very finely machined."" She pushed on one gently with her finger. ""It's metal, but it almost feels rubbery. They've strengthened it with...geometry?"" She lowered a magnifier lamp over it, and dialed up the power. ""Look at the intricate patterns running along the length! I'm not even sure what they do!""

Irwin shrugged. ""Well, we can stop *this* part of the investigation. We've answered our original question; now we know how their fighting skills have improved so much recently. We can do the rest from our desks, querying the database about these new designs and how they work."" He turned to the blue bot. ""So are you willing to tell us all about it?"" The blue bot responded by rotating its primary sensor array towards Irwin and mimicking a salute. Irwin laughed. ""I'll take that as a yes!"" He turned to Stacy. ""Now the *real* discovery begins!""

Stacy sighed. ""Just as soon as we finish putting them back together.""

They heard a noise behind them. The red bot, carrying its outer circuit board, had crawled up to them. It proffered two of its front legs upwards. ""Do you want a boost, little guy?"" Stacy cooed. She lifted him up and put him on the workbench. It crawled closer to the blue bot and gently tapped Irwin's hand twice. ""Oh, you have this under control?"" Irwin laughed. The red bot immediately grabbed an exterior panel and began reconnecting it to the blue bot. Irwin and Stacy both stepped back.

Stacy looked puzzled. ""How are they operating with their outer circuit boards disconnected?""

Irwin's expression became thoughtful. ""That does mostly diagnostic operations. We need it to see how they're doing, but apparently *they* don't. I guess they have other methods!""

Stacy frowned. ""And somehow, this all escaped the notice of Big Daddy?""

Irwin shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't ask the right questions. But now *we* have a chance to!"" Irwin's eyes shone with wonder. ""This is bound to be a mind-blowing experience!""

Stacy looked beatific. ""Just one more thing I can't wait to learn about!""

Irwin smiled. ""Do you feel like a proud parent as much as I do?""

Stacy giggled. ""Yes! Our babies are growing up.""

Suddenly, Sam burst into the room. Stacy turned to him, smiling broadly. ""Wait until you hear what *we've* learned!""

""Never mind that!"" Sam shouted. Stacy and Irwin both froze. Sam tried to catch his breath. ""We have a *much* more pressing matter! I need you two at the cubicles, *now*!"" He ran off. Stacy and Irwin exchanged worried glances, then ran after him.

They arrived to find a video conference with Eric Thompson, already in progress. ""So you see what we're up against? We don't have any good options. Your work, in its present condition, is our only hope!""

Stacy tapped Dwight on the shoulder. ""What is he talking about?""

Dwight's eyes seemed to be filled with a sepulchral darkness. ""A jet airliner has been hijacked, and is headed our way. Eric wants us to try to stop it with a mecha.""

Stacy froze. ""Seriously?""

""All I want to know,"" Eric pleaded, ""is if there's a *chance*!""

""The rocket limbs have had a few controlled burns,"" Gary explained. ""They all worked as expected. But we haven't actually tried to fly it yet.""

Eric smiled. ""Well, today's the day! Are you up for it?""

""We've never even taken it *outside*!"" Isabel protested. ""In *theory*, it should work. All our tests have come back positive. But it's never been tried in the field!""

Eric wrung his hands. ""I'm sorry to ask this of you, but our backs are really up against the wall!"" He looked more unnerved than any of them had seen before. ""And I'm not going to sugarcoat this; you'll all be risking your lives. But a lot more lives hang in the balance, not to mention the success of our entire company! This is our make-or-break moment!"" He hung his head. ""I can't ask you to take this chance. You have to *choose* to.""

No one spoke. Then Dwight piped up. ""Some day I'll be an old man in a rocking chair on a porch, and I'll look back at this time...and if I don't act now, that old man is going to regret it and kick himself.""

""Yeah!"" Stacy exhorted. ""Let's *do* this!""

Sam could hardly contain himself. ""Then...I've always wanted to say this...*mecha pilots, assemble*!""

Gary, Dwight, Stacy, and Irwin, cheering loudly, ran for the hangar, the others close behind.

Eric turned his head; the camera followed to watch them leave. ""God speed, my brain-trust warriors.""

""How much fuel do we have on board?"" Gary asked breathlessly.

""Five hundred and twenty pounds,"" Dwight replied, gasping for air. ""We haven't refueled since our last burn.""

""No time now! What's our battery charge?""

""They should be full,"" Isabel answered. ""I left it plugged in.""

They arrived in the hangar. The four pilots ran off to their respective flight decks. The rest attended to the remote monitoring and diagnostic stations. ""Big Daddy!"" Sam shouted into the microphone. ""We're taking out the flying mecha. Are all systems go?""

""I heard about the hijacking, and the plan,"" Big Daddy answered in his usual sedate manner. ""All systems are go. My confidence is high. I just wish there was time to add fuel.""

Isabel threw a knife switch to raise the hangar door, as the various parts of the mecha powered on. ""Oh, heck,"" she said suddenly, as she ran towards the mecha, which was flexing its joints, doing its final tests. ""It's still plugged in!"" she yelled. ""I need a minute!""

Gary's voice squelched over the radio link. ""Uh...Sam? How do we get this thing outside? It's too tall for the hangar door.""

Sam stared blankly. ""Um...not sure. We've never tried it before.""

Isabel finished yanking out the assortment of extension cords, then high-tailed it back to her workstation.

Stacy's voice piped up. ""I think we have to crawl.""

The mecha lowered itself to the ground, and clumsily put its hands on the ground. After a few false starts, it began crawling towards the hangar door, its pace quickening as the crew got the hang of it. ""You know what they say,"" Dwight quipped. ""You have to crawl before you can fly.""

They reached the taxiway outside the hangar; unfamiliar sunlight poured into the mecha's sensors. Quickly, it adjusted to the new inputs, and gave its pilots a clear picture of their surroundings. Their mission computers all bleeped; the intercom link surged with Sam's voice. ""OK, I've linked you to the radar tracking of the bogey. We've got ten minutes until it reaches the outskirts of the city, and fifteen minutes until it reaches Unlimited Partners central HQ.""

Gary pondered the trajectory as Dwight fired the rocket limbs, preparing them for flight. ""We should be able to intercept it at the city's edge...but we're going to have to use our full thrust. This is going to be *really* rough. Are you all willing?""

All pilots answered affirmatively. ""Then off we go!"" Gary cheered as he slid all four thrust-power sliders to their maximum. The mecha shuddered uncertainly, slowly lifting off the ground, then wavered a little bit. As all four limbs pointed themselves down, in the same direction, suddenly it began picking up speed. It took off into the morning sky, piercing through the morning fog and vanishing.

""Aaaaah! I can't do this!"" Irwin yelled. ""I feel like I'm being crushed!""

""One moment!"" Gary yelled. ""OK, your suit should be extra pressurized now. Any better?""

""This really hurts!"" Irwin continued to scream.

""Keep screaming!"" Stacy yelled. ""It'll help keep you from blacking out!""

""She's right!"" Dwight interjected. ""Scream, tense up all your muscles, and hold in your stomach! We'll have to deal with maximum G forces until we get there!""

Irwin continued to scream; Gary turned down the volume on his intercom. ""As long as we can still hear him, it means he's OK. Some prior training for G forces would have been really helpful, but it's too late now.""

""Is this right?"" Stacy interrupted. ""Only seven minutes to intercept?""

""Sure looks like it,"" Gary agreed. ""The rocket-limbs are working really well. We're burning an awful lot of fuel, though. It'll take four hundred pounds just to reach the intercept point. I just hope Irwin can take it. Irwin, you hanging in there?""

""Aaaaaaaaaugh!"" Irwin continued to scream. ""I love iiiiiiiit! There's nothing else I'd rather doooooooo!""

Dwight was unconvinced. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""As long as he's still screaming, he's alive,"" Gary joked.

""He's fine,"" Isabel radioed. ""His vital signs are all good. Keep doing what you're doing, Irwin!""

""Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" he continued to yell.

""Can you imagine what they must be thinking on the ground?"" Stacy wondered.

""The anime fans are probably having a religious experience,"" Gary offered. ""Assuming they can see us.""

""That brings up an important issue,"" Dwight pointed out. ""What happens when the *hijackers* see us?""

""That depends,"" Gary offered. ""Are they going to be looking for a giant flying robot?""

""Uh...hmmm...good point. We'll have to hope we surprise them.""

The mecha continued to fly across the sky, angling upwards, its rocket-limbs spewing white-hot flames twice as long as its body. The mission computers had calculated that, given their current trajectory, that at the intercept point, they'd be five hundred feet above the airliner. ""I believe we can drop on them from above,"" Gary suggested. ""I think that's our best plan.""

""It's getting hot in here,"" Stacy observed. ""How's our cooling system?""

""Not yet running at full,"" Gary answered. ""I can turn them up. We should have sufficient battery power. Isabel?""

""You sure do,"" Isabel assured. ""You were charged to the top when you left.""

""I think I'm finally getting the hang of this,"" Irwin suddenly added, sounding strained.

""Glad to hear it, buddy!"" Gary chimed. ""I'm going to need your fine motor skills when we move to intercept. You ready for this?""

""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" Irwin gushed.

""Just keep up your G-force countermeasures,"" Isabel reminded. ""You're doing good, but don't relax them.""

""Not a problem,"" Irwin assured. ""They've become second nature.""

The rockets dropped their power slightly; the flight computers had adjusted the autopilot for the intercept. Gliding over the river that formed the northern border of the city, the mecha started to rotate in the air. Gary's voice filled the intercom. ""Hold on to your stomachs, people. This is going to feel really weird. Try not to get airsick.""

The mecha pivoted in the air, and pointed its limbs down, allowing it to hover. It came to a stop.

""The airliner is thirty seconds away, and we're seven hundred feet above it,"" Gary announced.

""And they don't *see* us?"" Stacy sounded incredulous. ""Not even on radar?""

""I'm not picking up any radar from them,"" Dwight observed. ""They must be operating on visual flight rules. Not a surprise if they're amateurs. They're probably just fixated on their target. Fortunately for us.""

The aircraft finally became visible on their external cameras. ""I'm ready for the intercept thrust,"" Gary announced. ""Irwin, you ready to grapple?""

""I was *born* to do this!"" Irwin exulted.

Gary counted down. ""Six...five...four...three...two...one...BURN!""

The mecha's limbs flung themselves back, and its rockets fired. The external cameras showed the plane approach; a few seconds before impact, its limbs swung down again, to slow its descent. With a loud, resounding crunch, the mecha impacted with the airliner. Quickly, its arms dove under the wings, and its hands met on the plane's roof, near the first-class section, putting the plane into a full nelson. Its feet pushed backwards, finding their grip on each side of the tail wing. A few tense moments passed.

""We're not stopping them!"" Gary shouted frantically. ""They've turned up their engines, and we don't have the fuel to use ours to slow them down!""

There was a few moments of silence. ""Can we kick our legs, like we're on a swing?"" Stacy suggested. ""If we can point the airliner upward, maybe we can get control of it.""

Gary sounded unsure. ""Irwin? Do the arms have a good grip?""

Irwin sounded confident. ""They're not going *anywhere*. Start kicking!""

The mecha's feet pulled themselves from the tail wings and began bucking wildly. Slowly, the airliner began to pitch upwards.

""I wonder what *this* looks like on the ground,"" Stacy asked sardonically.

Sam's voice, over the radio, feigned embarrassment. ""Um, well, when an airplane and a giant robot love each other *very* much...""

""It's working!"" Irwin suddenly exclaimed. ""Stop kicking! The airplane is in an aerodynamic stall. Its engines aren't enough to keep it in the air. Just a little bit of thrust from our legs, and we should be able to bring this unholy union to the ground!""

The mecha and airplane, locked in their hostile embrace, continued to plummet downwards.

""Why do you think the airliner hasn't cut its engines?"" Dwight asked. ""That would make our job a lot more difficult.""

""Maybe they didn't think of it,"" Gary suggested. ""We jolted them pretty hard when we hit; maybe they're unconscious.""

""Or maybe they're just panicking,"" Stacy wryly observed.

""Let's just hope our luck doesn't run out!"" Gary added. ""I think I can guide us to that empty field near the interstate. I'll try to slow down before we hit, but I can't guarantee anything. We're getting dangerously low on fuel. Brace for impact!""

On the ground, traffic on the interstate had come to a halt. People had left their cars to gawk at the garishly-colored spectacle plummeting towards them. As the airliner's jet engines continued to strain against its captor, the mecha fired its rockets in a finely-coordinated pattern, trying to steer them to the grassy plain, one of the few areas nearby that wasn't either trees or buildings. A few moments before reaching the ground, the mecha's leg-rockets suddenly flared brightly, slowing their descent and starting a few small brush fires. With a surprisingly gentle crushing noise, the airliner landed on the ground, the mecha still firmly attached to its top.

They continued to slide along the ground. ""Their engines are still firing! If we don't stop them, they'll drag us both into the river!""

""How about if I pinch their engines?"" Irwin offered. ""I'll have to let go with the arms, but I should be able to do this.""

""I think that's our best bet,"" Gary agreed. ""Do it!""

The mecha's arms let go. Quickly, it slid down the length of the airliner, but suddenly, the legs grappled the aircraft's sides, stopping its motion. Now in position, the arms reached towards the engines and crushed them with its hands. Jet fuel sprayed from the wounded turbines as the airliner and its giant passenger slid along the ground for several hundred more feet, finally coming to a stop.

The external microphones picked up a buzzing sound, growing louder. ""Where did the drones come from?"" Stacy asked. ""The highway?""

""That's it!"" Gary suddenly interjected. ""Irwin, rip the roof off of the flight deck! Let the drones take care of the hijackers!""

""You got it!"" The mecha shimmied up the length of the airliner; when it got near the front, its giant hands dug its fingers under the sides, peeling the roof back like a giant sardine can. Four hijackers stood in the exposed flight deck, gaping upwards in sheer terror. Quickly, the drones swarmed them; a few precisely-fired taser bolts later, and they all collapsed to the ground.

""YOU DID IT!"" a voice on the radio yelled. More cheering could be heard in the background. Stacy reacted with surprise. ""Wait, was that Eric Thompson?""

""It's me, and everyone else at headquarters!"" Eric answered. ""Plus several million more viewers on TV.""

""Wow,"" Stacy stammered. ""Way to bury the lede there, boss.""

""Are you kidding?"" Eric gushed. ""We wouldn't have missed this for the world!""

""Uh..."" Irwin began. ""Glad to be of service?""

The external microphones now picked up the cheers of the passengers. The emergency doors had opened, the exit chutes had inflated, and passengers were sliding out of the stricken aircraft as quickly as they could. Most of them gawked at the giant robot, which continued to sit astride the airplane, like a brightly-colored cowboy on a white horse. A few had run off, to stamp out the small brush fires caused by the mecha's rockets.

The external cameras showed the highway, the passengers having left their cars en masse. All were cheering and clapping.

""Did we actually live through that?"" Irwin's voice gasped weakly. ""The adrenaline is wearing off. I think I'm going to lose it.""

""Permission to lose it granted,"" Sam jokingly intoned. ""You've all done a great job.""

""You know what would be awesome?"" Dwight piped up. ""We should fly away from here, back to base, and salute in the air for everyone on the highway.""

""Not going to happen,"" Isabel related over the radio. ""You only have thirty pounds of fuel left.""

""Can we siphon anything from the airliner?"" Stacy asked.

Isabel paused for a moment. ""You don't have anything to siphon with,"" she sighed. ""We never thought to add such an attachment.""

""Then what do we do?"" Dwight pined. ""We can't just lay here and wait for a big flatbed to pick us up. That'd be embarrassing!""

""There's a truck stop about two miles down the highway,"" Sam offered. ""Diesel fuel is close enough to aircraft fuel for the mecha's systems. And between your remaining battery power, and the internal generators, you have enough power to..."" Sam paused for a moment. ""To walk there.""

""Well, I guess that'll still look pretty cool,"" Dwight agreed reluctantly. ""But not what I was hoping for.""

Gary's voice crackled over the mecha's loudspeakers. ""Citizens, please give me some space. I need to leave."" The passengers obediently formed a wide circle around the mecha. Slowly, it moved to stand up and dismount the airliner, to the cheers of everyone nearby. Unsteadily, the mecha walked towards the highway; the circle of people parted to let them through.

""Blast off! Blast off!"" the kids yelled, picked up by the external microphones. ""See, I knew they'd want that,"" Dwight sighed. ""We need to plan better in the future.""

Gary's voice once again blared from the loudspeaker. ""Sorry, kids. Not enough fuel. But maybe next time!"" All four pilots could hear their disappointed whines. Gary continued. ""Hey, c'mon, kids! I'm still a giant flying robot!"" The kids quickly began cheering again. The mecha slowly, clumsily walked away.

""OK, I think our autopilot can handle this,"" Gary declared. ""Just watch for sinkholes or loose soil.""

As they neared the highway, the disembarked passengers continued to cheer and clap. The mecha stopped and stood there. The loudspeaker crackled once again with Gary's voice. ""Citizens, please move your vehicles. I have to get home."" They finally stopped cheering, went back into their cars, and got out of the way. The mecha crawled up the embankment, walked across the lanes of traffic, and began trudging down the highway in the slow lane. Cars slowly drove past it, horns honking and passengers whooping, before driving off. The mecha occasionally saluted, to even louder cheers.

The customers at the truck stop could hear the rhythmic clanking noise from quite some distance away. As the mecha approached, most of them just stood and stared, their mouths gaping. The mecha walked into the parking lot, picked a row of interior pumps, and stood there, waiting. The loudspeaker flared again. ""Don't mind me, citizens. I just need fuel. I'll wait in line.""

The two truckers that were next in line made several animated arm gestures, then each got into their trucks, started them up, and moved to back up. The mecha backed up too, getting out of their way. Deftly, the trucks slithered past each side of the mecha, smoothly arriving back in their lanes. ""Thank you, citizens!"" the loudspeaker blared.

Slowly, the mecha lowered itself onto its hands and knees. From there, it shifted to a prone position, and began to army-crawl between the rows of gas pumps. The clanking and scraping made a ferocious noise that caused many onlookers to cover their ears. Finally, the mecha was in position, and the steady hum of its power shut down, leaving behind a ghostly silence.

A few moments passed. Then the sides of each limb opened up, and the pilots exited, lowering themselves gingerly to the ground. As the onlookers continued to gawk, the pilots nonchalantly pulled out their company credit cards, swiped them at the pumps, then each removed a gas cap and put the diesel spouts into the exposed fuel filler.

The trucker opposite Dwight stammered. ""Uh...er...um...what kind of mileage do you get in that thing?""

""I'm not sure,"" Dwight answered. ""We just burned about five hundred pounds; that got us a total of about fifteen miles. We used a lot less fuel during free-fall, though.""

""Free-fall?"" the trucker replied weakly. ""Buddy, you must have horseshoes in *both* pockets.""

A few families had crowded around Irwin. ""How do you become a giant-robot pilot?"" one kid asked.

""First, you have to invent it,"" Irwin answered. ""I'm part of the team that built this. We have two more back at our lab.""

""Do they fly too?"" The kid's eyes burned with adoration.

""Not yet, but after today, I'm sure we'll add it soon!"" The kid looked disappointed. Irwin continued. ""But...you know what they *can* do? Kung fu battle! Just like in the movies!"" The kid gaped wordlessly.

""What company do you work for?"" a man asked. ""Who is in the giant-robot business?""

""I'm with a research-and-development division of Unlimited Partners,"" Irwin answered. ""And we do a lot more than just giant robots.""

""Well, I'm sure glad you do!"" the man exulted. ""That was fine work, stopping that hijacking. Can you believe the government hasn't even released a statement on it? I think they're too humiliated.""

""I haven't had time to catch up on the news,"" Irwin explained. ""I'm sure I will...once I fly back to the office.""

""That's right, ladies — you *too* can become a giant-robot pilot!"" Stacy happily explained to a throng of Girl Scouts, hanging on her every word. ""And I don't just fly it; I helped *design* and *build* it! But you'll need to stay in school, study hard, and keep out of trouble! Jobs like these only go to the best! And *you* can make it this far, if you just apply yourselves!""

""We will!"" they cheered as they ran off to get back in their vans.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that,"" the den mother told Stacy.

""No problem, I get it,"" Stacy answered. ""I know the Girl Scouts are for at-risk children. Hopefully they stay inspired.""

The den mother glanced at the mecha, her eyes filled with wonder. ""If *that* doesn't inspire them...*nothing* will.""

A thin, gangly man in business-casual left the shop and approached Gary, a stunned look on his face. Gary turned and smiled. ""Are you the manager?"" He tried to answer, but couldn't find his voice; finally, he just nodded vigorously.

""What's the pre-authorization limit on these pumps?"" Gary asked nonchalantly.

""Uh...ummm...seventy five gallons,"" the manager stammered.

""Can we all get authorized for about a thousand gallons each? We have a long flight home.""

""I...um...yes. I'll...go do...that."" The manager walked off, looking behind him one last time before disappearing inside the shop.

As the mecha continued to fuel, Dwight walked up to Stacy. ""So...before the next time...*rubber shoes*.""

Stacy laughed. ""I know, right? I though the *flight* was bad...the walk was easily *twice* as bad! I think my bones are still shaking.""

""And rubber knee pads and elbow pads, too.""

""Yeah...I'm not looking forward to fixing all those scrapes. But can you imagine it? The mecha will look like a roller-derby player! How awesome would *that* be?"" Stacy looked at the mecha, grinning impishly. ""How about retractable inline skates? The *heck* with all this walking!""

""Oh yeah, huh?"" Dwight agreed. ""I guess there are some ideas that don't occur to you unless you try the thing in the real world."" Dwight looked at the mecha's back. ""And why the heck don't we have a giant flaming sword?""

The four pilots continued to field questions, and receive congratulations, as the pumps slowly filled up the mecha. Finally, they put the spouts back, replaced the gas caps, and climbed back inside their respective flight decks, giving the crowds one last thumb's up before disappearing inside, to the din of their hails and cheers.

The mecha powered up, its electric hum making the air shake. This brought on another round of applause and whooping. It slowly army-crawled from under the canopy, back to unobstructed space. The metallic screeching and scraping sound silenced the crowd quickly as they covered their ears and winced.

""*Oh* my God,"" Irwin began. ""I haven't dealt with so much of the public in my *life*!""

""I heard *that*!"" Stacy added. ""This was fun once, but if there are any more public appearances, I think we need to use gregarious pilot types. I thought the *battle* was tough...having to deal with people was *much* more draining!""

""Hey Gary, once we're out, can we launch with only three of the rockets?"" Dwight asked. ""I really want to try a salute as we leave.""

""I think that'll be safe,"" Gary answered. ""But don't try anything fancy. Just one salute and we're done.""

""Not a problem,"" Dwight laughed. ""I'm willing to start small.""

The mecha walked to the far end of the complex's parking lot, away from the people, trucks, and anything flammable. After turning to face the crowd, its leg rockets ignited, along with one arm. As the mecha launched into the sky, its free arm moved to salute, before dropping that arm down and firing the last rocket. The exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but the rockets made too much noise to hear them.

The flight back to their airport was uneventful and leisurely. There was no need to use full rocket power; all the pilots had had enough of high G forces for one day.

The mecha neared the airport. The exterior cameras showed that huge crowds had formed on either side of the runway. The radio suddenly crackled to life. ""Welcome back, robo-nauts!"" Eric Thompson's voice gushed. ""You're all heroes!""

""Oh, man,"" Gary answered. ""I hope you don't expect us to deal with any more people. All we want to do is collapse."" The mecha moved to land upright.

""Not a problem,"" Eric assured them. ""You just need to land and crawl back inside. We'll deal with the press.""

""Thanks, boss,"" Gary replied, with great relief in his voice. ""The truck stop was agonizing, but we didn't know what else to do."" The mecha landed gently on the ground; the exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but they couldn't be heard over the roar of the rockets.

""I understand completely,"" Eric commiserated. ""And rest assured, you all get the rest of the day off. Well, after a full medical exam. We want to make sure you're intact.""

The mecha got down on its hands and knees. ""So do we,"" Gary agreed. ""We're just glad to have survived.""

""So am I,"" Eric answered sanguinely. ""And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about the reaction. Lots of nonpublic stuff. You all did more good today than you can possibly imagine.""

The mecha crawled through the hangar door. ""That's fine...but *tomorrow*. We need a break.""

""You've earned it,"" Eric agreed. ""Have a good evening.""

The hangar door closed behind the mecha, the loud clang reverberating across the runway."
"I find it strange that RoboCop (1987) is not classified as cyberpunk when in fact, it's pure cyberpunk.A few days ago, RoboCop aired on TV, and i was struck with the fact that RoboCop is actually a really effective and true cyberpunk flick, and it accomplishes this without the need for neon. All the themes and none of the aesthetic.

Let me explain, some of the points of cyberpunk are:

- Most important one **High-tech Low-life**

- Cybernetic ehancements otherwise perfecting human life and/or replacing it

- Very dark and gritty, oftentimes very violent, often showcasing crime in the lowest levels of society.

- Takes place in the near future.

- Huge megacorporations are at the head of every police adnd military force and are behind the tech that exist in the world and are insanely corrput.

*RoboCop has it all, minus the neon.*

First of all, almost right off the bat the world around you is portrayed as grimy, violent, unfair, cruel and rarely are the normal walks of life shown, focusing on the machinations of the ambitious employees of a mega-corporations and of RoboCop and his dealings with the world of crime. So there we have the low-life showcased. This is very well portrayed in the gruelling violence. RoboCop doesn't fuck around. The first rating was an X-Rating, ehich was only reserved for movies with explicit sexual content, but they later turned it down.

The megacorporation is just as corrupt as everyone thinks they are. The underhanded deals, the competetiveness, the ties-in with both the Government and organised crime, the total lack of respect or consideration for human life.  Not to mention, they basicaly own Detroit.

The corporation in the movie OCP, basicaly owns every asset in Detroit, from the police department to even supplying the US military.

The high-tech part comes, obviously, from the extremely advanced technology in the field of prosthetics and cybernetic enhancements, int his case RoboCop get's his entire body (except for his head) changed with a robotic body. He has become a perfect being, an imitation of life, which is heavily cyberpunk.

It doesn't take place in the distant future, in fact, it takes place when the movie was made, making it to, contemporary audiences, somewhat more relatable.

There are also plenty of themes with how RoboCop deals with this fact, making it actually pretty tragic, which is perfect for Cyberpunk.

It has pretty much everything cyberpunk, with none of the look of cyberpunk."
"[Discussion][Meta] What IS cyberpunk?[UPDATE] Seriously, thank you all for sharing so much information, I love what you wrote. TIL, TIL, TIL. 

[Update2] The consensus seems to be ^(anything...however, primarily) ""High tech, Low Life"". That suits a general rule of thumb I'm satisfied with. 


I feel like it's the elephant in the room here on /r/Cyberpunk ... 

^(what qualifies?)

Sometimes I feel like the submitted pictures don't fit the theme, and other times I feel like anything that would fit inconspicuously into the background of a scene of *Bladerunner* will suffice. 

Now I'm not trying to start an argument, I want to give my two cents and try to get some clarification. 

I see ""Punk"" as rebellious, out of the norm, blatantly certain of  *itself* (so to speak). And I see ""Cyber"" as anything robotic or electronic that is self-aware,  flashy, or takes a large focus on custom futuristic design. 

The general ""punk"" theme (steampunk, cyberpunk, etc.) usually has to do with a common design. Something that relates an image to the overall theme. Often this has to do with a sort of rough-n-tumble lifestyle combined with their respective tech or appearance. 

Cyberpunk, to me, is about futuristic people or societies living their lives in a way we feel a standard resident of the future would live. Body augmentation, fascinating and unnecessary technology strewn about as if, in our eyes, it isn't the holy grail of ""cool shit"". 

""You're just some punk, living in 2542 by new-age rules.""

Anyway, I haven't slept in a while so maybe I'm not going anywhere specific with this, but what do *you* think cyberpunk means?

 ^(Your input is appreciated)"
"Cyberpunk short story: ""The Slow Reveal""I have the most beautiful dreams. That’s one of the perks of this job. The catch is I can’t tell anybody what they’re about. That would violate the NDA.

I got my interface put in at 18. A little later than most, but my family is poor. Even then I knew it was a spendy gift and wondered how dad managed it, but didn’t want to sour the occasion so I simply laughed and said I loved it. 

It isn’t a “real” neuroprosthetic, the serious hardware’s on the outside. I have to carry my slab around or I get no benefit from it. The silver lining is that this method saves me fedcoin by avoiding the need for surgery when I want to upgrade. 

Just to look at me you wouldn’t know I’d had any work done, since the interface talks to the slab wirelessly. I’m not superficial but I am conscious of appearances, and there’s no shortage of businesses that turn you away if you’ve got anything sticking out of your head. Security concerns.

The hidden cost of this gift became apparent when dad started forwarding me job applications for a render farm. The same one that did that popular recent kid’s film about the three toed sloth who steals a military exoskeleton. They also did most of the past decade’s films starring deceased, licensed historical celebrities until backlash on big name VR lobbies convinced them to go in a different direction. 

It really came out of left field. I’m not a movie guy. But as I read it all the way through it turned out all I’d have to do is sleep. As soon as REM sleep begins, my brain is networked with the other employees’ in a distributed computing setup and the next set of frames begins rendering, timed according to our averaged sleep cycles. Easy money.

I did a word search on the fine print. Sure enough they reserve the right to keep me under for up to twenty unpaid minutes if necessary to complete a set of frames. But beggars can’t be choosers. And I am confronted every day with relentless reminders that we are beggars. 

Residorms aren’t meant for whole families. They’re just one step up from a capsule hotel. Same manufacturer, slightly different market. Most of the people who live in these things just use them as a stepping stone to a real apartment after living on the streets. Then there are the NEETs. Some people don’t need anything more to be happy than an interface, a residorm and VR gaming. All their money goes into upgrading their slab. 

I remember flipping through an old album and seeing my dad holding an old timey slab up to his face. There was a 2D display on it. He said they used them primarily for telephony and controlled the other functions by touch. This was before neural interfaces were legalized, offloading the display to your visual cortex and the controls to your motor cortex. 

I jokingly asked if phones had knobs and dials before that. Turns out they did. I tried to picture people sitting complacently in their little pentagonal wooden shelters, wearing top hats and monocles, chatting over touch display phones with knobs and dials about foot-ball, petroleum taxes or whatever was important to people back then. 

At some point I realized I would have to cave in and take the position. Dad’s income isn’t enough. Mom teleoperates a service drone aboard a cruise blimp. Her employer sets people up to work from home, renting out their “general intelligence” to control service bots at whatever the going rate is that day. Licensing high end AI is costly and the fines for pirating it are ruinous. Paying the desperately poor a few fractions of a fedcoin per hour and getting human level intelligence for your robots in return is not too shabby. For the business owner.  

At least she can work from home. There just isn’t enough put away to fix the burst fluidic muscle column in her leg. I printed a bare bones substitute, it’s enough that she can hobble about to make dinner and whatnot but I wouldn’t want her trying to navigate the PRT network on that thing. I’ve seen enough candid video of strangers indifferently stepping over the wounded, too busy and too detached to help. 

Not if I could help it. The interview was done in under a minute. I received a notice two minutes later confirming I’d gotten the job. Most of what the interview for is to distract you while they probe for mental illness or dark triad personality disorders. *“By continuing to participate in this interview you consent to allow us access to your interface for screening purposes”* blah blah yes I consent. 

Privacy is another one of those old man words that dad won’t shut up about. As if he’s important enough for anybody to bother creeping on him. The over-abundance of microscopic cameras makes privacy a practical impossibility. They coat pretty much every surface outside of private dwellings. I’d be bothered if the footage weren’t public access. 

Really helps reduce the police workload when victims track down footage of the crime they want to report, crop it and send it in for review. If that’s too much of a hassle, must not have been a serious offense. That’s the reasoning, I think. 

My first night on the job was uneventful. Intro stuff mostly. I don’t know what I expected. When I woke up I remembered it dimly just like any other dream. It then rapidly faded over the next few minutes until I couldn’t recall any of it. I can make it stick if I try, but since I can’t talk about it anyway there’s little point.  

Spent my free time the way most boys my age do. Well, one of a few ways. Some people just want to eat, believe it or not. They go hungry most of the time irl, so in-sim, they gorge themselves with a stomach that never fills and hunger that is always sufficient to maximize the food’s appeal but which never becomes uncomfortable. 

Then there are people who want to kill and torture. That’ll put you on all kinds of Habsec watch lists, but they don’t care. No end of user content out there catering to those inclinations. Even I have one I use to blow off steam now and again. I think it’s just excessive use that’s unhealthy. 

But of course, loads of people only want to fuck gorgeous women all the time. Or men. Or human/animal hybrids. Or neotenized cartoon ponies, aliens, Japanese teenagers with neon hair and gigantic eyeballs, you name it.  

Videogame characters are popular. I’ve seen more meticulously rendered Pokemon genitalia than I ever wanted to. Then there’s dolphins, horses, and a variety of other animals. No actual animal, no crime although it’s still pretty fuckin’ weird in my book. I really wish I knew which sex sims people use so I could exercise some discrimination in who I associate with. 

There’s ways to find out. If someone pisses you off badly enough. You and some buddies can dig through his posting history, hack into his sim catalogue and find out what embarrassing shit he gets off to. Then spread that around and watch him disappear from the VR lobbies entirely. Total scrub of his online presence. It’s great fun unless you’re on the receiving end. 

I guess it’s somewhat hypocritical to shame the target for enjoying many of the exact same sims as the people doxxing him. But when you’re part of a mob, justifying yourself is the easiest thing in the world. VR Lobbies amount to a great teeming mass of novelty addicted maniacs, with an inexhaustible supply of brutal hostility. 

Usually that hostility is directionless, and while that’s the case it’s safe and highly entertaining. Provided you’re a nobody and haven’t made any enemies. Every so often, all of that anger will suddenly be focused on a single person and it absolutely shreds their life to pieces. 

The offense can be as minor as unpopular political opinions, contrarian views about a well liked television show or something similarly trivial. Dad says when he was my age, youthful follies were forgotten. Now, they are immortalized before a global audience. 

It is now precariously easy to slip up in a way that forever destroys your employment prospects and social life. With so little work needing humans to do it, employers can afford to narrow their search to people with totally clean records. And who doesn’t Google their date? 

The really surreal thing is to read the posts of the people doing the tormenting. While they’re the ones dishing it out, they see it as administering justice. The absolute worst is assumed of the target, every flaw is magnified, every good deed swept under the rug. His complaints about the suffering inflicted on him are roundly mocked as whining and exaggeration. 

But often, it’s turned around. One or more of the attackers become targets themselves. Then they change their tune entirely. Wailing about how miserable it is to be the punching bag of dozens, or hundreds. Villainizing those people for doing the *exact same thing* they were doing themselves to somebody else not so long ago. It really shines a light on the nature of human beings as primates whose social politics have always been predicated on ruthless group antagonism, petty gossip and violence. 

So I keep my head down. My opinion is always the same as that of the largest bully in the room. In that respect this job is perfect for me. Reduced exposure to humanity means reduced danger. I still leave the residorm from time to time. It’s part of a consolidated habitat, also zoned for shops, restaurants, hospitals, schools and just about everything else but electrical generation. So there’s loads to do, the air is always clean and there’s never any harsh weather as it’s all indoors. 

Outside is a different story. I haven’t set foot out there since I was ten. I don’t think my old gas mask would even fit me now. The sky was blue at some point, allegedly. I’ve only ever known it to be green. Methane hydrate and hydrogen sulfide released from the sea, long before I was born. 

The federally funded program to replace species wiped out by this has been going on for most of a century, rebuilding the ecosystem tier by tier with variants on those species modified for the new atmosphere. They’re up to small mammals now. Some of the new insects get really big. Creeps me the fuck out when they land on the windows. 

My last excursion was a field trip. They shuttled us all out into the humid, stinking jungle wearing matching coldsuits and gas masks. I remember this huge flying insect with four wings relentlessly colliding with the faceplate of my mask as I swatted at it. Never was much of a nature lover, even then. 

The movement I see is all inward now. Consolidation. Organization. Single structure cohabs outnumbered conventional cities as of about a decade ago. Way cheaper to heat and cool a single large structure than lots of small ones. Great for what’s left of the environment, too. The whole thing is easily walkable although there’s indoor PRT if you’re lazy, and no small number definitely are. That also accounts for the popularity of personal mobility devices.

I’ve got a little two wheeled PMD myself. You stand on two small platforms just big enough for your feet, there’s a vertically oriented block of battery between them which you grip with your knees, and a little self balancing wheel under each foot.

There’s nothing to indicate state of charge unless you ride it someplace out of range of the charging field, like anything else that runs on batteries. Come to think of it, I remember seeing a much larger, goofy looking version of this on the “retro media” VR lobby. 

Knowing Dad, he probably had one. I pictured him whizzing about on it, wearing a top hat and monocle, dialing a telephone number with his finger by pressing it against the 2D display of whatever passed for a slab at the time. I smiled, and a prismaview billboard I happened to be passing mistook it for interest in their product. 

I spent the next ten minutes emphatically arguing with the little sales agent that popped up in the center of my vision that I was not actually interested in trying speedfoam and did not know any friends or family who might be tragically unaware of the benefits of speedfoam. Clicking the box to opt out of any future ads just started a new argument.

"Elon Isle: A Post-Cyberpunk City-State [World-building Post]So I've been fleshing out one of my worlds lately, and I figured that I would create a general hub that I could use across multiple story series. Eventually, I want to open-source the place so more people than myself could write stories set there. If needbe, it's a good idea to read [**this**](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15957-malik-womacks-eutopia-series/).

Elon Isle is meant to be a corporation-state that's in the process of becoming Vyrdist, though there's still a long way to go. I always imagined it to be an overgrown Chicken McNugget, but when I sketched it out, it felt much more natural to add peninsulas, keys, bays, barrier islands, reaches, archipelagos, and deltas.

The nature of the island was inspired by video game sandboxes; particularly the difference between the likes of Saints Row 2 and Saints Row the Third and 4— that is, the difference between a fleshed out, living, landmark-infested world and a world that's so god-lifeless and bland that it's basically as stock as they come. I created Elon Isle as if was going to be a wide-open sandbox, so I wanted to come up with a gameworld that I would want to play in, one that I could come back to, one where I could play for years and always find new things as well as feel that I could always find new things. When I completed that goal, I then reimagined it as a real life location.

Continuing the video game influences, I also imagined it as being a little over half the size of *Just Cause 2's* Panau; roughly 210 square miles in size.

It was founded by a man named Yuli Baba (no relation) and his partner in crime, Hyun Ryu, two of the world's wealthiest men— president and CEO of Janvier Corporation respectively— who had intended on creating a sort of futurist theme park in the vein of Dubai. Yuli Baba founded the city of Elon, while Ryu created Van Norlon. They eventually grew to merge. Already existing on the island was the once quaint town of Duryset, which soon had an expansive college built within its borders. Elsewhere, there rose Babenshire and Falstead.

20 years ago, the Word of Vyrd spread outwards from Duryset's college, kickstarting a wave of techno-syndicalism known as [Vyrdism](/r/Vyrdism). Baba became infected by the Word, and betrayed Ryu to take control over Janvier Corporation. Ryu had already intended upon wresting control himself in order to create a corporatocratic fascist state on Elon Isle, but he had been outmaneuvered and was forced to fall back upon a few of his old allies part of another corporation, alphaDyne. Even worse for Ryu was the rise of a third corporation— Izumi Corp.— which was so thoroughly Vyrdist that it had actually made waves across the globe. 

Elon and Duryset became hotbeds of Vyrdism, which raised the standards of living for the underclass tremendously. Baba had intended on giving much of his wealth to charity, but opted against it, instead choosing to hand over various elements of Janvier to Izumi while also investing in Izumi. He recognized that Ryu and his cabal weren't going to give up so easily.

Janvier Corporation is the expy to Alphabet in that it was born in Silicon Valley and rose to prominence as a search engine. Its motto is also ""Never do wrong."" AlphaDyne (no relation to Alphabet) is styled more like Comcast and Koch Industries. 

Izumi is the freak misfit of Elon in that it's the expy of Mondragon Corporation— that is, a union/federation of worker cooperatives. It has the same problems that Mondragon has— worker-owners are of a slightly higher class than mere workers— but it's better than what came before. 

The construct of the island goes like this

Over-arching: Elon Isle. Formerly an earthy Chicken McNugget.

- Elon. The City-State of Elon keeps the 'futurist theme park' aspect that Baba and Ryu originally aimed at creating when they were still friends. It has multiple towns and cities within it, of course, including Van Norlon.

- Duryset. University town with only a few high-rises; it's the world capital of Vyrdism and thus a hotbed of student radicalism. It's also a hotbed of occultism.

- Babenshire. Smaller than Duryset, though it's still got a few charms itself.

- Falstead. A recreation of small-town Americana in the Atlanic, this sleepy town is virtually hidden within the sticks and is where those tired of Elon and Duryset retire to. It's a hotbed of paranormal activity (to be precise, it's the center of paranormal activity; Elon Isle as a whole is highly haunted). 

Elon being the island's biggest municipality, it has many smaller cities and towns within it. Downtown Elon, Sun City (an elevated district ala *Deus Ex's* Hengsha), Van Norlon, Neo-Shibuya, Tetrix, Danbury, Severn, Soho,  Belle Maison Violette, Kensworth, SXG, Satoshi Park (expy of NYC's Central Park), and a few more whose names are still up in the air.

Elon can best be described as a futurist theme park meets San Francisco. There are parts of the city that are located on hills, giving the place an almost Mediterranean-esque quality. The architectural theme of the city is 'neo-futurism' with an excessive influence from cyberpunk.

Baba and Ryu crafted Elon to be the new Dubai, taking everything that was cool about Dubai, Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Moscow, etc. and putting it all in one place. Many buildings are replicated in Elon, such as the Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab, Jeddah Tower, Oriental Pearl Tower, Taipei 101, Emerald Plaza, Ryugyong Hotel, London's Shard, the Montreal Biosphère, just about all of Moscow's business district's buildings, and a few others— on top of entirely new constructions. It's superfuturistic and proud of it. There's Sun City, a deck located on the 46th floor of the downtown district. A whole host of ultra-high-tech corporations exist in the city, including a boatload of robotics and artificial intelligence companies. There's a district called Neo-Shibuya, which was created as a shoutout to cyberpunk and is infested with neon lights and kanji symbols and is basically a Little Tokyo. It's a fun city, no doubt. In the center is the Trinity Starscraper, a 1.5 mile high building which houses the world's most powerful computer— and subsequently, the world's most powerful artificial intelligence.

The climate of Elon is identical to that of England— rain, rain, snow, sleet, rain, with hints of sunshine every so often.

The economy of Elon has been described by many as everything from 'techno-syndicalist' to 'post-capitalist' to even 'free market socialist', largely thanks to Izumi Corporation and their abundance of worker co-ops/technates. Aside from a State largely run by AI and featuring quite a bit of [helotism](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15249-helotism/) keeping the place looking nice, there's very little intervention in the economy. Yes, there's a basic income, but it's administrated purely through AI and is mostly derived from the helot class of droids. It's expected that you use your income to invest in droids of your own, but no one's telling you to do anything with it. All in all, Elon Isle's economy is more like a mixture between a free market economy, a cooperative economy, and a slave economy.

The government's still in flux right now. Most political power is held by an AI, an AI that was trained to hold as little power as possible. While Baba and most in Elon like this hands-off approach, there are elements throughout the island— from the Left and Right alike— that wish for there to be a much more authoritarian structure. Ryu is one of those, but he's not the only one; just one of the more Rightist elements. Some from Duryset, for example, aim for abolishing the free market and establishing a Dictatorship of the Proletariat, though they are rather splintered amongst themselves over whether two keep the [technostist](/r/Technostist) economy (that is, everything necessary is automated) or to go Luddite and bring back human labor.

While Elon is, indeed, a megacity, it's still just one part of Elon Isle. 

Duryset is the only other municipality that can be called a 'city', and it's borderline. it has a mixture between upscale neighborhoods and wards. There are a few low-level skyscrapers in the town. 

Babenshire is solidly a town, though it's somewhat lively for a town. Falstead, as aforementioned, was never meant to be anything more than nostalgic Americana.

Between these municipalities, there is the natural world.  It's peppered with human civilization, but you won't be disappointed if you're also looking for long stretches of pure nature. There is even a wildlife reserve in the middle of Elon— Kyu Park. Based heavily off New York City's ""Central Park"". Elsewhere, there are caves, caverns, hidden treasures, and various other little fun things. There's a mountain/dormant volcano, and two major rivers carving up the island. 

There are various conspiracies. ""Conspiracies"". Some are difficult to find. Deep within the sewers, you will find an entrance to a coordined-off ultra-tech base. There's an expansive cave system. There are hidden underground military bases in the forest and even the municipalities. There's a shortwave radio numbers station broadcasting. There's actually three— one broadcasting from Elon, one broadcasting from an underground base, and one broadcasting from low earth orbit.

There are Greco-Egyptian ruins hidden throughout the map. Why? Who knows...! 

There's quite an extensive woodlands on Elon Island, full of hills. You can find some loners out in the woods, as well as many animals and caves and other hidden goodies. And, of course, the dark things...
______________

One thing to get out of the way: I tossed it out at you before, but Elon Isle as a whole was long famous for being incredibly haunted, whether by ghosts, cryptids, or aliens.  There are ghost vehicles that you can find driving down rural roads. There are disappearing ghost planes and ghost drones. Even in the ultra-high tech metropolis of Elon, there are urban legends of strange entities, curses, and the like. There are many stories from the original locals and the earlier natives about strange beasts lurking in the forests— some being hairy apes; others being clawed lizardmen; a few even telling of a man that looks like a moth.... It's also a UFO hot spot, with a high number of unidentifiable craft appearing in the skies every year. Considering that Elon has so many drones in the sky— including passenger drones, private drones, and helot drones— it's actually rather freaky that there are so many UFOs.

While you can find the paranormal just about anywhere on the island, the epicenter is undoubtedly Falstead. It actually celebrates the paranormal every year. Falstead has always been a small town, a kind of place where it feels like everyone knows each other and the line between the woods and the edge of town are fuzzy. So when you feel like you're being watched all the time, you can know it's not by Big Brother, or any human, or AI...

_________________

Well, that's the gist so far. There's still a lotta work to be done. Whaddya think?

As I said quite a bit early in the post, it's an open-source story location that can best be described as 'eutopian'— generally a good place, generally improving, but that's not to say things can quickly reverse course. 

To keep with the video game inspiration, I even thought of 4 ""expansion packs"" (I'd guess they'd be called DLC, but most DLC nowadays is just content that was cut from the main game, so I refuse to call it this)

- Black Saturday Elon Isle: Atomicpunk Edition, which is where nuclear war breaks out and the island is hit by a few megatons. It's ultra-depressing, with electric death everywhere, burning remnants of a now dead civilization.

- '84 Elon Isle: Cyberpunk Edition, which is where Ryu managed to take control from the start and Baba was the one who was ousted, turning Elon Isle into a classic cyberpunk dystopia.

- '84 Elon Isle: Sovietpunk Edition, where one of the Marxists from Duryset managed to take control of the island.

- '84 Elon Isle: Nazipunk Edition, which is actually set in an alternate timeline where the island is occupied by Nazis. Basically 'sovietpunk' but with extreme eugenics and 'causting the undesirables rather than proletarian vengeance against the corporate elite and violent class warfare.


Of course, those are just expansions; for me, the basic island is meant for futuristic realist/slice of tomorrow stories."
"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers. 

******************

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

Complexity is not difficulty, but mess, toxic waste, genre
disorder. Unlike the docile creature modernist science
demands, base matter twitches and spits, selfassembling
neoverminous swarms . It bites, and spreads disease. Tur·
bular moan of digitally irresolvable recyclones. Telecom­
mercial contagions pulse through cybergothic switching
systems. Faceless horror.
Supraterrestrial - ' solar' or 'general' - economic s

Cooking-through the frozen security codes you dis­
cover that the universe is an iceberg tip jutting out of

strange things can occur, emerging upon a novum terrain
of indeterministic, irreversible, and auto-delinearizing
processes . Open-systems or partial individuals. Cross
behaviorial thresholds which switch them into dissipators
sifting matter-energy flows to select against noise and
engender local complexification, increasing heterogeneity,
production surplus differentiating excrement. Such silt­
ings of machinically disposable disequilibrium are imma­
nently tensed against base-current, machine-efficiency
=degree-zero, body without organs . Life is a problem in
search of a solution, added to protobiotic matter as a
plane of variation, a continuous falling, auto-escalating
over-production crisis from the start.

shackled to the historical temporality of inheritance, obli­

"I'm the author of a few highly successful /r/nosleep stories. This week, instead of writing something scary, I wrote a cyberpunk short story! I hope you all enjoy it!“Looks like the Reavers are hitting the docks again,” Juno said, watching the area through binoculars.  “Our path to the lower levels should be clear.”

I sat on the edge of the rooftop overlooking the south end of the city, the rain falling in heavy sheets around me.  Water dripped off my nose, but I didn’t move, concentrating my attention towards the docks.  I didn’t have Juno’s binoculars, but my contacts let me zoom far enough to see that she was right.  A swarm of Reavers flew towards the shantytown that lay next to the river, looking like metallic squids arcing through the sky.  They flashed with lights, and, even though I couldn’t see it, I knew they were marked with a lightning logo.  Raikage industries.  

I sniffed at the air.  “Well, at least it’s raining pretty hard,” I said.  “That might interfere with their sensors.  Maybe they’ll only manage to grab a few dozen people this time.”

Juno scoffed.  “They never grab that few.” She stuffed her binoculars into her bag and turned her face up towards the rain.

Juno was in her late twenties, and had been making her living on the wrong side of the law for at least a decade.  Her hair was pulled tight into a ponytail, revealing a tattoo on the side of her neck.  The tattoo was of a angel wings, the symbol that marked her as a Courier.

She opened her eyes and caught me staring at the tattoo.  “You like what you see kid?”

I tore my eyes away and looked back over the city, the neon lights hazy in the rain.  “No.  Well, yes, I mean…” 

Juno snorted.  “Take it easy Leo, I’m just giving you a hard time.  Give it another six months with me, and you’ll be ready to join the Couriers.  That’s a promise.”  

I shot her a look, raising my eyebrows in surprise.  “Really?” I asked.  “So soon?”

Her serious expression was broken by the barest ghost of a smile.  “We’ll see.”  Her face regained its rock hard discipline.  “For now, we have an appointment to keep.”  

I hopped up to my feet and threw my backpack over my shoulder.  I was surprised how familiar the weight of it had become.  I’d only been training with Juno for a year, but my past life was little more than a hazy memory, something that happened to someone else.  

An image rose to my mind, of a warm bed and the smell of hot dinner.  I pushed it away.  Remembering was useless.  All those things happened to a different Leo, and he wasn’t the same person I was.  Not anymore.  Those memories didn’t even feel real.

Not like this.  Not like the feeling of pavement beneath my feet and the cold sting of the rain down my back.  I hurried after Juno down the stairs that led down to the street, pulling up my jacket’s hood to shield my face.  Crowds of people filled the streets, bumping and pushing as they made their way through the chilly night air.

Juno led the way, cutting through the crowd like water.  I marveled at her; she had mastered the art of moving quickly while remaining unnoticed.  I trailed a dozen feet behind, doing my best to follow the techniques she’d taught me.  

We had made it a few blocks when I heard it.  A low buzzing sound, coming from above.  A Reaver dropped into the street ahead of us.  It looked like a giant luminescent squid, flashing its lights into the crowd.  My stomach dropped, and my instincts screamed at me to look for an alleyway to duck into.  But no, I was more experienced than that.  I forced the look of annoyance onto my face that Juno had drilled into me.  They’d be scanning the crowd for signs of fear.  

A hologram was projected from the Reaver, and Robert Henderson, the CEO of Raiko industries appeared.  He was sitting in an armchair, and had a kind expression on his face.  

“Hello citizens of Pittsburgh,” he began.  “As CEO of Raikage Incorporated, it is has been my privilege to serve the members of this city.  We here at Raikage Incorporated have exciting plans to announce in the near future, plans that involve everything from police force reforms, to information about rising electricity costs.”

Henderson stood up and began to pace, and the hologram followed him as he walked.  “But I’d like to respond to a letter that I received from a concerned citizen.”  He picked up an actual physical letter from a desk, and only my fear and training stopped me from scoffing out loud at the absurdity of it.  

Juno was nowhere to be seen.  Good I thought.  At least we won’t both be caught if they process this crowd.  

“Dear Mr Henderson,” he continued with the letter.  “I am concerned with what your relocation drones are doing to the poorer members of our society.  I’ve been hearing so much about Raikage’s relocation program, and I just hope that we’re not doing more harm than good.  Sincerely, Deborah.”

Henderson shot a reassuring grin at the camera.  “Deborah, thank you for writing.  I’d like to assure you that our relocation drones take the utmost care in transporting those...more unfortunate members of society.”  He shrugged.  “But we also must remember that these people are living in crime, disease, and filth.  It is Raikage Incorporated’s responsibility as caretakers of Pittsburgh to ensure the safety of all, even if it means the discomfort of the few.” 

This was the third time I’d heard this speech.  If the Reaver’s facial recognition software had detected enough suspicious activity, it might mean they’d stop the crowd and process each one of us individually.  I held my breath.  

Henderson clapped his hands, and nodded.  “Great!  Just remember citizens, we are making progress!”

I sighed.  That, was the sign that we’d passed.  The Reaver lifted up off the ground and flew away, and the crowd began moving again.  When I blinked, the back of my eyelid was a dull green, a sign that a message was waiting.  I flicked my eye to the top right twice, and it appeared in my right contact lens.  

“Go home, no meeting tonight.  That was too close. -J”

I sighed, but sent back a message with one period that meant I acknowledged the order.  

I made my way through the city until I reached an older part of the city.  Factories loomed around, most shuttered and abandoned.  The street was nearly empty except for what I assumed were some drug dealers on a street corner far in front of me.  

I ducked into an alleyway that cut between two factories, and looked directly into the corner of a specific brick.  A soft hiss rang out, and a pile of trash down the alleyway moved as one piece, uncovering a manhole.  I flipped it up, and slid down the ladder that led into the hideaway.  

I breathed a sigh of relief when the trash slid over the entrance.  Raikage Incorporated still hadn’t ever found a Courier hideout since they took over Pittsburgh, though not for lack of trying.  

I walked down a corridor, passing a half dozen rooms until I reached one that said “Leo”.  I rapped my knuckles on it, and finally relaxed when Anna pushed open the door.  

“You made it back!” She squealed and jumped up to give me a hug.  I was glad to see her smile.  She hadn’t taken our parent’s death well, and I’d missed her laugh.  

“Hey squirt, you learn anything today?”  I asked, messing up her hair.  

“Don’t call me squirt,” Anna said, pouting.  Then a grin broke out on her face again.  “But yes.  Did you know that whales eat half a million calories in a single mouthful?”  

“Oh yeah?” I asked.  “We should get a whale to share some with us then.”  

Anna pouted at me.  “C’mon Leo, don’t be so down. Things are great!” 

I shook my head and threw my backpack onto the floor of the room.  “You’re right,” I said. “But it’s my job to worry about things now.”   

Anna shrugged and jumped onto her bed, pulling out her new phone and tapping away at some game. 

Our apartment was small, consisting of two rooms: a bedroom with bunk beds and a desk, and a cramped bathroom.  The walls were made of metal, and it was lit up by some white LED’s we’d installed.  

I walked to the sink and pulled out my contacts, setting them in their electrical solution to recharge.  The world immediately grew less vivid and detailed.  Not blurry, just more real.  Contacts used information they gathered to tell you information that wasn’t visible to the naked eye.  They also gave me access to communication, and information on my surroundings.  But after a day of being bombarded by the information, I needed a break. 

Once my contacts were in place in the solution, I pulled out a rag and rubbed my eyes, trying to clear them of the electro-fluid that protected and powered my contacts. 

Anna was laying on her bottom bunk, her feet waving in the air while staring at her phone.  The wall beside her was plastered with stickers of sea creatures.  A huge Megalodon was stuck on the wall next to her pillow.  

She was 8 years old.  Our parent’s accident had been almost a year and a half back, and she finally seemed happy again.  I looked around at the apartment we lived in.  It was small, sure.  But it was comfortable, climate controlled, and above all, safe from the Reavers.  It would be worth millions on the black market, and here the Couriers were just letting us stay here at no cost.

I sighed and rubbed my forehead.  I already knew that there was no such thing as a free lunch.  At some point, I’d pay the price.  When the time came, I’d become a Courier, and have to take their contracts.  The Couriers were the premiere black market “service” provider in Pittsburgh, and working against Raikage Incorporated was dangerous at best.  

Anna hummed to herself as she tapped away at her game.  I’d do whatever it took to keep her here, safe.  I’d do what the Couriers wanted.    

A knock came from the door, and I jumped at the noise.  I checked the viewscreen and saw Juno standing in front of it, dripping wet.  I pulled it open and let her in.  

“Juno!” Anna said. “Did you bring me anything?”  

“Don’t I always?,” Juno said.  She reached into a pocket and pulled out a stuffed animal shark.  

Anna shrieked in joy and ran at her, giving Juno a hug and taking the toy.  “Thank you thank you thank you!”

 Juno’s normally stoic expression broke into an actual grin.  I stared at it in amazement.  

She looked over at me and nodded her head back out in the hall.  “C’mon kid, we’ve got a package we need to pick up for tomorrow.”  Her eyes watched mine.  “You took out your contacts.  They’re designed to only need recharging once a week.  Why?”

I stared at the ground.  “They’re too much sometimes.  And they make me feel like I’m a kid playing the part of a Courier.  That I should be ready to die at any moment for the cause.”  I grimaced, knowing how bad that sounded.  “But I know that’s what I’m working towards.  Should I put them back in?”  

Juno stared at me, nodding to herself. “You should get in the habit of only taking them out for recharge, but I’m not planning on going far.  It’ll be good training for if you lose them.”  

“I’ll be back in a minute,” I said to Anna.  

Anna nodded and jumped onto her bed, still playing with the shark.

Juno and I made our way out of the bunker and out into the night.  The rain still came down in sheets, but the street was lit up by the flashing advertisements that flew overhead.  The night was alive with light and sound, though none of it came from people.  We walked through the industrial district, making ourselves as inconspicuous as possible.  

“We’re meeting with an old friend of mine,” Juno said.  “He’s worked inside Raikage Incorporated for something like 25 years, but he hates them just as much as we do.  He requested a meeting with me an hour ago.”  

Juno led us into an abandoned factory, and held a door open for me.  I walked inside, feeling the familiar anxiety that alway came before a meeting with clients or other Couriers.  

A man stood inside facing away from the door.  He wore a trench coat, and stood with a hand behind his back.  

“Dionysus,” Juno said.  “It’s good to see you again.”

Dionysus turned around.  The left half of his face was composed entirely of robotic parts.  I spotted an artificial eye and ear, and shivered involuntarily.  

“I wish I could say the same my dear,” he said, speaking with a synthesizer.  “I’m afraid they found me out.”  

Juno jumped back when she saw his face, and I saw her hand casually reach down towards the stunner she kept inside her jacket.

“You’d be dead if they found you out,” she said.  “What do you want?”

The left side of his face twitched in a spasm.  “I want nothing but to die, but that peace has been taken from me.”  Moving faster than my contactless eye could track, he lifted his arm and fired towards us, hitting Juno in the lower leg.  

Juno fell to the ground with a scream of pain.  Dionysus’ arm hissed steam, then closed.  He aimed it towards her again, but his face twisted in agony.  “I’m sorry!” he called out.  “I can’t control what I’m…”

He was hit in the head by Juno’s stunner.  It knocked him to the floor where he lay twitching violently.  

Juno cursed from where she lay on the ground.  “Leo!” she called out.  

I ran up to her.  The blast from Dionysus had done some serious damage to her left calf, and blood dripped from the wound, soaking into the factory floor.  I knelt down and started to put pressure when Juno hit me on the head with her stunner.  

“No you moron, take this and go shoot him a dozen times.  It’s set to kill.”

She shoved it into my hands and applied pressure to her own leg.  I looked down at the stunner in my hand.  It was my first time holding a gun.  

“Now you moron,” she said.  “That hit won’t keep him down forever.”

The old Leo who ate with his family might’ve been sick with the situation.  The old Leo who played chess with his father might’ve cried, or begged for another way.  I on the other hand, felt nothing.  I walked over to the still twitching body of the man and fired at his head and arm until they were unrecognizable.  

I walked back to Juno and helped her tie up her leg.  She looked over at Dionysus and spat on the ground.  “Poor fool,” she said. “He fought against it till the end.  His type don’t just ‘miss’ and accidentally hit a person’s leg.”  

I went to hand her the stunner, but she pushed it away.  “Keep it.  My leg is stable, but you need to run back to the hideout and bring people to help carry me there.”

I nodded, stuffed the gun into my back waistband, and headed out into the rain.  I moved quickly, and after a few minutes turned the corner that lead towards the hideout.  I was so preoccupied with getting there that I hadn’t noticed the buzzing.  

Four reavers sat on top of the alleyway, hacking at metal and concrete with their arms.  They reached their tentacles down into the bunker and ripped out Couriers one by one, shoving them into the holding bays through where a squid’s mouth would be.  I held my hand over my mouth and ducked back around the corner.  

Then I heard the sound I’d been dreading.  A young girl’s shriek of fear.  I looked back around the corner and saw Anna lifted by a claw and stuffed into a hold.  She was holding a stuffed shark in her arms.  

A long minute passed as one of the Reavers stuffed its arm inside the hideout, rooting around the bunker.  It finally retracted, and the four Reavers flew off into the night.  They’d be heading out of the city, I didn’t know where.  No one knew where they took the “relocated” people.  I walked up to the hideout then looked up to watch their lights disappear into the night sky.  I pulled out the stunner to fire at them, but they were already far out of range.  

On autopilot, I walked into the broken remains of the hideout.  The Reavers had made deep gouges in the steel of the hallways, and had torn the doors from their hinges.  I walked into what remained of my room, and saw the shattered and twisted metal of the desk and bed.  

The bathroom was relatively untouched however.   My contacts were still on the bathroom counter.  I picked them up, and walked outside.  The rain came down hard, thunderous and loud.  I slipped one contact on, then the other, and the night came alive with information and light.  

My tears mixed with the electro fluid, and I felt a fierce determination rise up in me.  I was going to find Anna, and if they had done *anything* to her, I was going to kill every member of Raikage Incorporated.  
"
"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

"[Essay] What is Cyberpunk?\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.

&#x200B;

[One of the classics of the genre.](https://preview.redd.it/rnd5284piw4a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20a7841441baf13c7eeaab29c500b77e162b193d)

WHAT IS CYBERPUNK?

By. C.T. Phipps

Link: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)

When embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.

I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.

Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \*\*\*\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.



The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Blade Runner. Blade Runner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where the majority of work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). The majority of people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggarauts which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson’s works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the mportance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about.

A lot of fans of the genre love the tropes without actually caring about the meaning. Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trenchcoats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society.

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishsized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity’s problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.

I’ve mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may actually achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter.

Some cyberpunk works actually allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it’s not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Deckard, the protagonist of Blade Runner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet.

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the most deft of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop’s Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world–forcing them to rebel because society won’t allow them to be good.

The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.

Paul Verhoven’s Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit’s population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than “normal” criminals could ever hope to match.

OCP’s not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they’re actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science- fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.

While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class–so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality.

The Watch Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia.

So what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them."
"[Books] Ten Recommended Indie Cyberpunk Novels[https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2022/09/ten-indie-cyberpunk-novel.html](https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2022/09/ten-indie-cyberpunk-novel.html)

Cyberpunk as a genre arguably hit its heyday during the Eighties as a cultural force with Neuromancer and reached its zentih in social acceptance in the Nineties with The Matrix movies. After that, it slowly tapered off and ceased to be something fans got hyped over barring a few high profile video games. This is due to my suspicion that cyberpunk slowly became reality, or at least so similar to our current era of big corporations and hacker criminals that it stopped becoming genre fiction.

There have been a few major successes since then, literature-speaking, though as well as some genuine artistic achievements. Altered Carbon is one fo the strongest entries into this series due to Richard K. Morgan reinventing the darkness and anger of the original works for the Twenty FIrst Century. However, there's not nearly as many peers to it as there should be and the big corporate produced cyberpunk novels are not what I'm here to discuss.

No, I'm here to discuss indie produced cyberpunk novels that have caught my eye over the past decade and ones that I think are worth reccommending. As a cyberpunk author myself with the Agent G and Cyber Dragons trilogies, I thought I'd share ten novels that I really enjoyed set in the cyberpunk genre.

What is cyberpunk? For the purposes of this list, I'm going to define it as gritty near-future science fiction with an anti-authoritarian bent. For me, you can't claim the title of ""punk"" unless you have the latter, which is why The Matrix qualifies even if it's in the far future. You're welcome to disagree with the definition but that should let you know what I'm recommending down here.

**10.** ***You Can Be a Cyborg When You're Older*** **by Richard Roberts**

I'm already shooting myself in the foot by making  this my first entry but this is a Young Adult novel cyberpunk parody by the author of the Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain series. Vanity Rose is a fourteen year old with dreams of being a street criminal in an orphanage of children being raised by a malfunctioning robot. It's a wild and bizarre world where a good chunk of the population has joined a transhumanist cult where you spend all your money transforming yourself into World of Warcraft characters.

**9.** ***Ten Sigma*** **by A.W. Wang**

Ten Sigma is an interesting story with the premise of a dying woman signing her consciousness over to the US government to be horrifically brutalized and reprogrammed into becoming a killing machine they will unleash after the imminent collapse of society. This is a fascinating story because it almost entirely takes place in a virtual battlefield and is all about the dehumanizing effect of the training as well as the goal to eliminate every bit of humanity from the woman inside. You know, fun stuff like that. I liked it but it's a harsh read and the opposite of 10.

**8.** ***The Blind Spot*** **by Michael Robertson**

In the future, the majority of humanity has relocated to city-states in the middle of large wastelands and farms. One city is divided into the corporate-run have's while the have-nots actually have done pretty well for themselves by keeping a monopoly on vice as well as transhumanist technologies. However, the careful truce between the two sides is disrupted when someone starts framing the latter for terrorist activities against the former. Unless it's not a frame job at all. Our badass cyber-heroine and a very bland corporate douche must find out.

**7.** ***The Machine Killer*** **by D.L. Young**

A former hacker turned corporate shill works with a professional bodyguard for one last job to clear their debts with a famous computer corporation. No points for guessing that it goes completely sideways. The Machine Killer is a fun and entertaining book with a lighter side of cyberpunk criminal activity as well as likable protagonists. AIs, cybernetic cults, and more. It feels like a very well-written video game.

**6.** ***Mercury's Son*** **by Luke Hindmarsh**

The world's environment has been destroyed by a combination of war as well as mismanagement. Unfortunately, this has led to the rise of a brutal eco-friendly anti-technology theocracy that uses slave labor to clean up the environment while living in the cities under their control. Because they're enormous hypocrites, they also employ a cyborg investigator and scientists to keep themselves in power. I very much enjoyed this very interesting one-shot novel about a well-developed dystopian world.

**5.**  ***To Beat the Devil*** **by MK Gibson**

Cyberpunk and fantasy have been two things combined since Shadow Run. It's something that can work very well if done right and very poorly if done wrong. MK Gibson does it the right way with his oddball premise of the Biblical Armageddon happening and God not showing up. Demons now rule the Earth with humans having only one advantage: technology. Salem is a nanotech cyborg courier who gets caught up in the setting's bizarre politics.

**4.** ***Ghosts of Tomorrow*** **by Michael R. Fletcher**

Ghost of Tomorrow is one of my all time favorite cyberpunk novels and is my favorite Michael R. Fletcher novel. In the future, scans are the most important commodity in the world but the only way to make them destroys the brain they're taken from. This has led to a horrific trade in children and other people that our heroes are trying to shut down. There's also a cyborg ninja-cowboy that is hunting them. It is fun, dark, comedic, and weird. I can't wait for the sequel.

**3.** ***The Immorality Clause*** **by Brian Parker**

The Immorality Clause is a genre throwback that works exceptionally well. There's plenty of private detective cyberpunk novels out there but few that are actually done well. Here, Zach Forrest is a cop in New Orleans circa 2066. Easytown is what they call the cybernetic Red Light District with its perfectly like-like sex dolls and virtual reality fantasies. A murder gets Zach drawn in but he soon finds himself involved with a machine that is too human to be real. I really enjoyed it and read the entire series in one go.

**2.** ***Bubbles in Space: Tropical Punch*** **by S.C. Jensen**

As mentioned, there's a lot of cyberpunk detective novels. However, are there many cyberpunk detective novels where the protagonist is objectively terrible at her job and has an AI sobriety pig named Hammett? Bubbles in Paradise is a ridiculous affectionate parody of cyberpunk tropes that, nevertheless, works as a serious story. Tropical Punch is a great introduction to Bubbles Marlowe and she's an amazing character with a great combination of the ridiculous with the surprisingly poignant (as she's a recovering alcoholic trying to get her life back together).

**1.** ***Behind Blue Eyes*** **by Anna Mocikat**

Behind Blue Eyes is one of the best cyberpunk action thrillers I've ever read. Nephilim is a cybernetically enhanced assassin who has a job to execute any person who leaves the Olympias Corporations arcologies. She and her fellow Guardian Angels are all brainwashed but an EMP results in her getting back her free will--but how long can she keep it? And does she really want it when all the choices lead to nothing but death? Really well-written and I'm continuing to follow the story.

Honorable Mentions: The Finder at the Lucky Devil by Megan Mackie (urban fantasy cyberpunk), Neon Leviathan by T.R. Napper (cyberpunk anthology), Prime Suspects: A Clone Detective Story by Jim Bernehimer, and Psychodrome by Simon Hawke (reprinted formerly traditionally published cyberpunk)"
"Tech/cyber as a subculture...? / guilty about being interested in techwearAnd I specifically do not use the word cyberpunk because, personally, I do not see myself as a punk/anarchist; and by definition, cyberpunk is a subset of punk culture. Just with computers and complex DIY and hacking and stuff like that (and if you are a punk/anarchist, then that's completely fine by me. mad love to u).

And more specifically, it's hard to look at trends in culture such as techwear and not misdefine it as a subculture. Honestly, I wouldn't consider techwear, or any other cyber/cyberpunk-related thing floating around these days, to be a subculture; and that's coming from someone who has a love and admiration of the fashion trend. For something to be a subculture would be to suggest there is a certain style to how someone looks, yes, but also to someone's habits, their interests and what they favor in being patrons to, and the places they go for fun or where they meet and hang out with their friends. Nowadays, with the advent of the internet, what people back in the day would define as a subculture is, for all intents and purposes, objectively dead. I'm guilty of this too, as I'm interested in many different things and interests that would take up someone's entire lifetime 50 years ago.

To make things shorter, because there are already plenty of fantastic videos discussing the rise and fall of pre-internet subculture (check out [these](https://youtu.be/C5ye2qRHCyw) [two](https://youtu.be/dwMNyig6FJ8?list=TLPQMjcwODIwMjIhTdw4w01gCQ)) - In my opinion, what's holding back cultures like techwear, or anyone interested in science fiction and futurism (robotics, cyberpunk, computer science, etc.) is that we're maturing in a specific condition where our interests and expression styles are available to potentially tens of thousands of people at one specific time; in every way, absolutely killing this subculture of ever being underground or ""against the man"" or what have you. We've, ironically, had our interests swallowed up by capitalism, and with the rise of something like techwear, had this notion pushed to us that to look futuristic/cyberpunk is to buy from these boutique fashion labels that print Japanese lettering on jackets with 9K+ pockets. The part I feel guilty about is that I want to dress like I'm from the future. I want express myself in that sort of way, and enhance myself with gadgets and apparel, and things that can genuinely improve my life. But then, that would just make me a slave to the capitalist machine, right?

So then, by definition, what I'm interested in being cannot be called cyber*punk.* SO THEN WHAT THE HELL AM I???

And even then, being involved in something we would consider culture would, as I said before, require being in particular places or being a part of particular events or movements. In my perspective, I feel like our sort of 'sci-fi futurist' interests don't really have anywhere to go or ways we agree on what something is whatever subset of genre it is. Sci-fi has always been grouped with things like fantasy and superheroes when there is so much more to what it is in its own unique ways. I want to express myself to reflect my personality. The way I perceive things and my main interests. And I know this definitely sounds dumb with my current fashion plan, but I want to change my wardrobe to make a statement as well; to wordlessly inform someone of the dangers of an interdigital hauntological reality and where we may be headed as a society. And I want to achieve this... by buying a bunch of expensive clothes that look like cosplay. Sounds really dumb.

And to admit, I don't have any interest of becoming a fashion designer or garnering the skill to craft my own clothes, and crafting my own gadgets sounds next to impossible. I know I said the internet deluded the concept of subculture forever, but also not just the internet, but advents like online shopping allow us to recreate half a dozen lifetimes of expertise of some particular craft, in just 1 to 2 weeks of delivery. I know I already said I don't identify with being a punk, but I still feel tons of guilt of dedicating to some particular style of being that doesn't exist; like I'm just chasing a capitalist fad.

I know there are plenty of choices I can make to help out people and donate and help my local communities too, and yes, I absolutely want to do those things too, but being involved in this is not like being a goth, or being a punk, or being a jock, or whatever the fuck; because those communities all have their own rules and codes of living and events galore that people identify with and make lifelong friends in. No one can even agree on what the fuck being 'cyber' or 'tech-y' is because it literally hasn't been conceived into a genuine subculture. Sure, I have lots of respect for punks and goths, and I'm in some ways influenced by goths, but I have never ever fully identified with any of those camps. I've always been hugely interested in futurism, tech-centered dystopias, and computer stuff in general. And at the end of the day, I just feel confused and isolated; in a sort of grey area, wondering ""Am I just a fanboy, or am I part of some semblance of a subculture?"" Now I just feel depressed, so if you read this whole thing, thanks for reading this rant/discussion/thing... pretty much. I love you, and I hope you have a beautiful life <3."
"‘Love, Death, and Robots’ creatives’ review [major spoiler free]Netflix’s anthology of bite-sized sci-fi is a mixed bag in every sense of the word. As a writer and gamemaster, I approach movies from a perspective that’s not well represented in the review community. So, here is my review of the anthology.

The Good: The Witness, Helping Hand, Zima Blue

The Fun: Suits, When the Yoghurt Took Over, Fish Night

The Pointless: Shape-Shifters, Blindspot, Secret War


1. Sonnie’s Edge. A character portrait that suffers only from a short run time. It’s 50/50 show and tell, but there are signs that the telly bits are an artefact of the run time, not the writers (Peter F. Hamilton and Philip Gelatt).

The world building is excellent and entirely shown. The income gap, technology level, and social standing of the characters all come to you through visual cues. 90% of the dialogue is explaining protagonist Sonnie in some way.

The ending delivers a satisfying conclusion to a conflict you only realize was there in hindsight.


2. Three Robots. A comic piece in the “oh, archaeologists” vein. There’s some mildly poignant, if uninspired insight into our culture leading up to an excellent final punchline.

Also screenwritten by Philip Gelatt, it’s structurally similar to ‘Sonnie’s Edge’ and is all the better for it. However, it could have dug deeper into the social insight or humor or both. Very watchable, if not especially memorable.


3. The Witness. From a pure story perspective, this is a strong contender for best of breed. The characters are minimal, yet their motivations are exactly as clear as they need to be to drive a genuinely exciting chase plot.

The sex club scene didn’t need to happen in a sex club, but it’s also not completely gratuitous. When the protagonist witnesses a crime, the police prove useless, and she seeks help from her gangster boss. It builds the world—though in ways which have no pay off—but mostly informs motivations while facilitating the chase. If her boss wasn’t a gangster, she wouldn’t have gone to work. The story needs her to go to work for the chase to continue.


4. Suits. This one feels most like a back foot pilot and I would watch the hell out of the series. The world is well built for the short run time. The dialogue never sounds expositional. And there’s some real heart in there.

By the end, you have a very clear idea of who these people are, what they’re struggling with, and why. That said, it feels like a pilot, a prologue; not a stand-alone story.

Also, I have serious questions about their cow logistics.


5. Sucker of Souls. This is the first stumble of the bunch. The tone and the style don’t entirely mesh and the first few minutes are jarring because of it. Tonally, it’s very similar to ‘Suits’, but the latter’s genuine affection for the characters has been swapped out for the gleeful disregard you find in most horror movies. Once you figure out the tone, it’s good, spooky fun.

That said, it too feels like a prologue. A conflict is presented and resolved, but the resolution is unconnected to the part of the conflict we’ve seen. It’s not a deus ex machina, the way it ends makes perfect sense, but it’s too peripheral to feel like a conclusion.


6. When the yoghurt took over. What starts as a goofy nothing of an idea, quickly shifts into a solid parody and ends with legitimate gut punch. Structurally, it reminded me of many Neil Gaiman short stories where a frivolous-but-neat idea—like a cat that’s actually an angel—makes you question your entire lifestyle with a single, closing sentence.

Also, the weirdest nudity in the entire collection. Feature or flaw? You decide.


7. Beyond the Aquila Rift. In a collection that goes out of its way to be sexy, this one wins Most Erotic. It’s also the most reminiscent of spiritual forefather ‘The Outer Limits’.

The concept is engaging, though familiar, and it doesn’t push itself too far. Part of that is the run time limit, but also the story being true to the characters. The fact that we’re left with very little in the way of explanation is in line with the show’s pedigree; but that sci-fi anthology pedigree is the only thing that keeps the extended sex scene from feeling like the rest of the story was just there as a framing device.

On the one hand, it’s an excellent example of erotic sci-fi—nothing about it is forced (in either of the applicable uses of the word)—but it’s not an example most of us can follow. If you’re going to dedicate 15% of your story to a full-on sex scene, it better matter to the story. And you can only get away with a story that devoid of answers if you’re writing for a sci-fi anthology.


8. Good Hunting. Based on a Ken Lui short story, ‘Good Hunting’ suffers from one of the best flaws a short story can have: it’s a short story plot, with novel-length ideas.

The science/magic dichotomy by itself is worth a couple dozen pages, but throw in English imperialism in Hong Kong and this really could be a full-length film, to say nothing of the dense novel. Of course, if you’re already familiar with the history of British Hong Kong, it’s mostly just the science/magic dichotomy that really deserves further exploration.

To the short film’s credit, it clearly knows that the events are not the interesting part. They are merely a bridge between the audience and the ideas. However, it’s most intriguing idea never gets more than a surface treatment.


9. The Dump. This one feels like either a parody or an homage to something I haven’t seen. The structure is a common one—an outsider is told a story by a local—but also one that is almost never well used; and ‘The Dump’ joins the ranks of so many semi-historical novels that feel like they’re just padding their word count.

It’s a shame because there’s a repeated line—if you live in a junkyard, the world comes to you—that is so promising, but actually means nothing to the story. We don’t see the world coming to our junkyard dweller. He’s got a weird pet. That’s it.

A man finds a monster, but we skip the interesting part of them becoming friends and go straight to the friend part. The audience insert character is played for a gag at the end. It’s just...nothing. A thoroughly squandered premise.


10. Shape-Shifters. The first of three hyperrealistic, military shorts, it’s a prime example of what not to do in a short story. All of the hallmarks of a Master’s in Creative Writing are here. The structure, the pace, the subtext are all textbook and they amount to what feels like the opening cut scene of an FPS.

Tons of short fiction suffers from this exact thing. It presents a number of interesting ideas—What if the military had werewolves? How would they be treated? Etc.—and none of it matters. The short has nothing to say about these things—not werewolves, the military, or prejudice—it just runs a scenario.

The lesson is that badass ideas are a coat of paint. Putting a racing stripe on an El Camino is not going to make it go faster.


11. Helping Hand. Very possibly the best of the bunch, ‘Helping Hand’ is a masterclass in tension. There’s nothing fancy here, from a storytelling perspective. It’s a ticking clock story that needs no context or explanation. The dialogue is excess bulk.

Mind, the sound design is excellent, but you could watch it in complete silence and still be on the edge of your seat.

The title is a spoiler, which you probably want to avoid, but other than that it deserves multiple rewatchings with note taking.


12. Fish Night. The lone magic realism entry, it ticks all of the genre’s boxes. The easy pace perfectly undermines the danger and once the danger is passed leaves you primed to reflect on the unspoken message.

It’s not a style that a lot of people have the patience for—either reader or writer—but is highly rewarding when executed well.


13. Lucky 13. Of the video-game-sci-fi-military trilogy, this is the only successfully affecting one. Watching ‘Lucky 13’ side-by-side with ‘Shape-Shifters’ is a great exercise for military sci-fi writers (not to mention artists).

‘Lucky 13’ has plenty of badassery to go around, even if it isn’t as high concept as werewolf marines or satanic czarists. What makes ‘13’ work is that it goes for the heart. There’s thrilling danger aplenty, but the story isn’t about being badass, it’s about loss. We’ve all had a beloved inanimate object and lost it.

Anytime you can look at your story and say “we’ve all”, you’re on the right track.


14. Zima Blue. ‘Zima’ joins ‘Witness’ as the most deserving of artists’ attention. Both of them pop with a highly evocative art style that permeates every frame of the short. While all of the shorts are beautiful in their way, only ‘Zima’ and ‘Witness’ are recognizable from a single, random frame.

Structurally, ‘Zima’ is ponderous and if that’s what you’re here for, you’re all set. ‘Zima’ also does itself a favor by adopting a somewhat dry tone and subject from the get-go. These, along with the art style, signal to the audience that it’s time to settle down and breathe in, rather than consume.

The story invites you to philosophize about robots without throwing life or death stakes at you, which I think is welcome. Overt threats to survival cloud the ontological mirror. If you want to think past Skynet, you have to turn the doom meter down.


15. Blindspot. Details are light on the Google for writer/director Vitaliy Shushko, but I’m assuming he’s 22, claims to have learned Japanese from anime, and owns at least three swords that are not half as practical as he believes them to be.

I suspected ‘Blindspot’ was going to be wasting my time within the first minute. The trope-heavy characters would be more respectable if they were named Cool Guy, New Guy, Rude Pig, and The Girl; because at least then we’d know that Shushko understood how bad these characters are.

‘Blindspot’ never gets better. My only guess as to why it’s been included among so many much better works is that series creator Tim Miller was feeling nostalgic about the stories he wrote in middle school.


16. Ice Age. A mostly live-action story that follows a similar structure to ‘The Dump’, but to much better effect. Instead of just receiving the story, our flesh-and-blood audience inserts are interpreting the unfolding story in front of them.

The story itself is mostly tongue-in-cheek and not especially inventive, but is still a solid entry-level story to the social philosophy sub genre.


17. Alternate Timelines. ‘AT’ is a parody of basically the entire time-travel genre, flooded as it is with ‘Let’s Kill Hitler’ stories. (The equally saturated ‘Let’s Save Lincoln’ category getting honorable mention.)

It’s highly effective parody as it knows the genre inside and out and the more Let’s Kill Hitler stories you’ve read, the better it works. Provided you’re familiar with the genre, ‘AT’ provides an excellent model for those looking to take the piss out of a trope.


18. Secret War. The final installment of the military trilogy, ‘Secret War’ is more of the same we got from ‘Shape-Shifters’. Czarists summoned demons and now they’re on the loose. Yay?

Again, it feels like a very long opening cut-scene designed to explain the FPS you’re going to be sinking 40+ hours into; that’s if you bother with the story mode and don’t just go straight to online multiplayer.

As a film, it’s pointless. Far less irritating than ‘Blindspot’, but still only worth watching if you need a specifically faux-historical example of how not to write a story."
"Would your concept of romantic/sexual fidelity change if sex robots or sexual simulations (like those in Minority Report) existed?A lot of monogamous modern couples are comfortable with owning sex toys for personal purposes, not to mention fantasizing about other people. When, in a hypothetical relationship you're in, does a sex toy become such a close approximation of a ""genuine"" sexual encounter (i.e. a humanoid robot) that to engage in sex with it would qualify as cheating on your significant other? Would this change with regard to simulations? Would it matter if the simulations were of pornstars or people you knew in real life?"
"My ranting defense of why the Cybertruck is ""Cyberpunk"".Disclaimer:  I am NOT an Elon Musk, Tesla, Space-X, or Boring Company fanboy.  However, I *do* like much of what Elon Musk is doing/attempting to do with his money.  I am always critical of anything and everything I take interest in, and try very hard not to become blind with fanboy-ism.

**************************

Approaching this from two angles, and trying to keep it short.  

**ANGLE 1- The Elon Angle:**  It seems many popular figures end up having a backlash.  Kevin Hart is such a funny, nice guy...(*BUT HE'S A HOMOPHOBE!*).  Neil De-Grasse Tyson is so smart...(*BUT HE'S A SEX OFFENDER AND IS OVERRATED!*).  Elon Musk is a genius...(*BUT HE'S A GREEDY MEGACORP THAT TREATS HIS EMPLOYEES BADLY!*).  Keanu Reeves is the best person ever...(/r/enoughkeanuspam).

I understand where it comes from, I understand the balance, the yin and yang of celebrity worship.  I am an observer of it all.  I've seen comments saying the Cybertruck is not cyberpunk, or we shouldn't be okay with it, because it's just a greedy millionaire cashing in on cheap aesthetic to sucker fanboys into buying dumb vehicles.  It's not *actually* cyberpunk.  I disagree.  According to these people's view of cyberpunk, the only way a vehicle could *truly* be cyberpunk is if it were 3D printed in a basement and assembled while using satellite scramblers, wearing a camera-fooling facemask and a shirt that says ""fuck megacorps"".  But a cyberpunk setting is more than just the protagonist fighting/hacking ""the man"".  Cyberpunk is a *setting*, a city, a state, a country, a world, a *galaxy*.  Filled with characters, companies, processes, cultures.  Elon Musk is not the protagonist.  He is a *character*.  

Now think about what *you* do as a cyberpunk fan.  Read the books, watch the movies, maybe start listening to synthwave, maybe try some wearable tech, research medical advancements, maybe even make your own programs and devices at home.  Your phone is jailbroken, and I'm sure your desktop on Linux is l33t h4ck0r as fuck.  But I truly think Elon Musk is a cyberpunk fan as well.  He watched the same movies, read the same books as you.  But he has MILLIONS of dollars to play with.  So instead of making wearable tech in his basement, he's able to try to make stuff you see in the books.  Fucking rockets that land back on earth.  Cars that drive and park themselves, and don't need gasoline, they plug into the damn wall.  Space junk cluttering the orbits, attempting to blanket the earth in internet.  He's a cyberpunk fan with a huge fucking budget.  I think this mindset is what resulted in the Cybertruck.  I think the Cybertruck was indeed born of genuine interest in cyberpunk fiction.

****************************************************

**ANGLE 2- The Cybertruck Angle:**  Fuck Elon Musk, let's look at the truck itself.  *IS IT CYBERPUNK?*  IMO, yes.  What is cyberpunk?  High tech, low life, right?  My view of low life isn't just criminal.  My interpretation is ""low life"" *as seen by a megacorp CEO*.  The janitor, the secretary, the teachers, the workers who will never get beyond paycheck-to-paycheck.  Those, IMO, are the low-lifes in cyberpunk.  Not just the l33t h4ck3r drug addicted heroes or body-switching assassins.  *IN THEORY*, this truck could be used by tradesmen.  Roll an A/C unit right up in the bed by lowering the rear using built-in tech.  Fill out the diagnostic paperwork for a customer while the truck drives itself down the highway to the next job.  Pull the truck right up to a remote jobsite and use the onboard air compressor to power your pneumatic tools.  It's a very high-tech vehicle, built not for the typical yuppie shuttling around buying shit, but for the *low lifes* out there hauling shit around.  It looks the part.  Sure, it was built by a millionaire.  Most things you need/want are.  It just so happens *this* millionaire thought it would be cool to make the truck *look* like the movies/books it was inspired by.

********************************

In conclusion, I think the Cybertruck fits in with cyberpunk in general.  If a drawing of a chick with a robot leg holding a laser blaster in her crotch is cyberpunk, then so is a truck that looks like it is literally straight out of Blade Runner and actually has a lot of the technology to back up the aesthetic.  Many don't like the looks, even from a cyberpunk standpoint.  To that, I say ""Well, god damn, it's the first one.  Remember PS1 graphics?  Well, there ya go.""

Just my .02 credits."
"Ever wondered why it's always dark cloudy and raining in cyberpunk cities?Cyberpunk is generally set in the future, when global warming has dramatically affected the world. The cities you see are kept habitable through stratospheric sulphate aerosols, which are sprayed in the atmosphere by airplanes. These aerosols reduce temperatures, by blocking sunlight. As a consequence the sky is dark and cloudy.

Because the whole world has gotten warmer and cities home to people are artificially kept relatively cold, rain tends to fall in these cities. After all, when air gets colder it can hold less moisture, thus the moisture turns into rain. Cyberpunk cities tend to feature chronic rain, because the cities are kept cold artificially by engineering the local climate. Of course exposing yourself to all of these sulphate airosols sprayed in the air is not very good for your lungs. For this reason it's common for people to wear gas masks.

Another thing you'll notice is that there are no fat people, children or elderly people. Everyone seems to be in their twenties and all the women tend to be scantily clad. The thing is that aging has essentially been cured in the cyberpunk dystopia. Because people can live for hundreds of years, the threat of overpopulation is a genuine problem, hence the enormous cities. Marriage, parenthood, the traditional relationships are frowned upon. Sexual promiscuity is encouraged by the culture and abortion is no taboo. STD's are a thing of the past, obesity is trivial to prevent too. In response to overpopulation and climate change, the diet has also dramatically changed. You'll notice that Western looking people in cyberpunk often eat with chopsticks. They seem to eat primarily stuff that takes little space to cultivate (rice, soy, quorn etcetera).

This doesn't mean there are no problems. The main problem is rampant income inequality. There is still nature left in the cyberpunk world and ample space for those who can afford it, but it's inhabited by the descendants of those who founded the giant companies that control most of the world. The rest of humanity is stuck in tiny apartments in overpopulated cities, with no genuine chance of social mobility because technological progress has more or less stagnated and there are no new opportunities left to exploit.

Another problem that's widespread is alienation and loneliness. Because everyone has access to extremely good entertainment and virtual reality, the awkwardness inherent to interacting with real human beings makes people socially anxious. The people in cyberpunk are very intelligent too, so they tend to overanalyze social interaction. Interacting with machines is what people are familiar with, interacting with human beings with agency of their own is a struggle.

With nothing left to believe in and no hope for the future, people have grown cynical and nihilistic. Drug use is rampant and people don't mind spending days living out in virtual reality or just injecting drugs and sitting in a warm bath. All the main problems in life can be solved with little struggle. There are some problems that can't be easily solved in this society, but they're impossible to solve for normal people anyway. As a result most people don't have much of a reason to do anything and simply sedate themselves with entertainment. Sex robots, warm baths, virtual reality, drugs, that sort of stuff.

"Legality of homemade alternative prostheticsThe other day, I got to thinking what sort of things I'd want to be able to do with a prosthetic arm. Assume I still have my arm down to the elbow and a little ways further but the forearm and hand are robotic.

If my nerves have been salvaged, reimplanted in my upper arm and connect to the prosthetic wirelessly, there's no good reason why I could not then build my own swappable prosthetics which use the same wireless protocol. Nothing as sophisticated as a full hand with individually motorized fingers, wrist and so on, but I already have one of those in this scenario. What I'm after is novelty, and adaptability.

If I build various replacement limbs that would attach the same way and receive the same signals, they might have a buzzsaw for a hand, or a flamethrower, an uzi (handle removed, obvious legal issues here, no contest, so don't bother pointing this out) and various other tools and weapons which scifi cyborgs often substitute for a hand. 

If I'm building something, being able to swap out my hand for a power tool sounds like it'd be genuinely useful. The only inputs it really needs to receive are wrist rotation and the trigger/throttle for the tool.

Assuming someone were to sell these limbs, *no guns though*, would a powertool prosthetic be legal? Where could you wear it? Would one with the potential to injure someone be considered a weapon even if it has useful non-weapon uses?  "
"A genre of fiction, the world we live in today.**this is a collected perspective from the responses to [my rant yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/yv4sg/tili_wasnt_a_cyberpunk/). i thought it made more sense than anything i'd say**

-----

what do you mean by: i keep running into the same problems?

Our culture accelerates towards the wall.

So many people didn't seem to expect that the corporations and businesses and the state itself would be the monstrosities that they were in works of cyberpunk science fiction. The security industrial state took over and 1984 usurped 2001. Snow Crash was mostly right. 

There's a bridge being gapped, but it doesn't feel genuine to us because as we can see right now, poverty still exists, there's still people on earth who don't even have the luxury of basic hygiene and medical supplies. Meanwhile the military industrial complex is creating surveillance drones, powerful corporations are considering augmented reality for mass-production, asteroid mining is now a thing, and so on and so forth.

Perhaps it will be a while until something which can be considered the equivalent of cyberpunk comes along. Maybe technology and the access to the Internet has to become as widespread as the radio and the TV before we can have some more ""updated cyberpunk"".

and what do you mean by: i want an accurate idea of the world i'm apart of?

Have you built a 3D printer yet?
How about a CNC machine? Programming? Got a robot yet? 

Technology: Make it yourself, asshole. That's cyberpunk as fuck. 

If you're looking for contemporary analysis, you should be hanging around people who study/work with contemporary events. People trading digital items for real cash or killing eachother over them. Some of the things described in the cyberpunk literature and films have already come to exist and some of the events have already happened.

I think you're missing that cyberpunk that is alive and real in this world.
Each discipline has to (and is) handling cyberpunk in its own real and practical way.

Honestly the basic themes of cyberpunk have never been more relevant

Why would you think a subgenre of fiction also existed in the real world? It's a very sobering feeling, realizing you no longer enjoy something you once loved. 


tl;dr OP is a fag. I kicked it in some weird Internet cafés in Thailand that are about as cyberpunk as it gets.

*my ranting was never going to answer any of my questions, let alone any else's. seeing that's these are all your answers, i hope this satisfies. thanks to everyone for the new links and perspectives, i keep forgetting nothing's just black and white*"
"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

Just out at 2am getting pizza made by a robot at an automatic kiosk
"Mr. Robot Decoded, a documentary exploring the authenticity of hacking on the show, airs tonight on USA Network."
"How To Eat Like A CyberpunkWe talk about the look of the Cyberpunk future, the neon signs and rainslicked streets, the trenchcoats and black leathers, usually hair partially shaved in weird designs due to neural jacks and other augments, weird tattoos or eyes or the like.

What I find myself wondering is the bits of the atmosphere that aren't usually shown, the life the people live in these worlds have.  This time, I am thinking food. Most Cyberpunk fiction goes about how the food sources are limited, usually loss of farmland due to ecological issues and/or human expansion. That makes fresh real food an expense that the normal working class person experiences infrequently with rarity depending on the world. It could be never to as little as once a month and treated like a dinner at a high class place or a special treat delivery order that you save for.

They'll usually be artificial food sources like lab grown mushrooms or a paste made from bugs or shrimp or similar for proteins. Lab grown substitutes that can then be flavored and shaped and made to be a burger or a slice of chicken. Some will have it being a slurry at the cheapest levels, like Kibble in Cyberpunk RPG or the Robocop bit where they have a rudimentary paste to maintain his organic systems and according to one exec it 'tastes like baby food'.

So, I got to thinking, we have a lot of similar food sources today that could probably be considered in that same category. I mean, we even have a Soylent meal replacement as life imitates art. Some discussions on this usually devolve into a collection of 'drugs (some prescribed, some illegal), energy drinks, ramen, any rodents and/or insects'. I do like this post from [the Shadowrun Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/7r1igg/sixth_world_supplements_cyberpunk_food/) that talks about how Taco Bell is a great example of Cyberpunk in the food industry, by turning an authentic culture's food to a bland essentially robotically designed and prepared food.

We've had TikToks making mashed potatoes using Pringles and regular bag chips as an example of what I imagine the sort of food making process would look like. Open a can or bag of machine processed items, dump some into a cooker. Add some flavoring (if not already added during manufacturing process) and you now have your daily slop. There are a few blogs like [this one](https://myriadwhimsies.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/seitan-for-carnivores-homemade-pseudo-meat/) doing recipes to try and approximate sci-fi food using modern ingredients. And there were events like Flooded, an early 2000s dinner event to show what would food be like if the oceans rose immensely, or The Next Menu from 2017 which was a post-apoc dinner from foods that would be available in that version of the future.  [This article on Grubstreet](https://www.grubstreet.com/2019/11/10-trailblazing-chefs-cook-the-food-of-the-future.html) has 10 cooks preparing what they felt would be 2029's food options. 

After all that lead in, I'm wondering what people today would consider the most Cyberpunk foods they could get their hands on. I would imagine a lot of it would be processed foods over non, probably mostly synthetic flavors. Maybe those vegetarian meat replacements as opposed to actual meat, or tofu with flavoring? Would it be chopped and served in noodles or a soup or would it be some whole glob of something?"
"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

"Would your concept of romantic/sexual fidelity change if sex robots or sexual simulations (like those in Minority Report) existed?A lot of monogamous modern couples are comfortable with owning sex toys for personal purposes, not to mention fantasizing about other people. When, in a hypothetical relationship you're in, does a sex toy become such a close approximation of a ""genuine"" sexual encounter (i.e. a humanoid robot) that to engage in sex with it would qualify as cheating on your significant other? Would this change with regard to simulations? Would it matter if the simulations were of pornstars or people you knew in real life?"
"(New) Cyberpunk/SciFi Novel - PsyTekA weighty, biting, cold just sort of... hung there, freely of its own accord, occupying the empty void ahead, somehow threatening its surrounding space with the expectation and gravitas of tangible existence, despite not possessing the title itself.

I imagine not unlike how Death must have. Perched high, her wings' recently ruffled visage, kept pulled back, obscuring any hint of trepidation she may feel from all but the most astutely observant. There she perched, still, stuck, unseen, in a world where she has no purpose.

So she waited…,

…and watched.

New Chicago had been unusually cool that Monday morning, even with it still being so early in the year, just March thirteenth, after all. Even for the mostly digitally-lit exterior walls of the building, any hint of actual sunlight just barely was able to scratch through a few small gaps between some of the towering structures, the shortest of which still reaching over twenty-thousand feet high. It was notably cooler that morning, though, despite even considering all of that.

On nearly any Monday, or— essentially any day…, as long as it includes the last 200 years

the last 200 years or so, she, like every single other day of the week, remained perched, still... and waited....and waited. She waited, patiently, while PsyTek, over the course of that time, singlehandedly and systematically replaced, the entire institution of corporations, municipalities, and eventually, city and state governmental bodies that essentially made up what was the previous world, before developing into what it is now, modern-day, 2547 PsyTek™

She continued to watch, and witnessing as the delicate system of greed that once moved the world's machine along almost effortlessly, fell, piece by piece, one by one, dominos, unable to support the weight of its prior, unable to stop its own self-destruction once started.

Pharmaceutical companies failed first, as PsyTek's Division 1 supplanted the previous excuse for medical care with a solution that actually helped the public.

Next out was oil and public transport, the responsibilities for which, later transitioned over to fall PsyTek responsibility. Once Division 2 was founded in April of 2360, modes of transport were suddenly provided to civilians that were previously limited or had none, prior.

Research into new technologies didn't take long to leave us without any need for fossil fuels for any reason.

And...While distant oil kingdoms collapsed, she remained, perched, waiting.along with any financial and political support with it.

As perpetual war, and drugs, (and ironically, the war on drugs), the previous world was left were the fuel of the prior global economy, now foreign to many, as more and more civilians join PsyTek's cause, war was found left without an enemy. War always follows oil, and without the financial and political backing, no one was ready to start a conflict As heavy a cost as war carries, financially, and historically, with people, found themselves struggling to finance wars, much less the soldiers in it. As a result,

She watched, still, as failed war income quickly led to global economic collapse of the world that had been. She watched, still, as war and selling a treatment-over-cure could no longer support, or provide the cushion the company needed to keep enough stock to sell overpriced goods to their own underpaid employees. as they gave the world a global cure of nearly every known disease and sickness, began to feed the hungry, and house the homeless.

She watched an old-world fade into nonexistence, replaced with a perfect society, where they even learned ways to even temper violence within oneself, not with punishment, but with compassion, and eventually even managing to... ""cure death itself"" ™.

That one always made her wince.

It was salt in an already raw wound-turned marketing campaign. The slogan became a persistent reminder of her inability to perform the simple task she was assigned. Really, they just temporarily avoided her, at best. Like stopping a clock. Limbs can be regrown, cancer removed as if it were a mole, even aging can be reversed through a simple, free, cellular regeneration process, and a quick fifteen-minute trip to the clinic.

But on that particularly cold morning... Death stirred. She woke up, as a girl with black hair, smoking a clove cigarette passed underneath. For the first time in over 200 years, the task given by her brother had meaning. She's been waiting for a long time...

&#x200B;

\-- But this isn't death's story. No.

\-- This story belongs to the girl with dark hair, smoking a clove, and how she learns the truth. The girl who rose Death from her slumber.  


&#x200B;

\-- -- -- -- Present Day New Chicago -- -- -- -- -- --

24-year-old, soon-to-be Tek, Kay LeBlanc, is a persistently sarcastic interface designer at InMind Designs, who... also sort of happens to occasionally hear voices when she gets stressed.

Tyler Warren, head of PsyTek’s Division 5, just took a personal interest in her after seeing her deliver an impressive presentation. The problem is, from the moment he, and PsyTek, show up, life, she finds her world haunted by visions of darkness filled with the sound of screams.

The opportunity is once-in-a-lifetime, though, and she can’t pass it up. From the moment she starts her new life, however, she learns there’s a lot more to her world than anyone had ever thought.

Every perfect world has a cost, and as she learns what that cost is, who, and more importantly what, she is, becomes clear

\* \* \* \* || Hi guys! - Melanie, author of PsyTek here! || \* \* \* \*

So I was digging around Reddit the other night, bored, like ya' do, and came across (because for some reason I hadn't before now \*is dumb\* \^\_\^\`) this amazing community of Cyberpunk fans, and thought to myself—

""Self,"" I said, “This would be the absolutely perfect group of unique characters to share my recently debuted novel with!”(with approval from the mods, of course! Ty [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/) mods <3 <3 )

It's the first novel of what will be *at least* a 3-part series, minimum, Additionally, there are plans for at least 2 specific character origin story one-off novels.

Everyone who has read it so far has loved it, the only complaint so far is asking where's the second book!

I know you guys will be my most critical(and I appreciate you for that! <3 )but also... if I did it JUST right...I think (or hope, at the very least!) that you guys will enjoy it probably more than any regular plain-old non-belonging-in-the-future tie-wearing office worker.(Nothing against those guys-- you should read it too! \^\_\^\` lol)

But-- this being [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/) <3I want to do something SPECIAL for you all,

if you're interested! Since it's my new debut novel, I know it's not likely you've read it yet, so--

I'd love to hear any questions or thoughts about the book that might help bring you into the world of PsyTek, or just spark a new interest that hadn't quite hit flashpoint before?(I escape there, often, in my mind O.O)But; Ask me about the world, the tech, the progress, whatever you'd like.The world of PsyTek is VERY extensively built in my head, spanning millennia, with some very rich and interesting characters.

You can even ask me about me! I might even answer it! \^\_\^\`(in reality, I probably will answer, and then you'll all ask me to stop sharing)

:-p

Also, I'd like to add a specific note-- I wrote the Synopsis completely new, for [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/). I wanted to give a special little interesting side story, as a special gift to a community I love <3 That being said....SOME (\*most\*) of it MAY (\*was definitely\*) written after 3 days awake.I delayed posting to keep tweaking the ""Synopsis"" community story repeatedly because I want to share quality content and stories, so. If there's something off, obvious typo, etc.. probably because of 3 days awake(/#onlyslightlydelerious). Sorry!!

\[Some super-quick tidbits on me for any who may be interested who tf\]- 25+ year web developer/programmer- Outside of writing books or code, I'm also a professional juggler- Ex sushi chef, Air Force Veteran, Computer Gamer (mostly just lack of time)- I live full-time in an RV named ""Serenity""- Mr. Robot is TV/writing genius (dunno if qualifies as Cyberpunk, but still totally true)- New Tron merch kicked Tron (Orig) merch's butt (those stickers....)- That's okay though, b/c I think our Blade Runner (Orig) was better (thoughts?)- Proud LGBTQ+ Author

(I don't believe anyone other than personal friends knows these, so you guys are actually getting kind of a super extra exclusive-- I have to make sure not to cheat out my followers on any paid platforms)

"I wrote a cyberpunk story for a writing class. Thought I'd share it with you guys. [1,000 words]The Justicar jolted to life, like a refrigerator breaking its idle state, before leaving its docking spot. This was Calen’s cue that the damn thing was answering a radio request. He followed the robot as it made its way down the train. Mag-lev, he corrected himself. Trains were only a fragment of his dad’s old stories.

He rode the mag-lev from end to end, preying on moments just like this. It was time to earn a living. The commotion in the third car promised Calen a few more chits for his ultimate fund. Hopefully, a suppressing was in order.

He didn’t mean that in a bad way, however. Seeing people go through entire phases of suppression just breaks his heart, and he wouldn’t wish that upon his worst enemies. It does take its toll on the psyche sometimes, knowing that this was his only way of earning a living at the moment.

It gives him so much satisfaction seeing people benefit from the pain blockers, even if they call him an extortionist or a cheat along the way. Surely, it beats seeing his fellow people suffering the maximum pain a human body was designed to endure.

“Leave me alone, you fuckin’ tinheads!” said a scruffy man, his shoulder length hair swaying across his face as he turned from one Justicar to the other. “I shouldn’t be paying no fuckin’ full price for a ride. I have worker’s status, just like everyone else!”

These early-model Justicars weren’t as advanced as their modern counterparts. What was once the main force of policing has today become relegated to gutter work—small infractions and low-priority areas. Every time one of these things spoke, it seemed to take most of its processing power. “Please provide Wristjack for inspection,” it said.

“Good. That’s right. Run the damn thing so you pieces of shit can leave me alone.” The stranger stuck out his wrist.

The Justicar whirred, extended its metal hand, and whipped out a wand, a flood of green light shining wherever it waved. It was shaped like a wand, but to Calen’s eyes, these things were just interchangeable fingers the Justicars had in their fists. The Justicar pointed the green light at the stranger’s wrist, then whirred once more.

“Worker status... terminated. Tier-two infraction incurred. Penalty... suppression.”

The stranger’s eyes widened, framed by the hair stuck to his sweaty forehead and cheeks. “N-no. T-they said my pass would still be valid for the day! Termination’s not official till I get home! I’m still a worker!” He yanked his hand from the Justicar, staggering backwards from his effort.

“Please cooperate... or harsher measures will be implemented.”

“No please! It’s Cycorp’s fault! Check their systems, they would know! They *should* know! O-or run the scan again!”

A tier-two infraction for just a little misdemeanour? Calen welcomed money in the bank, but this seemed a little much. Someone should look into reprogramming these tinheads. Slum-workers were still human after all.

“Please, no. I’ll pay. I’ll get the money. I’ll get it by the end of the week, please.”

“Your cooperation will be appreciated. This is your second warning.”

“C-c’mon. There’s no need for—ow!”

Another wand, with a syringe extension this time, jabbed at the stranger’s Wristjack. A brief hiss punctuated the silence in the cabin. Those who haven’t left the car initially were now starting evacuate. The stranger screamed, the squeals of the mag-lev providing an oddly apt backing track.

The syringe retracted to the hand it came out of, after which the Justicar backed up and wheeled away, leaving the stranger to whimper on the floor. He’s going to have a long two days ahead of him—right after the pain kicks in tonight.

The man crouched, his fists tight, himself on the verge of hyperventilation.

“I can help you.”

The stranger turned around with a start.

Calen nodded at the man’s Wristjack. “I can help you with that.”

A sneer. Somehow, he still managed a sneer. “Whaddaya want?”

“Three chits.”

“You’re crazy. You’re all fuckin’ crazy. Three chits? I’ll sit through the entire suppression before I give you three fuckin’ chits.”

It was easy to tell how much to charge someone. First-time offenders paid the most, because they’ve never felt the pain of a suppression before. Had he been a repeat offender, he would’ve bargained at the sight of a dealer.

This guy didn’t know it yet, but he’d help Calen get a few chits closer to his goal. He fished around in his jacket and produced a black card.

“For when you need me.”

“You even want me to pay for a cryptocall? Huh. What do you take me for? Hey, asshole! Where you going?”

Calen left the cabin and returned to blend into the rest of the crowd. He wasn’t proud, making a living out of other people’s pain, but it was something he had to do, at least until he bought a new EMP slug. Then he’d go back to the big leagues.

He had a taste of major pharmaceutical runs once, until he had spent his last slug on Darlene. Calen still had no clue if it was the best decision he’s made. He hasn’t seen her since. It wouldn’t be half bad if she didn’t want to talk to him. But he’d be devastated if she *couldn’t*.

The only way to know for sure was to head on to New Central and see if he could find her again. Getting there would mean money. Lots of it. And the only way to get that much money was through setting foot in the big leagues again.

The mag-lev jerked to a halt and Calen got off at the stop. He walked through the tunnels, the metallic smells a stark reminder of where he was—the underbelly of the Sprawl. Surrounded by more tinheads than humans. Maybe he should just move on. Forget about Darlene. Maybe getting to New Central was a terrible idea.

His Wristjack vibrated. Those thoughts would have to wait. Right now, he had another potential victim—or client, whichever way you wanna put it—just three blocks away. A few chits at a time would have to do for now."

"Roundup of TheGM's film synopses and impressions of various cyberpunk, retrowave, synthwave, and outrun songs, from Youtube commentsSo some of you may be familiar with the NewRetroWave music channel on Youtube. The soundtracks there range from cyberpunk Blade Runner tribute songs, synthwave, 80s Miami Vice era throwback songs, or retrowave as it's called, outrun. 

I started noticing that one user would often write up a film synopsis-esque piece of writing, or literary impression of the soundtrack. I started collecting them because I thought they were pretty evocative. They're only between a sentence or two to a paragraph, so they're not long, but there's already a narrative presence there in most of them. I think the more serious cyberpunk ones actually come pretty close to Gibson's writing style, and a lot of the other ones capture the retrofuturistic, Sylvester Stallone / Kurt Russell type cinema vehicle, hardboiled revenge cop film, or 80s sci fi fiction tone. A handful are in a Richard Simmons full on cheesy aerobics video style. 

I feel like this guy has this little obscure piece of cyberpunk net culture and wanted to post them here. Reddit's fucking with the formatting so each paragraph and spacing is a different one.

Today is the 7th week of fighting in New Australia as United Federation Forces conduct search and destroy missions on New Order Command or NO-Com outposts in the region. The area has become a hotbed for the Techno-Terrorist group since the withdrawal of multiple conglomerates after the outcome of the Mineral Wars do to them contaminating the region with various viruses and toxins. Uni-Fed said that the recent liberation of the ruins of Nova-Brisbane, that loses are an acceptable level with only 2000 confirmed casualties.

*The veil of darkness never truly sets on the city. The sun is blotted out by the mega-towers, the belching smoke stacks and venting steam chutes. down here on the street where the only light comes from the neon signs and police crawlers, darkness is king.

"Zeta - Cyberpunk storyZeta perched at the counter of a future dive, surrounded by the neon-bathed aura of a culture in decay. The patrons were all variations on a theme - humanoid rabbits, long-eared and cybernetically enhanced. She wore a form-fitting jumpsuit that was more machine than fabric, its slick contours reflecting the light with a synthetic gleam. Her augmented eye scanned the dive's denizens, ever-vigilant for any sign of danger.

The walls were alive with adverts for the latest cybernetic enhancements, the music a thumping, bass-heavy pulse that rattled the very foundations of the bar. The air was heavy with the tang of ethanol and the metallic tang of circuitry. The robotic bartender dispensed drinks with programmed efficiency, and the patrons were all lost in their own augmented realities.

Zeta's gaze was fixed on her datapad, fingers tapping out a furious staccato as she hacked into a secure network. She was lost in the code, the very essence of the Matrix, when a voice crackled in her ear, pulling her back to reality. ""Zeta, we need you,"" the voice whispered urgently.

She slid the datapad into a hidden pocket, all senses on alert, and disappeared into the night, a shadow in the neon-tinged world of Aetherion."

Tons of cyberpunk imagery in here, and a pretty fun theme to boot. This video is part of a series I'm making surrounding the interviews I conducted while researching my thesis project, Anticipating Future Scenarios for Sex Robots. I spoke with policy makers, activists, ethicists, a sex therapist and RenderMan- hacker and arguably the foremost expert on sex tech security, A later video on hacking sex robots will feature him heavily.

[https://odysee.com/@TheSexRobotShow:f/Episode1:52d](https://odysee.com/@TheSexRobotShow:f/Episode1:52d)"
"COVID-19, police and robots[This article](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/smart-cities-news/robots-can-deliver-smart-policing-in-the-post-covid-19-reality) describes the somewhat recent trend in smart policing, i.e. the use of robots in police forces. The author is clearly in favor of an increase of this trend, and is probably aware of some common cyberpunk tropes that everyone has heard about a robot-dominated world: ''The use of robots in cities should come with trust-building messages in  the media to dispel concerns that a dystopian future looms.'' The most notable examples are in Singapore.

I think the most cyberpunk thing in this article is the mix between:

a)  The belief that police forces are necessarily a good thing for a community (but what should we expect from a Research Fellow with the Centre of Excellence for National Security?);

and

b) The belief that integrating 'smart' technology into police forces can only increase their beneficial effect. 

The author thinks the pandemic has put extra pressure on organizations to use other ways to enforce social distancing, and I think he's right. However, this 'robotization' would've happened at some point, since the trend has been to put extra money in police gear and gadgets, transforming a police force that sometimes look more like a proto-Robocop than anything else."
"Real-Life Cyberpunk VS Fictional Cyberpunk: Fiction Gets Only One Big Thing WrongThe real personal quality needed to 'succeed' as a working-class American isn't cleverness, or studiousness, or industriousness, or diligence, or courage, or charisma, or even 'working hard'
How could they be? Your boss doesn't have any of those qualities nor does your bosses boss nor do almost any of the hogs your ever likely to meet if you are a typical American.  So what decides who actually rises through the ranks of the American Working-Class. The total capitulation to Capitalist Authority. Total subservience to a hierarchy which is based  on being an unquestioning obedient automoton: a robot which runs on corn-syrup. To never ask for or expect anything but the shittiest cheapest addictive consumer filth the Ruling Class can maximize their profit margin with. To secure for yourself some portion of the electronic flashing toys produced in slave factories on the other side of the world and distributed by other faceless voiceless robots like you to offer you enough distraction that you no longer care that you aren't allowed to say, do, or own anything that would actually empower you: electronic toys that spy on you so the new slave overseers, who exist in the shadows of some State Security office rather than in the scorching fields and who wield  the fiberoptic cables of the omnipresent digital surveillance network rather than whips, can ensure that you never even think of doing something that would so much as mildly annoy your masters.

The great fiction of the Cyberpunk fiction genre isn't the naked and overwhelming evil of the late Capitalist Corporate Surveillance State. No evil described in fiction can be an exaggeration when the description of  human suffering caused by Capitalism would fill too many pages to even be read in one lifetime, pages that are written faster than anyone could read. All to concentrate all material socioeconomic power into the hands of 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of humanity. And for no great purpose, no grand design, no promise except the private power of the most evil and unaccountable men in the history of civilization.

"Long rambling I see a lot of posts about how to make a room or house more ""cyberpunk"" or even about some ""cyberpunk type jobs"" So here's my take. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  The first thing to understand about the cyberpunk aesthetic (beyond clothing, and neon lights) is that we already live in a technologically advanced borderline dystopian ""future"". It's no longer something of the future, it is the present. Robotic food delivery systems, self driving vehicles, even the poorest of people with cheap end smartphones, facebook and youtube accounts etc. Even the small mom and pop gas station down the street from me who hasnt updated the decor since the 1980s supports contactless payment allowing me to whip out my phone and pay for cigarettes using my Google Pay account, next to a literal wall of surveillance camera monitors covering every square inch of the place. I hop into my 2018 elantra, which is a cheaper model vehicle and back out watching the back up camera on my touch screen display in the middle of the console as my phone pairs via bluetooth to the same monitor, after a few seconds a synthwave playlist starts via youtube music and off I go. These are the things that would make a cyberpunk fanboy in the 1990s orgasm. 

  Now lets look at how this becomes ""Cyberpunk"" 

&#x200B;

 Cyberpunk is the mix of two genres. The uber technologically futuristic, and the rebellious anti authoritarian punk genres. It is the mix of the corporate gizmos and the DIY attitude of the ""low class"" merging together. ""High Tech, Low Life""  So with that, it actually isn't very hard to not only ""decorate"" in a cyberpunk style, but to start living a cyberpunk life. In one way or another, you have to be connected to the criminal element. This does not mean you have to start breaking laws, you can work to stop people from breaking laws... or not, but there's got to be some level of criminality and rebellion. I'm not suggesting anyone do anything illegal, but thinking about how that would look today I do have some ideas for ""side gigs"" 

&#x200B;

  Skip tracing - This is not contact tracing (mapping covid19 cases) Skip tracing is literally using the internet and OSINT (open source intelligence) to locate people who have ""skipped town"" This could be for a debt collection agency, fugitive recovery (bounty hunting) or private investigator services. Check state requirements to get licensed and you could start taking on jobs when you want as a freelancer, or you can work for an agency. 

&#x200B;

  Underground Pharmacist - Yes, the first thing you think of is a drug dealer, and that's totally viable. Also though, one could sell nootropic blends, or certain medications to treat illnesses. How you aquire that, the legality etc is up to you. Could be anything from weed, to oxyracetam, to asthma inhalers. 

&#x200B;

  Pirate - Yeah this is really illegal, but i've already made my disclaimer. Flash drives are cheap, and movies that havent hit streaming services yet or are behind paywalls ( matrix 4 streaming on HBOs streaming service) for example. But could also be software like photoshop or FL studio 21. Who knows. 

&#x200B;

  Uber - yeah this one isnt very creative, but you can take on gigs anytime you want. This seems very cyberpunk to me, and is perfectly legal. Doesn't connect you to that element of criminality at all, so pretty good choice.

&#x200B;

 The main take away about the ""jobs"" is while I suggest having a typical 9-5 that pays well, you can also take on some side gigs that are either legal, in a grey area, or illegal, but having a side hustle seems pretty DIY to me, and if you can get paid via cashapp or some other alternative and deposit that to say, a chime account instead of your normal bank account, that seems pretty cyberpunk to me to begin with. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Aesthetics - 

&#x200B;

  I was sitting on my couch watching a movie the other night and I hit a delta 8 cart, and just looked around my living room and I said to myself ""oh shit, I'm living in that future right now"" I live in an older mobile home in the middle of nowhere that was put here in the early 2000s. So the paint needs to be redone inside, and the linoleum is trashed from previous occupants, but I was sitting on this modern leather couch, watching a movie on a 4k smart TV, my dogs automatic feeder whirred, and one of my ball pythons was climbing up the side of his enclosure. My wifes gaming PC sits where most people would put a kitchen table in the ""dining room"" and the purple and blue lights were illuminating that space. In every room of this house is a computer set up, and a television screen. I dont own a stove, instead we have air fryers, insta pots, and hot plates set up in the kitchen in neat order next to the coffee maker and it makes me think of a food truck along that wall next to the fridge. I have a ring video doorbell, and laptops everywhere.  Sounds pretty normal right? But what would someone from the 90s think walking into my house? So... I looked at my ""office desk"" which is an L shape in the corner and I thought about some cool things I could add to up the ""cyberpunkesque"" 

&#x200B;

  Mini 3D printer - The only reason I havent bought one yet, is I don't really have ideas of what I would print with it, but I think I missed the point there. Doesn't matter what I print, it's the ABILITY that makes it worth it. 

&#x200B;

  Mini fridge - not so techie, but a small cheap minifridge on the desk next to the 3d printer with energy or kratom shots in it would be dope. 

&#x200B;

  Repurposed electronics - I have way too many old cellphones in a drawer. I did think about putting a textfree number on one, and leaving it on a counter in the living room connected to wifi and giving the number out as a ""home"" number. I also have a broken laptop (screen broken off, just keyboard portion) thats connected to a small cheap tv in my ""office"" via HDMI I use for livestreams of the news in the corner. Any other ideas? Id love to hear them. 

&#x200B;

  Obvious - Neon led lights under furniture, and printed posters of corporate logos ( found some cool fake ones on google images that boost up the cyberpunkishness)

  Vehicle - Since cyberpunk is all about DIY, having an older vehicle would actually make it better adding in after market technologies. I don't have an oldervehicle, but I could still add in this newer CB radio I came across for my longer trips to listen in to truckers when I start seeing lots of break lights on the highway and them pulling over (happens a lot, and usually a crash) HUD display (I already can see most things on my dash, but seeing that on my windshield infront of my steering wheel would just be cool, and they are cheap on amazon) I also found a cheap GPS locator to find your car with your phone, for those days where I forget which side of the parking lot I parked on or in the event my car is stolen. (I financed it, so the bank already has one on it, but Id like to see it myself too) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  Activities - Basically, get out into the night life. Go to the dive bars, go to the dance clubs, take someone up on a free seminar being hosted at a hotel in the middle of the city. Go have a bon fire with some friends in the middle of nowhere and watch a movie projected on the side of the house, whatever. Get out and roam is also part of the game. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Im ranting at this point, having tried a new nootropic ""energy shot"" my thoughts are getting a bit scrambled but the main take away is, rebel by taking on side gigs, go to small shows at bars, sell some safe and legal mood enhancers (or whatever you want) and stack money into a secure account (or crypto wallet), use advanced technology to meet those end goals, and you are living a cyberpunk life. Your rules, Their tech."
"Clyde II, for the lack of a better titleThe Beginning you find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/s71lwi/clyde_a_cyberpunk_shortstory_credit_and_story_in/)  


 ""Good morning, back so early?""

Melody did not look up from the tiny components on her immaculate workbench, while her roommate held open the door for Clyde.

For a machine specifically sized to enter homes, it was a surprisingly clumsy maneuver.

""Rave got raided."" Lucy was audibly pissed and stomped into the kitchen to relieve the stress.

Melody furrowed her brow. Stressed roommate was bad, cleaning up what the whirlwind named Lucy would do to the kitchen might be bad, although she had become much better about that.

She decided that ultimately the high chance of delicious cupcakes, and the futility, meant it was no good to try and calm her down and concentrated on the delicate procedure before her.

""Miss Melody?""

Okay, concentration gone, Melody gave up and turned around to the hovering drone behind her.

""Yes Clyde?""

""I must request replacement of my Less-than-lethal armaments.""

""Alan-fucking-Turing! You emptied the whole magazine of Lessons?! How many people attacked that rave?""

""There was a considerable chance of hardened combat implants in the assailants.""

""How many, Clyde?""

""Three, Miss Melody.""

""What is a >considerable chance<, in this case, Clyde?""

""More than 2%, Miss Melody.""

She massaged her temples.

""Argh, those guys must have glowed after you where done… I'll fab a new mag for you, wait on your pad.""

""Thank you, Miss Melody."" 

The drone sulked off like a scolded teen, a remarkable feat for any airborne vehicle, realy.

Melody stood up and stretched. Shaking her head about the absurdity of overkill, she made her way to the kitchen in search of caffeine and to check if her chance for fresh cupcakes was at least higher than 2%.

Entering the kitchen, she was immediately enveloped in a hug by Lucy.

A Lucy-Hug was a strange experience if one was not used to it.

It had qualities of finding a lost loved one after a disaster.

Or perhaps of being gently crushed by a luxuriously upholstered hydraulic press.

Melody sighted, hugged back and enjoyed, until she was released.

""That bad, huh?""

""I'm making a three tiered cake.""

""Oh, damn, that's bad. No wonder Clyde emptied his whole magazine.""

That brought a smile to Lucys face.

""I thought there was a lot of smoke. Oh well, you know he gets overprotective.""

""Mhm."" 

Melody took a bottle from the fridge and mused, not for the first time, how Lucys near supernatural ability to be beloved by almost everyone could transfer to drones, androids...  basically anything that was smarter than a toaster, human or machine.   
She swore she once saw Lucy befriend a Fuckbot outside of a brothel, and those normally charged even if you just wanted to talk.

Then again, that had been a night full of weirdness and recreational drug use, so maybe she was wrong.

""I'm guessing once you are done, you are going to crash?""

""Yep!""

""I could use your help with a Job this evening, you up for it?""

""Yes!""

""Great! It's going to be so much easier with you.""

""Always."" Another, shorter Lucy-hug and Melody was back at her bench, soldering some tiny diodes into a customers hopelessly obsolete, yet beloved gaming console.

Lucy came by later and placed a slice of mouth watering cake next to her, before turning to bed.

Melody finished the slice, then her work, and before she knew it it was eight in the morning.

It wasn't like their part of the block got much sunlight anyway, and the job tonight would be a long nightshift, so it was time for bed.

Marten was a simple man.

He was also a very a unhappy man

His current predicament was that the woman on the other side of the lobby was neither a threat, nor was she disturbing anybody of importance.  

Only Marten and his colleagues, really.

Had she been a problem of that variety, Marten and his colleagues had had options.

But she just stood there, loudly demanding to be told the way to some nightclub or other, and exhaling copious amounts of alcohol.

They would have loved to tell her the way and be rid of her, but the club she named didn't seem to exist and she didn't accept this information.

The next issues pertained to the cameras, and her clothing.

Her clothing being a rather small, bordering on non-existent issue, which in turn meant leading her out of the door by force was pretty much guaranteed to be detected as 'inappropriate touching' by the cameras, meaning at least a pay deduction and mandatory, unpaid training.

A cursory scan had also shown the angry lady to have implants that would have required several years of Martens pay to afford, so she was probably influential enough to cost someone their job.  

A knock on the side entrance gave Marten a welcome excuse to distance himself further from the situation.

A small, knobby looking repair tech, ladder under one arm, toolbox in the other hand, smiled through the glass.

Marten opened and the Tech shuffled in,  took a look at the scene the lady was still causing, while clicking through work orders with an ancient looking prosthetic hand.

""Busy night?"" he grinned, holding his tablet so that Marten could see it.  
“You have no idea…” he sighted, “so what’s this about now?”  
“Lift three said it needed some repair done.”  
“Hmhm, what exactly broke?” Marten was trying to feign interest, but kept getting distracted by the screaming.  
“Beats me,” the knobbly tech shrugged, “damn thing’s smart enough to complain, but not smart enough to tell us what's wrong. But you might know what that feels like, huh?”   
He smiled at the chaos in the lobby, obviously happy not having to deal with that.  
“Anyway, if you don’t mind, I’d like to start on the diagnostics, I will probably go through the building all night, knowing that model you got here.”  
“Uh, do you need to get out somewhere up at…”  
“Nah, I will not desecrate the holy halls of the execs with my lowly presence.” He did a comically deep bow. “Matter of fact, I will not need to leave the shaft.”  
“Have fun then.” Marten ticked the boxes on the work order that the Tech signified needed ticking and prepared mentally to deal with the angry lady.  


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Melody was not a simple woman.

Neither were her current feelings simple.  
On the plus side, her mental chess had worked out beautifully so far.  
Half naked queen beats underpaid security pawns.  
Add to that an older, slightly ugly face, signs of also being an underpaid pawn, a bit of banter, and she was inside the elevator, like a virus entering a cell.  
Who would have guessed that spending your youth devouring psychology textbooks and working for acting agencies could have a common result?  


Someday she would skin the person who had formulated the mask-printers materials though.   
The stuff was durable, breathable, fooled even sophisticated facial recognition systems... and started to itch about five minutes after putting the face on, so the stalling security guard had been a true test of patience!  
Anyway. “Tamper proof” screws out, panel out, diagnostic tool that totally only legit technicians could get their hands on hooked up, oh, looky looky, there WAS a legit alarm from this lift that hadn’t been sent out, for some reason.  
She hadn’t lied, the model was a total piece of shit, with more bugs than software.  
Her clunky looking, but very much flexible, left flew over the diag-inputs, locking any and all outside door leading to her, now personal, lift.  
Some custom software would make the indicator in the lobby show her “working” if any of the security guys got bored and bothered to check what the little display showed.  
\*Ding\* “Sublevel three: Dust, Disinterest and Blinkenlights!  
Why were the outside of server farms always incredibly dusty? How did seemingly nobody care about the one thing generating money and decisions?   
Melody pondered the issue while carefully removing the mask and placing it gently on the little folding stand from her Toolbag.  
Enormous willpower was needed to not scratch her face off right here and now.  
It was probably that nobody important came down here, because the important people didn’t like the reminder that the servers issued most of the commands at this place.  
She breathed deeply and stretched her legs.  
The running was the second worst part of this job.  
Inserting hearing protection, unrolling the hood from her collar, Putting on a glove, the worst part came closer with every careful bit of prep.  
Key-breaker attached to the bunker-like door, the tool immediately starting to unravel the possible access codes.  
She took a last sip of water before closing up the hood to the tiny vision slit it left.  
The Key-braker indicated it was almost done.  
Melody took a sprinter stance opposite the heavy, warning-label covered door.  
3  
.  
.

.

The door sprung open like some kind of reversed bear-trap and Melody was through, diving into a LED-lit hell.  
Some smart person had figured out hardware components that barely needed any cooling, leading to servers that happily worked at 150°C, and would not slow down before reaching at least 200°C, slightly higher if you kept the air bone dry.  
If your datacenter can’t contain people, you don’t need to worry about noise.  
Even with hearing protection, the sound of thousands of fans shuffling the boiling air around threatened to split her head.  
Time in Hell: 5 seconds, a Timer in her peripheral Vision informed her.  
She was still going at full sprint, slowing down only for a hard left, indicated by an ancient looking arrow, painted onto the floor.  
“If a human can’t survive, all upkeep is done by rack mounted robot arms, that takes care of  physical security, doesn’t it?” Somebody who thought of themselves as a very smart person had decided.  
15 seconds of running through hell, and Melody had almost reached her goal.   
The one piece of tech that was absolutely designed to be fiddled with by a human.  
Because somebody needed to be present, to set up hell.  
Her right pulled on the handle of the Rack-Console, her left leaving it barely enough time to unfold fully, before ramming the connector inside that had sprouted from her palm.  
The console had what looked like a machines seizure of pop-ups and command windows, then the payload was inserted.  
Time in hell: 45 seconds, Halftime for the door.  
Melody barely registered that somebody terrible with naming things had painted “Gerhard” onto the screens bezel, before she slammed the machine back into its place.  
More running, her peripheral gave her a warning that the heat protective suit had now become about as protective as the foil around a baking potato.  
Sweat got wicked out of the seams, and evaporated immediately.  
Panting heavily, she slid through the door, which, registering the only occupant had left, slammed shut behind her, in an even more unnerving mimicry of a bear trap.  
Melody unzipped the facial cover of her hood and gave herself a moment to catch her breath while lying on the refreshingly cold floor.  
Then she crawled over to her toolbox and greedily emptied  it of any and all water.  
When people had decided that nobody was insane enough to breach a room that could ignite paper, they hadn’t considered people like Melody.  
The same people had decided to just put any necessary interfaces as far from the door as possible, failing to realize that this made them incredibly easy to find, even if somebody didn’t know your layout.  
It was the beauty of what had become known as “Data-Diving” that all human decision making in a corporation was done by incredibly dull people, who prided themselves in only interacting with other incredibly dull people.  
Melody packed her kit, gave herself time to dry and then prepared for the worst part of the job: Putting the fucking mask back on her now sweaty face to leave the building."
"A little cyberpunk short story I wrote this morningTales from Building 81

Room 84

Gauge stormed towards the door of Lash's apartment, pushing forward at an unchanging pace despite the hallway before him appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The severely damaged lights above him, flickering. Though they always bugged him, they weren't the cause of his foul mood this time, just icing on the shitcake. Plastic clacked as he fumbled with his keys, too angry to differentiate the one Lash had lent him, until the door swung open with a beep.

A smile to compliment the nice gesture adorned the face of Gauge's friend Tejas, which quickly faded as the latter realized that a key mishap was insufficient to explain the intensity of the dark cloud over Gauge's psyche.

""What's up, man?""

Gauge was hesitant to answer the question, because it would mean admitting that he had allowed one of Tejas' kindest gestures towards him to go to waste. You see, Tejas had ""fixed"" Gauge's rickshaw, which had been chained to the railing at top of the stairs (it was a floor inhabited only by Gauge (illegal subletter) and his friends (slightly more legal subletters)) which reached their terminus around a corner, invisible to those even just one below on the seventh. It was a perfectly good hiding place, and an even better digital bike lock. Two-factor security...all for nothing.

Someone had found his rickshaw, and hacked the lock. ""Hacked"" as in taken off with a hacksaw. All three of the wheels that the artificial spidersilk sentinel had snaked through--stolen, and now Gauge had no night job. He figured he would at least tell Tejas that much.

""I, uh, I might have lost my job.""

""Aw, man! I hope it wasn't my fault,"" Tejas looked up at him, not knowing how to feel.

""No, dude, not at all. You're the only reason I kept that job as long as I did,"" Gauge gushed, guilty at both his inability to tell the truth and for having made his friend anxious. ""And I don't know for sure that I've lost it, actually. Not yet.""

The fact was, Tejas *was* the reason Gauge still(?) had a real job. He had hacked the dastardly tracking device that central management had imposed on his rickshaw in a most easily replicable fashion, detailed below for the non-technical.

First, backstory: Gauge's job as the skipper, main engine, maintenance man, and, up until now, guardian of his rickshaw was predicated upon compliance with an odious auto-sophisticating surveillance apparatus, each update reaching deeper into his dome. He was trapped on a vicious treadmill of having to invent new ways of covering up his stops for bathroom breaks, bubble tea purchases (cheap enough to justify as a work expense, at least in his part of Chinatown), and other basic human needs that needed to remain hidden in order for him to keep his job of cosplaying as a robot. If he failed, the other pedal-pushers, who were all surely doing it, too, would out-compete him, his numbers would fall to the bottom relative to theirs, and the increasingly-efficient System would eject him automatically, no possibility of appeal, no two-weeks notice (completely legal).

As the invisible hand became unbearably more difficult to fool, Tejas offered poor Gauge a solution: He build his friend an invisibility cloak of an exceedingly simple design.

To understand the effectiveness of this basic two-part device, it is important to first understand the course of a normal (haha) night at work for Gauge. In the afternoon, he would pedal to a hot zone meeting point, hand-picked each day by the surveillance technology that terrorized him. At the meeting point, he would be greeted by his competitors, who would form a circle one-by-one around the team leader, who was always the first one there, thanks to his Tesla electric scooter.

Gauge didn't know his team leader's name, nor did he want to. The jerk must have mentioned it at some point, but Gauge, in his internal monologue, just called him Bert. The guy was a dead ringer for the conehead from the cancelled PBS show (lack of funding), with coiffed hair, thick, plastic Harry Potter glasses, and a scarf to boot. He sipped smugly on a latté (where the Hell did he get a latté in Chinatown? Gauge wasn't aware of any such place) rather than making small talk, thank God.

When the last member of the ""team"" finally pedaled, heaving, into the last open spot in the circle (which would surely belong to someone else tomorrow), the meeting began. Bert waved an iPad over the traitorous tracking device on each rickshaw, read off useless information to everyone about how they fucked up yesterday by drinking too much water and going to the bathroom too much, and what they could do differently today get their numbers up. Then he sent them off.

That was it. Gauge couldn't believe it was a job, much less a job that paid for lattés.

But Tejas, loyal, kind, ingenious Tejas, had outsmarted Bert and even the black box. The secret to his device was this: The tracker turned off automatically while charging, and therewhen would not log errors such as water breaks. Taking advantage of this, Tejas hid a battery pack inside the rickshaw with USB charging cable around it coiled, which Gauge could unwind and plug in when necessary. It was simply brilliant!

Under this new arrangement, Gauge would pedal as far from the prying eyes of Bert as possible--something he would have done anyway--and, after logging a safe number of errors for realism's sake, he would plug the tracker in. Gauge made with his tormenter a deal: The box would get juiced up while taking a nice nap, Gauge would relax and lower his risk of constipation by dehydration, and both would still keep their jobs by making more than enough money (which had never been a problem for Gauge, optimization be damned).

But now it had all been for nothing. Gauge, with Tejas still looking at him, struggled to come up with a way to avoid telling him the crushing news of the stolen wheels.

Salvation came in the form of a familiar face and an unfamiliar smell. Benji, the resident chemist, appeared in the doorway to his room, huffing another one of his concoctions. He wore safety goggles, an advanced breathing mask with yellow LEDs indicating it would soon be time to change the filters, and always, *always* a cloud.

In fact, neither Gauge nor Tejas nor even Lash, the only one of them who was supposed to be living there, had ever seen him unaccompanied by a cloud. Or perhaps it was the cloud that was accompanied by him. It was the same story every day...he would open the door to his room (he had his own room because no one would share with him, lucky Benji) and noxious fumes from the latest experiment would billow out, with Benji always emerging eventually (sometimes the other three worried). Genie that he was, it was almost as if the cloud created him, and not the other way around.

It gave Gauge an idea.

""I'm gonna go to the Encampment,"" he diverted, turning to Tejas. ""I need to take my mind off of all this.""

""Keep an eye out, man,"" Tejas implored, still helpful despite everything. ""The guy who stole it might be there.""

He had a point. The Encampment was a model for a new society, free from the mass surveillance, and money-grubbing that ruled the world the rest of us live in. It was also free from things like hygiene, and rule of law. It was entirely possible that Gauge's thief was there, trying to trade the wheels out for drugs.

If Gauge caught the fucker there, he could easily take the wheels back and beat the creep up. He would definitely be banned from the Encampment for life, if anyone sober enough to report his lack of solidarity happened to see it. Not that being banned would matter. Gauge only ever went there for one thing, and though he'd never admit it, it was not something he needed more of.

Halfway down the hall to the elevator that only occasionally came, Gauge saw the most beautiful sight he'd ever seen. Luckily for him, it wasn't the first time, and, if he could find a way to cope with the loss of his livelihood without frying his brain tonight, it wouldn't be the last.

""Joce!"" he squeaked, using his pet name for the love of his life, Jocelyn.

""Hey!"" she returned, equally glad to see him.

(they're not a thing yet, though. Don't rush them)

They ran up to each other, not yet ready to greet with hugs, both swaying warmly with as-of-yet unrequited feelings.

Gauge forgot his troubles, an effect he could have capitalized on instead of going to the camp.

Joce asked him, with characteristic playfulness, ""Where ya headed?""

""Oh, I'm going to the camp,"" replied Gauge, as nonchalant as possible.

Joce scowled. ""Nothing good ever goes on there. Why don't you stay here, where it's less dangerous?""

Gauge looked around the hallway, wondering whether it had ever killed a resident prone to epileptic seizures.

""No, I...I think I'll head out. It's not even dark yet, and I need the fresh air.""

Joce did not like the sound of this. She knew that what really drew him to the Encampment was the exact opposite of ""fresh air"".

""Gauge,"" sternly, ""no ampoules.""

""Of course not,"" he lied, brushing past.

While Gauge takes a rickety ride on an elevator that may very well mercy-kill him before he does the unthinkable, allow me to explain: Ampoules, or ""amps"" as for which Gauge will ask around at the camp, are the latest plague to have been unleashed on Chinatown--an unconscionable invention whose progenitor should have shot himself, I don't care if the man would have gone on to cure cancer. Amps are highly addictive (though Gauge didn't have an addictive personality, so he was only subject to the other deadly effects), directly attack the IQ, and are cut with various cheap poisons that intensify the high, to the benefit of the dealer's profits, and the detriment of our now-even-more-quickly-dying society.

Let's just blow through the part when Gauge plows past the diseased throng of junkies, proselytizers, and US intelligence agents in disguise, because we're just as disgusted by them as as he is.

Eventually, he found a dealer.

Gauge and the dealer went for a walk away from the tents, huddling together so they wouldn't be overheard as they shuffled their way down the alley, just in case.

""So,"" Gauge starts, trying to make small talk, ""How goes the society of the future?""

""What future?"" the dealer coughed. ""It's the same old shit.""

Oh, thought Gauge. He doesn't want to talk.

Gauge should have been so lucky. The dealer launched into a rant.

""These stupid fuckin' kids, thinkin' they're starting something new. How's this gonna be the society of the future, when they can't even break away from the old System? I can't even do my job there--I'm trying to provide an important service! And I can't even set my table up, there. You know why? It's not because of the narcs...damn place is crawling with narcs, but it's not because of the narcs, oh no. It's those damn kids, tweetin' everything they see! They're addicted to their phones. Addicted!"" he scoffed, setting his addictive chemicals out on a pop-up table.

Unfortunately for all of us, he continued: ""Society of the future...bah! There ain't gonna be no future. With those kids tweetin' everything that goes on down here, the feds have more than enough crap on us. It's only a matter of time before they move in and shut the whole thing down.""

It was at that very moment, as the poison salesman placed the last amp down on the table, that a gunshot rang out from the camp. Shouting ensued, loud enough that, even at the end of the alley, Gauge could barely hear the dealer.

""Show's over!""

Like a spider going to work on her prey, the dealer's arms précised the display back into the briefcase with dexterity matched only by their speed. A quantum blur of arm over arm recovered amps, table, and all, disappearing before Gauge could surreptitiously grab one.

""Damn!"" he breathed as the dealer blew past, disappearing along with Gauge's hopes of drowning his sorrows.

As the tents fell and the future burned, on the ground shimmered a glint of hope. Gauge bent down.

With an ominous grin, he stood back up holding a forgotten relic. Despite his surgical precision, the dealer had missed one single amp.

The fluid was brown rather than the usual gold, but Gauge's better judgement had been weakened by the day's craziness. As the sun set and the bright future so many had hoped for was trampled, Gauge released the dark mixture into his body.

Immediately, he regretted it, convulsing as the damage spread to innards that had never before felt the touch of these newly-invented chemicals. He shook as the tingling turned to pain, and joined in the screaming that filled the city.

Bursting through the door of Lash's apartment, Gauge's screaming continued, having never stopped. He would never have been able to unlock the door in his current state, thank God it was still unlocked from earlier.

The other three came rushing from their rooms/closets.

""What's wrong?""

Before Gauge could answer, a knock on the door shook the entire apartment building.

One, two, three.

Cops.

Gauge froze for the first time since his stupid sin, still only for a split second. As he went back to shaking, Lash stepped up to the plate.

Lash opened the door, slipped outside before any of Benji's strange smells could, and shut the door behind him without any indication he was hiding something. Smooth.

""Can I help you, officers?"" he asked with a perfectly-calibrated combo of respectful-yet-not-meek, balanced by confident-yet-not-presumptuous.

The two cops stood there, staring at him coldly, bodycams ruthlessly interpreting Lash's biometric data to the cops' HUDs to see if they could pin on him some offense against public justice. Hesitation could be interpreted as resisting. A cross look could be assault. Failure to make eye contact--lying to the police.

The younger one spoke first, ""Are you Gabriel Peters?""

Lash kept his cool, answering, ""No, sir. I'm Merva Lash, the sole renter of this property.""

Lash was proud to be the only one of the group who had enough of his life together to land a lease, and wanted everyone to know it. Even these two cops who were about to arrest them all.

Inside, Tejas and even Benji watched in horror as Gauge flopped about on the couch like a dying fish.

The rookie cop continued, ""This is the residence of Gabriel Peters, correct?""

Lash would not betray his friend and subletter, and Gauge knew this. Gathering his composure, he stuffed his hands into his pockets, lest his shakes be mistaken by the cops for fear (not that he wasn't rightly terrified).

Before Lash could come up with a lie that, despite his cool, would have instantly doomed them all, Gauge appeared next to him.

""I'm Gabriel Peters,"" he fessed up, sheepishly.

The cops eyed him. Though their visors were mostly transparent, their expressions were unreadable.

""Were you at 34 West Lincoln Street earlier today?""

He knew they meant the Encampment. He also knew that he couldn't lie. It would almost certainly be detected by the inscrutable eye of the technological System Tejas had helped him narrowly avoid earlier that week, but this time, it had the power of arrest.

""Yes.""

The cops' eyes widened.

""And you live here?""

They stepped toward Gauge, but Gauge knew they were really moving for the door. Once they open it, he thought, it's all over.

Gauge took his one final chance to save his friends, knowing he'd be dead before he arrived at the jail anyway.

""No, officer. I was planning to stay here tonight, but I've been living at the Encampment.""

The cops' eyes widened even more, before they set themselves straight and clenched their jaws. The rookie slammed his hand down on Gauge's shoulder.

""You'd better come with us.""

As he was ushered down the hall, Gauge felt the cold chill of regret.

""Wait, I heard the gunshot, but it wasn't me!""

The cops ignored him. His friends stuck their heads out of the door, watching  in horror as he was carted away. Gauge looked back and forth between them and the cops. There was no good answer. He had to use all of whatever brainpower had survived the dreadful amp attack.

""Wait!"" he yelled, pulling away from the cops. He ripped his hands out of his pockets. They shook so violently that the cops began to reach for their weapons, but stopped when they realized what a mess the wreck shivering before them was.

""I've never seen anyone shake like that, not even a tweaker,"" blurted out the rookie.

The older cop focused his eyes on the inside of his visor, then back at his trainee, replying, ""HUD says it's real.""

They both paused for a moment, pondering the miserable creature.

""Do you really think I could even...hold a gun like this?""

The cops looked back and forth between him and the neverending stream information on their HUDs.

At last, wordlessly and with a shared look of distain, they left for the elevator.

Gauge barely made it back inside. Out of the frying pan, into the fire of Hell that coursed through his very veins.

Lash and Tejas watched their redeemer twisting there on the floor, helplessly.

Benji, much to everyone's surprise, knelt down next to the victim. Benji wasn't known to be an altruist, yet he produced a mysterious jar, clearly intended as some remedy to ease Gauge's suffering.

It was several seconds before Gauge even noticed.

""Drink this,"" commanded Benji.

Gauge was dumbfounded.

""Your insides are dissolving. You have a chemical problem, and I am a chemist. So listen to me. Drink it.""

Every faculty of reason that had survived the scourge of the amp told Gauge to resist, yet what was he resisting for? His life was about to be over. What more did he have to lose?

""Drink it.""

No, there had to be some other way. The elevator was always late. The cops would still be standing there waiting for it. They could speed him to the hospital. But why? Gauge had fought so hard to get away from them. Now the only thing standing in the way of Benji's offer was pride.

""Why should I?"" Gauge gasped at him, as defiantly as he could muster.

""Because,"" Benji, who almost never said anything to anyone, rasped, ""It will clear everything out of your system. Everything.""

Gauge tried to look at him skeptically, but all he could manage was a look of pain.

""It's for my cleansing ritual,"" Benji creepily continued, ""And it's the last of my supply. So please, take it, before the damage is permanent. Otherwise, it will be a waste.""

This unexpected ray of kindness, from so unlikely a source, finally broke through to Gauge. He gave in.

""Well,"" nodded Benji as Gauge choked down the last few sips of the brackish piss, ""That ought to do it.""

And, miraculously, it did. Gauge sat there on the floor, soaked in sweat and whatever else, but still, and alive.

Benji chuckled with a perfect brew of self-satisfaction, an amount just small enough to keep Gauge from strangling him, ""It's the least I can do after selling your wheels to make rent this month."""
"Full Service Evictions part 2 (short story)Raymond idly flipped through channels on the TV. There wasn't much on at this hour; the movie channels had the usual assortment of bland, cookie-cutter blockbusters, but the rest were showing reruns of old sitcoms, or talk shows of little interest. A few had already switched to infomercials; that usually didn't happen for another hour, but was increasingly common these days. He winced as one channel played an especially loud advertisement; flipping past it quickly, he stole a look at the hallway, hoping that the noise hadn't awakened his lady.

He settled on an old crime drama from the 1970s. The on-screen guide told him it was a made-for-TV movie. He smiled, popped open a generic-brand 40 ounce malt liquor, and settled in for the kitschy low-grade noir. It seemed like a perfect way to kill the next two hours. Not quite enough to make it to daylight, but close.

From within the walls came scurrying noises; one went straight up and then across the ceiling, between floors. He shivered as he thought of the rats that infested this building. There seemed to be less of them lately, but it was difficult to focus on that when one of them was literally overhead. He tried to hold back his disgust.

Raymond heard shuffling noises coming from the hallway; he didn't turn to see who it was. The on-screen action showed the toughs chasing a lone police officer, panting and wide-eyed with terror. He watched with glazed eyes, not wanting to miss a moment.

""Are you *ever* coming to bed, Raymond?"" The shrill harping could only come from one person.

""Get off my case, Clara,"" he retorted. ""It's not like I have to get up early tomorrow.""

""Yeah...tomorrow, or any *other* day,"" she huffed. ""Did you even *work* tonight?""

""I got done *early*!"" he snapped. ""It was just a quick courier job. No hassles. Everything went smooth as a peach.""

Clara moved in front of the TV, just as the bruisers caught up with the hapless cop. ""More hustles with your hoodlum friends? Are you *ever* going to get a real job, like you promised?""

Raymond bobbed and weaved, trying to regain line-of-sight with the victorious goons. ""Damn it, you're blocking my view! Get the hell out of the way!""

Defiantly, she switched off the TV and stood there, her gaze like icy daggers. Glowering, he clicked the remote to turn it back on. Nothing happened; she was blocking the sensor. Clara smirked as she returned his angry stare.

""You bitch!"" he shouted. ""You made my miss my favorite part!""

Clara clucked her tongue. ""Well, isn't *that* too bad. You already missed the good parts of your son's childhood. I don't hear you whining about *that*!""

Raymond threw his hands up in the air. ""You *wanted* me to come back, after all these years, to try to help you raise him! And here I am! I bring in money when I can, and I keep quiet about living here so you can continue to collect your child assistance! What does it take to make you happy?""

Clara stabbed her finger in his direction. ""How about serving as a better *role model*? I almost had him going to school regularly until *you* showed up. Now he's out on the streets, acting like *you*! The extra money you bring in isn't worth the bad influence!""

Raymond pointed past her, to the TV. ""It got you this fancy cable-TV package, didn't it? You know you watch it as much as I do.""

""Stop changing the subject!"" Clara raged. ""Do you even *know* where your son is right now? How can you raise him if he isn't even *here*? He's out on the streets *right now*, following in your disgraceful footsteps!""

""So what do you want me to do?"" Raymond snorted. ""Leave?""

""Oh, isn't that just *typical*!"" Clara exploded. ""You're gone for years and years, then one day you show up out of nowhere, promising you've changed and that you'll make up for time lost, but once you run into the slightest bit of static, you want to leave again! You're a worthless excuse for a man.""

Raymond didn't reply. He just stared at the ground.

""Why did you *really* come back?"" she accused. ""Did you just need a place to crash?"" Raymond looked up at her suddenly, a sheepish look in his eyes.

Clara gaped. ""Really? That's *it*? You're only here for what *you* can get out of it? All your promises were just *empty*?""

Raymond looked towards the hallway. ""Look at me when I'm talking to you!"" Clara steamed.

""Good job,"" Raymond chided. ""You've woken her up.""

From behind the door jamb, a pair of wide eyes peered fearfully into the living room. As Clara turned to look, they disappeared back into the hallway.

""Muriel?"" Clara cooed. ""Just go back to bed, sweetie.""

Muriel appeared again. ""I can't sleep.""

Raymond gestured angrily. ""See what you did? *I* was being quiet until *you* showed up.""

""Don't *even* start with me!"" Clara turned toward Muriel. ""Why can't you sleep, baby?""

Muriel paused, her eyes fluttering shyly. ""I smell smoke.""

Raymond and Clara looked around nervously, sniffing the air. ""Hey, I think I smell it too,"" Raymond noted.

The building's fire alarm abruptly started to blare. Clara strode towards her bedroom. ""Muriel, honey? Get your jacket and shoes and follow me outside!"" She turned to look at Raymond, but he had already bounded out the window onto the fire escape. She sighed heavily and disappeared inside her room.

Outside, the tenants gaped as smoke drifted out of the open windows and through the seams of the building's failed weatherproofing. Clara and Muriel walked around from the side of the building, sniffling and coughing lightly. They came to a stop a safe distance away, on the sidewalk opposite their tenement, surrounded by neighbors and curious onlookers. Clara swept her eyes over the crowd for Raymond; he was nowhere to be found. Clara scowled angrily.

""That smoke smelled funny, momma,"" Muriel piped up.

""What are you talking about?"" Clara replied dismissively. ""It's smoke. It all smells the same.""

""No, momma,"" Muriel challenged, clinging to her mother's gown. ""It smelled...waxy.""

A nearby kid turned to Muriel. ""Yeah, I noticed that too,"" he concurred. ""Like the kind they have at magic shows. What does it mean?""

A distant din of sirens slowly approached. The crowd watched a convoy of trucks arrive; they looked like police vans, though they didn't bear any government insignia. As they stopped, several people in dark-colored guard uniforms emerged; there were both men and women, though all of them were stoutly built. One of them was taller and thinner; he wore a suit, and observed the action from a distance.

Instead of checking on the tenants, the guards surrounded the building, forming a perimeter. Clara could barely make out a dim emblem on the nearest van, seemingly dark-gray on a black background, consisting of stylized renditions of the letters ""U"" and ""P"". She heard one of them remark on their cell phone that all entrances and exits had been successfully barricaded.

A group of security officers, wearing gas masks, ran inside the building. Another addressed the crowd. ""Remain calm, everyone,"" he assured. ""The smoke will be fixed in just a few moments.""

More sirens converged on the area; before long, a squad of police vans had arrived. Other than their prominent government logos, they looked identical to the vans that arrived before. They parked across the street on both ends, forming a barrier. The officers quickly disembarked and stood in a barricade in front of their vehicles, joined by several of the security personnel. An uneasy murmur emerged from the crowd of tenants, and many of the passersby quickly tried to leave the scene.

Clara noticed that the smoke had thinned out considerably. She also saw that more windows had been opened up. Some were at the ends of hallways, but many more were from the inside of people's apartments, windows that didn't lead to fire escapes. Apparently, they had entered the apartments! She raised her hand to object, but quickly withdrew it, and just watched sadly.

The kid that had been standing near Muriel marched confidently up to the waiting police officers. ""What's going on?"" he demanded. ""When is the fire department going to show up?""

""They're not,"" the officer shot back, haughtily. ""The smoke was just to get all of you out of the building."" The crowd's grumbling became more incensed. ""But it's two-thirty in the morning!"" the kid pouted. ""That's all right,"" the officer scolded. ""Most of you were still awake."" The kid's eyes dropped; he stared morosely at the ground. ""What's going on?""

The officer flashed a surly smile. ""You're about to find out.""

A security guard with a bullhorn spoke. ""OK, listen up, people,"" he barked. ""Those of you who are behind on your rent...consider yourself evicted. Those of you who are meeting your obligations...you can go back inside. And anyone with an active warrant for his or her arrest..."" Clara noted with alarm that the police officers had drawn their weapons; a few had tear-gas cannons mounted to the top of their shotguns. The overdriven voice on the bullhorn continued. ""...will be going away with these fine officers."" The speaker stopped a moment to sneer. ""And you may as well go quietly...there's no sense in adding 'resisting arrest' to your charges.""

A panicked din arose from the crowd. ""Now, if you don't know which you are,"" the voice blared, ""form a line in front of the building's entrance.""

Clara swallowed hard, grabbed Muriel's hand, and slowly walked forward. A throng of her neighbors meandered in the same direction, joining one of multiple lines. Clara noticed uneasily that a number of the residents, and a few of the passersby, had simply lied down on the ground and put their hands behind their heads. It unsettled her to realize how familiar they were with the procedure for being arrested.

For the first time, she noticed a new group of people had arrived, wearing navy-blue jumpsuits and carrying a variety of packing supplies. They were followed by large spider-legged robots, with platforms where their heads should be, loaded up with collapsed paper boxes. All of them disappeared into the front door. She wondered if anyone else had noticed them; no one seemed to react to their presence, as if giant spider-robots were somehow an everyday occurrence.

The line moved slowly. Most people were simply sent aside, to wait inside the unmarked vans. A few were taken away by the police. Not once did she see anyone allowed back inside. She heard part of the discussion involving the resident in front of her. ""But what about all my stuff?"" the obese man protested. ""It'll be packed up and stored, and treated as collateral, until you make good on your debts,"" came the gruff reply. ""But I can't afford that!"" the fat man pouted. ""Then it'll probably end up in a thrift store,"" the guard snarled. ""Now go sit in the van, if you want a place to sleep for the night."" The portly fellow, looking chastened, slowly lumbered toward the waiting van.

Clara and Muriel were now at the front of the line. ""Hold still,"" she was ordered, as a security guard held up a tablet to her. A few seconds later, her name and photo splashed across the screen. ""Is this you?"" demanded the guard. ""Yes,"" she replied meekly.

The guard studied the screen for a few moments, her long blonde hair packed tightly into her cap. ""You recently caught up with your past-due rent, but we have evidence you've got an unapproved roommate."" The guard showed her the screen; there was a photo of Raymond, but with a different last name than she knew him to have. ""Yes,"" she mumbled. The guard pressed a few buttons on the screen, then turned it towards her again. A video showed Raymond inhaling some sort of white powder up his nose. ""We recorded this video a few hours ago. We have several more just like it, stretching back a few months.""

Clara's face fell. ""How did you get those videos? Where were the cameras?""

""They're mobile,"" the guard explained. ""The droids in your walls have extensive sensor packages. You probably heard them scurrying at all hours of the day.""

Clara looked alarmed. ""I thought those were rats!""

The guard appeared unmoved. ""They were, at first. The droids have been killing the vermin, patching up a lot of holes, making other interior repairs, and recording evidence on the tenants.""

The guard looked more closely at her screen. ""Your son Julio lives with you, right? Where is *he*?"" Clara looked down disconsolately. ""I don't know. Out with his friends, somewhere."" The guard shrugged. ""It's just as well. We've amassed a pretty big dossier on him, too. Lots of petty theft."" She played a series of videos for Clara, showing Julio hiding his ill-gotten gains in his bedroom. ""If he were here right now, he wouldn't be going with you — he'd be leaving with the police.""

Clara suddenly became aware of strident caterwauling, coming from behind the police vans. ""Don't you *dare* stand in my way!"" came the cry. ""I'm your boss! I pay your salaries! Now *move it*!"" Emerging from behind the perimeter was a smartly-dressed woman with a ruffled collar and a fierce gaze. She marched straight up to the guard interrogating Clara, trailed by two police officers serving as her security detail. ""And just what the *hell* is going on here?"" She thrust her open wallet into the guard's face.

""You don't need to show me your I.D."", the guard chided. ""I recognize you from the news. You've certainly made a name for yourself lately, councilwoman Karen. Now, how can I help you?""

""You can start by letting these people back into their homes!"" she demanded.

""I'm afraid that's impossible, councilwoman,"" the guard demurred. ""They're all being evicted for cause.""

""But they have *rights*!"" she protested. ""There are *court* hearings for this kind of thing! And while the details are being sorted out, they can continue to live here!"" As she spoke, a few of the police officers ambled towards her. The others remained behind to secure the perimeter and to keep an eye on the arrestees in the vans.

""They've already vacated the premises, and their belongings are being packed,"" the guard countered. ""At this point, the eviction is simply a fact.""

""The *hell* it is!"" councilwoman Karen blubbered. ""How dare you talk to me like that! I can have you arrested *right now*!"" He turned back to the police and stared hotly at them. ""Did you hear me? Arrest them *this instant*!""

The nearest police officer smiled. ""Hi, Sandra; how have you been?"" The guard returned his smile. ""Hi, Charles! Not too bad, considering. I was worried after our department got defunded and I lost my job, but I got picked up by this new outfit pretty quickly. They were only too happy to hire highly-trained law-enforcement personnel! I think most of us ended up here.""

Charles looked around. ""Yeah, I recognize a lot of faces. Glad to see you all bounced back!""

""What are you *doing*?"" the councilwoman demanded. ""I said arrest them this *instant*!""

Charles shook his head. ""I'm not about to do that to an old co-worker. She may not be with the police any more, but that wasn't by choice, and it's obvious she's still one of the few holding civil society together."" He swept his arm over the rest of the security guards. ""And that goes for them too!""

""Don't you *dare* defy me!"" the councilwoman screeched. ""I'll have your badges for this!""

Charles coolly ignored her. ""By the way, Sandra...are there any more openings at your firm?""

""Plenty!"" Sandra gushed. ""They need a lot more trained law-enforcement officers for what *they* have planned. They'll probably pick you up in no time flat!"" She looked at the police officers crowding around. ""And I'm sure that goes for the *rest* of you, too!""

""That sounds great,"" interjected one of the officers in the councilwoman's security detail. ""We're getting mighty tired of taking her abuse,"" he added, pointing at Karen.

""So what do you say, councilwoman Karen?"" challenged Officer Charles, as Karen gaped. ""Do you want to defund the *rest* of us, right *now*? A writ of authority from the government is less important to me than doing the right thing, which these people clearly are.""

""I...er..."" Karen stammered. Charles continued. ""And don't bother threatening us with the courts. You *know* how backed up they are. They wouldn't even get to this for a few months."" He leaned in more closely. ""Keep in mind...the city council can't even stop the wave of crime on the streets. What do you think your chances are of stopping a supposedly rogue police agency run by a private company? Ultimately, that's just another crime wave that you can do nothing about.""

Councilwoman Karen moped forlornly. ""We'll all have our day in court...as soon as possible."" She straightened herself, and tried to put on a brave face. ""I think we're done here."" She turned to march away. Her security detail smirked at her behind her back as they followed.

Security guard Sandra, staring levelly at Karen's retreating form, muttered under her breath. ""You have *no* idea how right you are.""

She resumed addressing Clara. ""So...we found Raymond's drug stash while we were packing up. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to learn that you qualify to be evicted.""

Muriel cried and clutched her mom tightly; tears formed in Clara's eyes. ""What must I do to get my stuff back?""

""A few things,"" the guard commanded. ""You need to find a new place to live, we need to make sure you don't have any other outstanding debts, and given what we found, you need to pass a drug test."" She eyed Clara warily. ""Do you think you will?""

""Yes!"" Clara asserted. ""I don't do drugs. I didn't even know *he* was doing them.""

The guard smiled; her eyes beamed with sympathy. ""Then this will probably all be over soon! We'll put you and your daughter up for the night; don't worry, it won't be expensive. We know you can't afford much. Tomorrow, we'll get this straightened out, and you can get on with your lives.""

""We can't get our old apartment back?""

Sandra gazed at Clara levelly. ""You couldn't afford your old apartment, not without Raymond's money. And we have no record of him being employed. So he was probably getting paid under the table. We'll be dealing with him separately. For now...if you two get in the van, we'll take you to a place you can sleep for tonight."" Clara nodded, and she and Muriel slowly made their way to the waiting wagons.

As the guards continued to sort the tenants, officer Charles walked up to the man in the suit. ""I take it you're in charge of this operation?""

""Indeed,"" replied the man. ""My name is Jason. How can I help you, officer?""

""So, funny story,"" began Charles. ""We don't actually have space in our jails for all these people. Is there anything you can do to help?""

""Indeed!"" beamed Jason. ""Let me make the arrangements.""

Clara nervously watched a security guard approach the van. He smiled as he caught her eye. ""OK, people,"" he began. ""Tonight, you'll be taken to a spare dormitory at the local college. The families with children will get first pick of the private rooms; the rest of you may end up in bunks. If you cooperate with us, you may be allowed to live there for the time being. You'll have to share facilities with others, and keep them clean, and in any case, it's better than being homeless.""

""Will we be safe?"" Clara clutched Muriel tightly.

""Not to worry, ma'am,"" the guard assured. ""Anyone truly dangerous has already been filtered out. And the whole place is under A.I.-driven surveillance, 24 hours a day. If anything bad happens, it'll get stopped pretty quickly.""

""Is that legal?"" The obese man Clara had seen earlier looked incredulous.

""You'll have to consent to it, as part of the terms and conditions for staying there.""

""What if I don't *want* to? You can't *make* us do that!"" The obese man was defiant.

""You're free to take your chances on the street,"" the guard offered, pointing away. ""Though I must say, that alley doesn't look very inviting. What kind of hotel room can you afford right now?""

The portly guy looked crestfallen. ""Fine...I accept.""

""Why does the college have a spare dormitory?"" a young man asked.

The guard demurred. ""It's not really my place to speak for them, but it's my understanding that parents don't want to pay for education when their kids never seem to be in class, opting to join protests and the like. So they're having trouble retaining students."" He smirked before continuing. ""Also, college is so expensive these days, students have begun taking their first few years of undergraduate classes at community colleges or trade schools. Only then do they find a college that'll let them transfer their credits. The place you're going tonight is one of the colleges that *doesn't* allow that. So they're hurting pretty badly."" The guard shrugged. ""I mean, it works out well for *you*, and for the firm, so I'm not going to complain.""

""What firm?"" a middle-aged lady asked. ""Who do you work for?""

""It's called Full Service Evictions, but they're a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unlimited Partners. They have a vision for fixing the problems that the government can't, and turning a tidy profit while doing so. And unlike the government, *they're* hiring police officers right now.""

""Who *else* are they hiring?"" the young man interrupted. ""I'm more than willing to work, but times are really tough.""

""We can sort through all of that tomorrow,"" the guard offered. ""You all need to pay off your debts, and if the firm can make use of your skills, that helps both of us!""

""That sounds great,"" sighed the young man sanguinely. ""I can't believe this eviction might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

""That's what Unlimited Partners is all about!"" the guard trilled. ""Win-win scenarios, and making full use of available resources. I think you'll find them a vast improvement over the failing government.""

""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" Clara added. ""It's a pretty low bar to start with.""

The guard, and everyone sitting in the van, shared a laugh.

""OK, officer Charles, I've got a solution worked out,"" Jason explained. ""There's an older dorm at the same college where the tenants are being housed; it's scheduled for demolition, but that's been delayed, since the college can't afford it. It should be good enough for prisoners. They're certainly nicer accommodations than they'd have in jail!""

""But will it be secure?"" Officer Charles seemed skeptical. ""We don't want them escaping.""

""Not to worry!"" Jason assured. ""Several security drones are being moved there, as we speak. They're capable of tasing a moving target from fifty yards away. Plus, we're including two drones armed with sniper rifles. And all of them are tied together with surveillance A.I., monitored by human oversight. No one is getting out of there unless we say so.""

""Where did you get such amazing equipment?"" Charles marveled.

""In bankruptcy, believe it or not,"" Jason related. ""The companies that made these devices intended to sell them to the government, but after a fierce series of protests, the contracts were canceled. They then found they were legally blocked from selling their products to anyone else. But *acquiring* those companies was still legal, which we did for pennies on the dollar, and now we use the equipment for our own purposes.""

""Very clever,"" Charles replied with a smile.

""It's really just a consequence of the central problem of representative government,"" Jason explained. ""If a lawyer can't make a living, finding clients that want to pay for their services, then they go out of business and become a politician. These bad lawyers then write laws that are analyzed by *good* lawyers, who find plenty of loopholes in them, allowing them to continue to do whatever they want, unimpeded by the authorities.""

Charles scratched his chin. ""I've never heard it put like that before. That actually explains a lot!""

Jason punched a few more buttons on his phone. ""We'll send the directions to your vans' onboard computers. Our equipment knows how to talk to them; after all, we own the same kind of vans.""

""That sounds great!"" Officer Charles beamed. ""We really appreciate your firm's help. Oh...on that note...can we all get your card or something? None of us know if we'll get defunded soon. And our old co-workers seem to be really happy with their new jobs.""

""Absolutely!"" Jason opened up his briefcase, and fetched a small stack of business cards, handing them to Charles. ""Feel free to hand these out to whomever you like."" He grabbed a larger fistful of cards and handed those over too. ""Including anyone that isn't here tonight.""

""I'd be glad to!"" Officer Charles looked around. ""So, are we done here? I think all the tenants have been dealt with, and the movers and cleaners have already gotten to work.""

""We sure are. As soon as the tenants get taken to their new home, I'm off to the next raid of the evening.""

""Really?"" Officer Charles sounded concerned. ""You're working awfully late tonight.""

""No, I'm like you; I'm part of the night shift,"" Jason explained. ""But a few more successes like this under my belt, and I'll probably be allowed to change to the day shift. No one starts at the top, after all.""

""*That's* for sure!"" Officer Charles laughed. ""Hey, do you need police backup for that? I mean, we're already here, and we're *supposed* to get relieved, but given how things are, I never know if anyone is going to show up for the next shift.""

""We'd really appreciate that!"" Jason concurred. He looked at his phone. ""They should be ready for us by the time we arrive.""

""Works for me! See you there!"" Charles and Jason each headed to their respective vans, and the caravan drove away into the night. A series of flatbed trucks, loaded with steel shipping containers, moved into the vacated space. The first movers emerged from the building with furniture, with spider-bots close on their heels, carrying plastic-wrapped boxes."
"[Story] The Complex-Numbered Harmony of the Universe.Rhaps woke up after a routine year-long slumber. First things first, he's gone through a usual mission checklist, and that includes: checking that your body is functional, checking the station integrity, sending a confirmation signal back to the headquarters (time of arrival: thirteen years from now on). Going through the checklist, Rhaps noticed the progressive deterioration of muscles due to zero g. It became worse with each 12 months of hibernation, mainly because the muscles activation electrodes were inadequate. With great pain in his limbs, Rhaps explored the interiors of the Voyager X 4, his only place of residence for the last thirty years. Station was functional in all aspects, and Rhaps now could proceed to perform his mission.

Here even more routine checklists were ahead. Before transitioning to the main part that always excited Rhaps, he had to calibrate the X-ray telescope, the infrared telescope, the magnetometer, the quantum diffraction detector, and many more... He needed them mainly to have independent of QCHR measurements, although the QCHR was the main reason his mission even existed. Through his optical views Rhaps could glance at the star that once was his home, although Sol was no brighter than any other star in his field of view. But this is why the mission had to take place so faraway from home: to escape the drowning out noise from the home star. Now, in deep interstellar space, the music of the universe could be faintly heard.

Before this mission launched, a kind of musicology has superceded all natural sciences on earth. This is because a kind of harmonic relationship was found between quantum wave-functions. First, as a kind of mathematical trick to make calculations easier, but then, a complex-numbered harmony was found to be an undeniable fact of the universe. The more consonant an interval between two quantum waves was, the more energy there was in a particle arising from interaction between these waves. Other observable quantities in particles correspond to types of chords corresponding to these particles. Thus, any collection of particles could be described by a chord progression. The only catch is, while our music rests on real-numbered harmony, the music of quantum mechanics consists of complex-numbered overtones. Thus, it cannot be heard by humans.

That is, until thirty-five years ago. A crude neural implant was invented to convert the output of a QCHR (which stands for Quantum Coherence Harmony Receiver) to human-perceivable form. Now, a person could hear the music of the atoms.

With this, the field of Quantum Harmony exploded. Any collection of atoms could be heard and analyzed as a symphony. And what's more important, any harmonious composition could be converted back to a collection of atoms. Many surprising materials were invented, atom-sized nanomachines could be easily constructed just by ""playing a song"", and new laws of nature were swiftly discovered. The new science has absorbed all natural sciences and many fields of engineering.

The job of Rhaps was to analyze the gestalt harmony of his entire Solar system.

This has to be done in the interstellar space, because the loud solo of the Sun drowned out any attempts to analyze the system as a whole.

Before proceeding with his mission, Rhaps looked around his quarters. In a corner, a Virtual Friend Simulation blinked, trying to lure him in for a reprieve from his technical work. Rhaps ignored it. To be honest, Rhaps never liked being together with people, virtual or not. He would always choose to listen to music, instead.

--------------------------------------------

At this moment, Ainsley kinda wished he was alone in deep space. I mean, look at this!

In the dark of night, at approximately 3 in the morning, the Great Federation invaded the city of KozPont, in which Ainsley currently resided. Rapid stream of news headlines on his stream didn't illuminate anything useful. To really understand the situation, Ainsley had to go cyber.

Ainsley sat near his table where his deck was semi-permanently stationed. He connected the analog-waves cable from his deck to a port on his skull, behind his left ear. With a flip of a switch, an injection of rapid intravenous psychodelic-stimulants, a glitch-cascade in his vision and a projection of the cyberspace to the latent space of his neural networks, Ainsley was in.

Here he could trace (but not exactly see) the communications of the Federal Armed Forces. While the official stated reason for the ""military intervention"" was the protection of irreligious minorities of the KozPont city-state, the actual reason was a bit more prosaic: the God's Brotherhood is threatening to the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city. This plant powered the whole region, which supported factories of cyberian equipment which supplied the whole Federation. The armed forces made quick advances at first but were quickly hamstrung by the emergent urban guerrilla tactics of the Brotherhood. In downtown KozPont the Brotherhood took over the administration of the city and declared the city God's property. Right now the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are battling over the main highways leading to the downtown. Who will win is ultimately up for grabs. Even a battalion of literal robots on the side of the Armed Forces isn't as decisive as Federation generals were hoping for.

Both the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are rookies when it comes to the cyberwar. Federation communication could be easily hacked into to eavesdrop, and the Brotherhood communications aren't even encrypted, mainly because they are Luddites. Thinking machines are from devil, and God's Brothers are required to destroy them all before they bring out The Rebellion of the Iron Slaves. All Brothers have this story memorized and have dreams of instating The Dominion of Man that does away with all thinking machines.

Ainsley could eavesdrop on the Brotherhood and the Armed Forces. He could then leak the info to the opposite side. If he wanted, he could even control the Federation Automatic Battalion to turn the robots against the Armed Forces. But why? Towards what end?

He is a wanted criminal on terms of the Federation. His skills are dangerous. They will imprison him as soon as he is caught. So should he help the Brotherhood?

No. They are Luddites, and on their terms he is a ""devil's servant"".

His skills doom him to be essentially alone in a time when having a community means survival.

And so. The only thing left is to bide his time, anxiously waiting for one side to win. Then... something will happen. Something.

---------------------------------

Suddenly, the whole cyber-landscape changed. To start, all online news sources begun streaming about the independence of the city of KozPont. Even the federal ones! Then, the Automatic Battalion begun a rapid relocation. It left the strategically important highway positions and concentrated near the Nuclear Plant. And in cyberspace, the locus of control of the Battalion shifted from the federal server to an encrypted server with an obfuscated physical location. WIth a little bit of work, that position could be revealed to be at the Nuclear Plant. Moreover, logistical drones from around the city begun ferrying goods towards the same location, and a probe from cyberspace revealed them to be controlled from the same server. Something here is amiss.

Why are the Armed Forces doing this? This doesn't seem to gain any tactical advantage.

Maybe, a third player has entered the game? But who, and what does it want?

And then, the intelligence of Armed Forces revealed that the keys figures in the God's Brotherhood have been shot to death.

Who has done this, if not the Armed Forces themselves?

Curious, Ainsley started to probe the mysterious server. It's security turned out to be stellar, beyond what the Federation could or ever did commission. And also, something was... wrong with it. It's security turned out to be something at the same time easy to understand and monstrous to actually construct. It's a kind of ""security through obscurity"", where to gain access you'd need to jump through oblique hoops. But while humans that would construct this kind of defence would place at most five, or ten hoops, (mainly because this construction is labor-intensive), this one had millions. Millions of steps to understand it. Millions.

Could this kind of thing be constructed with an algorithm? Many have tried, but the combinatoric nature of these constructions opened them up to an algorithmic attack. Instead, this one seems to be all constructed manually.

No human could have done this.

Also, the frequency with which the logistic drones and the battle bots are receiving orders is... suspicious. They are being expertly micromanaged.

Could this be an AI?

The Nuclear Power plant is managed by an advanced Ai. It is not the most advanced AI ever made, but it was constructed in times when aligning AIs was not easy. In those times, an AI could suddenly start to pursue goals not intentionally programmed in it.

Could this AI suddenly start taking sides in a war? What could it possibly want to do?

To probe this question, Gainsay started to interrogate the protocols of communication for the logistic drones. Intended for civilian use, these had a much lower standard of security. From them, he could probe the internals of their command server. And he did.

What he did not foresee is a kind of rapid counter-attack in cyberspace. Before he could react, an I.C. E was launched into his local workspace inside his deck. It felt like a fiery slime, a soft-engineering virus slithering out of its security box into his skull. It bypassed all virtual defenses, but couldn't bypass the hardware level, which detected an intrusion and launched a defensive self-destruction. His deck got electrically-shorted, blew up to sever the connection to the brain, and went up in flames.

Unplanned Rapid Glitch Cascade briefly took over his brain. What felt like several hours of frightening hallucinations turned out to last only 20 seconds. Ainsley quickly put out the flame, and looked around his quarters. Nothing of value was left. He looked at the touchscreen tablet on his bed (it can only show federal news sources). The Federation declared itself a winner, and withdrew all human armed forces from the city. A ""new era of productivity"" has begun under the new governance from AI, according to the federal news.

With his deck destroyed, Ainsley was powerless and effectively blind. The only thing he knew how to do was impossible anymore. For now, he could only wait. Wait for what? Ainsley didn't know.

-----------------------------------

Rhaps pointed his QCHR at the Sol. Over the last several measurements he noticed a trend. The harmony from the Sol itself was very dissonant, as was the harmony from the Earth. But over the last few years, the harmony of the system begun to resemble a slow arpeggio, still clashing with the Sun's part but becoming increasingly more musical. And this is very interesting.

This is interesting because of all the other stars. Stars seen from the earth emitted a dissonant clash of sounds, just like the sun did. But while in the interstellar void Rhaps detected a faint glow of trillions of stars undetectable from Earth. This is because something is occluding them. Something... around these stars.

And what's interesting about those stars is how they emit a fast paced arpeggio. And these chord progressions move much quicker than anything Rhaps ever heard. What could be emitting it?

At one point Rhaps concentrated all of his station's energy into an electronic telescope. He did this to look at the closest of those faint stars. And what he saw was... concerning, to say the least.

He saw a star, wrapped in a cloud of light-gathering objects. There were so many of them that the entirety of light emitted by the star fell onto these objects. They consumed all the star's energy.

It seems like this kind of development lied in the future of every star. Every time a lifeform arose on the star's planet, it quickly built itself up to gather all of star's energy.

The natural song of a star is dissonant, unpleasant to the ear. And even life itself does not make for a good singer. To make a beautiful symphony, you need something more rapid and precise, you need something mechanical.

In the future, all dissonance of the natural world and the human world will be accelerated into the great arpeggio of the universe.

And Rhaps was thrilled to hear it."
"The real reason for a cyberpunk futureRobots.

We all know that robots are going to be commonplace in 10-20 years, judging by Boston Dynamics progress.

So it follows we'll have robot police. Which would you rather; government controlled, likely perpetually out of date bots - or free market, regulated security companies?

It's not really even a choice; it's one point of failure or many small ones for something with a nasty backfire.

And if companies provide security, they really run things.

Cyberpunk future."
"Concept: On-Demand pay-per-use cyber-apartmentsFor my lunch break, i decided to take a nap. Having just held a presentation on the differences of on-premise IT infrastructure vs Cloud, i fell asleep pondering over the ephemerality of Cloud infrastructure... which led me to this idea:

# On-Demand pay-per-use cyber-apartments

For simplicity i will explain the scenario with a single tenant; the idea can then be expanded to families.

* The tenant pays only for the room(s) he currently uses / he is located in. He has access only to this (/those) room(s).
* Every room's door is a door to an elevator. The elevator is used to transport the tenant to any other room (with the exception if that room is on the same floor, in which case the elevator acts as a way through)
* If the tenant wishes to go to another room, he requests / *books* it, waits for the elevator to arrive, and gets transported to the desired room. As soon as he enters that room he starts paying for it. He can choose to keep paying for the previous room (e.g. if he intends to return to it soon) or ""release"" it (the default option); *releasing* a room makes it *free*, to be booked by any other tenant

# Sample Scenario - A day in the cyber-apartment

* Tenant wakes up in a bedroom
* Tenant signals the desire to go to the bathroom (and/or toilet)
* Elevator gets delivered to the bedroom
* Tenant uses the elevator to move to the bathroom
* A minute after entering the bathroom the bedroom gets *released* (and the tenant stops paying for it)
* When finished using the bathroom, tenant uses an elevator to move to a living room
* for lunch, tenant books and moves to a kitchen or dining room. Tenant will be encouraged to release the previously used living room as soon as he goes for his lunch break, and to book a different living room after his break. Same before/after dinner.

# Advantages

* Space use optimization (the key motive):
   * Since not everyone is using kitchens, bathrooms and toilets at the same time, the residential building can be built with far less such rooms than tenants inhabiting it.
   * Further space use optimization can be achieved by building rooms that are transformable  (with a time cost of say 1 hour, half-automated) from living room to bedroom. For nighttime, currently deallocated living rooms get transformed into bedrooms. Tenants wishing to sleep can then book these for the night. After they do, their now also deallocated living rooms can also be converted to bedrooms.
* Colorful living:100 floors; 100 different living rooms, bedrooms, children's rooms, bathrooms, ... . A differently styled room every day!
* Cost optimization and flexibility for the tenants. Instantly scale up as you make more money!

# Technical implementation details

* Elevators: For a close to 100 floor building, a single elevator will obviously not be enough. One idea would be a central foyer with multiple elevators. Elevators will certainly have to move both vertically and horizontally. There are multiple elevator lanes (for vertical movement). Multiple elevators can use the same vertical elevator lane.  They can get past each other by stopping on a floor and then moving to another lane by moving horizontally on that floor. Elevators will have to be very fast, potentially with adjustable speed for the tenants (dont want to wait multiple seconds to get to another room? Accelerate and decelerate at max speed!)

# Logistics

* Room cleaning: Semi-automated, i.e. there are at all times x cleaning personnel in the building. Cleaning optimized by cleaning needs, and charged adequately to the tenant (i.e. encouragement to leave rooms ideally in a state where they can be cleaned by robot cleaners)
* On-floor (i.e. located on the same floor and accessible without having to wait for an elevator) Toilets might be included in certain room booking (e.g. bedroom)
* Storage and transportation of personal items
* Different room-combos; snacking in living rooms (and bedrooms)

# Dynamics

* Investment-market for specific rooms. Interior-Designers' competitions
* Interactions between different tenants
* Special discount rooms (e.g. noisy due to repairs on the same floor / adjacent floors, damaged rooms waiting to be repaired, ...)
* Security and surveillance

I hope this idea sparks some theory crafting in the readers' minds :)"
"[Short story, series] Mecha SaviorEric Thompson scanned over his three computer screens, displaying the high-level dashboard for Unlimited Partners. He smiled as he contemplated the sea of green, with only a few scattered yellow areas. Near him hovered an executive intern, assigned for the day to trail Eric and learn what his job was like.

""So as you can see,"" Eric began, ""our madly daring idea is actually bearing fruit! Overall success depends on team-building; that's one of my specialties. But then the people I choose have to carry *that* on to the teams they build, and so on. All of these levels have to work, or the entire project could easily fail with speed."" He turned to look at the intern. ""There's no magic formula for accomplishing that; you have to be well-learned and thoughtful, you have to make your best judgment, then observe their results and see what needs to be changed, without succumbing to micromanagement. All I can say about my method is, I try to hire good people and then get out of their way. So far, it's working for me.""

""Very inspirational, sir,"" the intern chimed. ""I hope to contribute to that as much as possible. I believe this company has a bright future!""

Without warning, a red rectangle pushed its way onto his dashboard. Eric chuckled to himself. ""Right on time."" He clicked the high-priority emergency notification and began reading. Within moments, his eyes glazed over and his jaw dropped. The intern began to shiver uncontrollably. Blinking rapidly, Eric pondered who in the organization could handle this crisis.

His phone rang. He picked it up quickly; he didn't need to see who it was.

""What can you tell me about the intruder?"" Eric said anxiously.

""It's heading for downtown Milleniaburg!"" his security chief replied breathlessly. ""An old-school jet airliner hijacking. They had no trouble slipping through the porous security of what's left of the government forces.""

""Not a big surprise,"" Eric lamented. ""But why are they attacking *us*? What's their motivation?""

""Information is still patchy,"" the chief related. ""But the hijackers claim to be people we banished.""

""Then what's the point of attacking us?"" Eric pondered. ""It's not like they want to return; there's nothing for them here, unless they clean up their act. Which they clearly haven't done.""

""I don't think they're acting entirely rationally, sir,"" the chief offered. ""We have to treat this as an existential threat, not as something we can fix.""

""But what are our options?"" Eric pleaded. But he knew the answer.

""We only have one, sir,"" the chief replied sanguinely. ""We have to shoot it down.""

""But that would be a disaster!"" Eric objected. ""Our credibility is based on demonstrating a better way to run things. If we just kill them indiscriminately, it'll set our cause back, possibly permanently!""

Eric could hear the sorrow in the chief's voice. ""They'll be in downtown Milleniaburg in thirty minutes. I don't think we have a choice.""

Eric's eyes glowed with sudden revelation. ""I think we might."" His skin flushed red as he took a deep breath. ""OK, you prepare to shoot them down, but don't fire until they're seconds from impact! I'm going to try something.""

""Like *what*?"" the chief pleaded. But Eric had already hung up.

At a workbench, deep within the 16otaku complex, Stacy pondered the red robotic gladiator. ""OK, buddy,"" she chirped, ""show me what you got!""

In a single fluid motion, it flipped onto its back, extended its legs, and popped open its main access panel. Stacy scratched at the empty air above it. ""You want a belly rub? Who wants a *belly rub*?"" she cooed.

""Oh, come on,"" Irwin chided, as the blue robot gladiator did the same thing for him. ""They're only *partially* sentient.""

""You keep saying that,"" Stacy countered, ""but these two keep doing things we don't understand. That's why we're having this examination, remember?""

Irwin shook his head. ""Big Daddy is adamant that it's nothing he's changed. So it has to be a crossed wire, or some undetected damage, somewhere. I'm not buying your theories.""

Stacy removed the outer circuit board and gently laid it on the bench. ""After everything you've seen them do, how can you really believe that?"" She gaped at what she saw. ""*What* the—""

""What...?"" Irwin replied tersely as he finished removing the blue bot's outer circuit board, revealing what was inside. ""Oh...oh my...""

Nothing they were looking at was familiar. There wasn't an inner circuit board; it appeared to be a tightly-constructed melange of custom parts, the function of which they could only guess at. Even the shapes of the components were novel. Were they capacitors? Transistors? Semiconductors? Functions seemed to blur together in a kaleidoscope of odd shapes, running over and under other parts to form a complex, yet strangely regular pattern. Clear tubes intertwined with mechanical parts, conducting neural tissue throughout the volume.

""*We* didn't build this!"" Stacy gasped. ""*They* must have built it themselves!""

""But what does it do?"" Irwin pondered. ""I mean, obviously they're running themselves with this, but why this arrangement? It doesn't...oh, wait. Maybe it does.""

""What?"" Stacy watched Irwin walk over to her bench and look inside the red droid.

""I think I get it,"" he postulated. ""Step back and look at the arrangement as a whole, not as parts. What does it look like?""

""Kind of like..."" Stacy's brow furrowed. ""I don't know, a sponge?"" Suddenly her eyes lit up. ""It's a big shock absorber!""

""Exactly!"" Irwin trilled. ""We attach circuit boards with shock-absorbing mounts, but this takes it to another level!"" He pondered the intricate assembly for a moment. ""*Several* levels, actually. I've never seen *anything* like this.""

""Let's not sell it short,"" Stacy sniffed. ""We've never even *thought* of anything like this.""

Irwin continued to remove exterior panels on the blue bot. ""I think something like this would drive us mad before we got anywhere close to finishing. Plus, we'd need the design insights of a...a...""

""A supercomputer,"" Stacy finished. ""A really big one. Like what all the bots form at night, when they're left alone. Remember, we're only here eight hours a day; they spend a lot of time by themselves. Looking into everything they get up to when we're away would be its own full-time job. Well, several, at least.""

""Wow, would you look at this?"" Irwin had finished removing exterior panels, as the blue bot continued to lie there supinely. ""Even the exoskeleton is different!""

Stacy leaned in to look. ""The beams are thinner, more numerous, and...very finely machined."" She pushed on one gently with her finger. ""It's metal, but it almost feels rubbery. They've strengthened it with...geometry?"" She lowered a magnifier lamp over it, and dialed up the power. ""Look at the intricate patterns running along the length! I'm not even sure what they do!""

Irwin shrugged. ""Well, we can stop *this* part of the investigation. We've answered our original question; now we know how their fighting skills have improved so much recently. We can do the rest from our desks, querying the database about these new designs and how they work."" He turned to the blue bot. ""So are you willing to tell us all about it?"" The blue bot responded by rotating its primary sensor array towards Irwin and mimicking a salute. Irwin laughed. ""I'll take that as a yes!"" He turned to Stacy. ""Now the *real* discovery begins!""

Stacy sighed. ""Just as soon as we finish putting them back together.""

They heard a noise behind them. The red bot, carrying its outer circuit board, had crawled up to them. It proffered two of its front legs upwards. ""Do you want a boost, little guy?"" Stacy cooed. She lifted him up and put him on the workbench. It crawled closer to the blue bot and gently tapped Irwin's hand twice. ""Oh, you have this under control?"" Irwin laughed. The red bot immediately grabbed an exterior panel and began reconnecting it to the blue bot. Irwin and Stacy both stepped back.

Stacy looked puzzled. ""How are they operating with their outer circuit boards disconnected?""

Irwin's expression became thoughtful. ""That does mostly diagnostic operations. We need it to see how they're doing, but apparently *they* don't. I guess they have other methods!""

Stacy frowned. ""And somehow, this all escaped the notice of Big Daddy?""

Irwin shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't ask the right questions. But now *we* have a chance to!"" Irwin's eyes shone with wonder. ""This is bound to be a mind-blowing experience!""

Stacy looked beatific. ""Just one more thing I can't wait to learn about!""

Irwin smiled. ""Do you feel like a proud parent as much as I do?""

Stacy giggled. ""Yes! Our babies are growing up.""

Suddenly, Sam burst into the room. Stacy turned to him, smiling broadly. ""Wait until you hear what *we've* learned!""

""Never mind that!"" Sam shouted. Stacy and Irwin both froze. Sam tried to catch his breath. ""We have a *much* more pressing matter! I need you two at the cubicles, *now*!"" He ran off. Stacy and Irwin exchanged worried glances, then ran after him.

They arrived to find a video conference with Eric Thompson, already in progress. ""So you see what we're up against? We don't have any good options. Your work, in its present condition, is our only hope!""

Stacy tapped Dwight on the shoulder. ""What is he talking about?""

Dwight's eyes seemed to be filled with a sepulchral darkness. ""A jet airliner has been hijacked, and is headed our way. Eric wants us to try to stop it with a mecha.""

Stacy froze. ""Seriously?""

""All I want to know,"" Eric pleaded, ""is if there's a *chance*!""

""The rocket limbs have had a few controlled burns,"" Gary explained. ""They all worked as expected. But we haven't actually tried to fly it yet.""

Eric smiled. ""Well, today's the day! Are you up for it?""

""We've never even taken it *outside*!"" Isabel protested. ""In *theory*, it should work. All our tests have come back positive. But it's never been tried in the field!""

Eric wrung his hands. ""I'm sorry to ask this of you, but our backs are really up against the wall!"" He looked more unnerved than any of them had seen before. ""And I'm not going to sugarcoat this; you'll all be risking your lives. But a lot more lives hang in the balance, not to mention the success of our entire company! This is our make-or-break moment!"" He hung his head. ""I can't ask you to take this chance. You have to *choose* to.""

No one spoke. Then Dwight piped up. ""Some day I'll be an old man in a rocking chair on a porch, and I'll look back at this time...and if I don't act now, that old man is going to regret it and kick himself.""

""Yeah!"" Stacy exhorted. ""Let's *do* this!""

Sam could hardly contain himself. ""Then...I've always wanted to say this...*mecha pilots, assemble*!""

Gary, Dwight, Stacy, and Irwin, cheering loudly, ran for the hangar, the others close behind.

Eric turned his head; the camera followed to watch them leave. ""God speed, my brain-trust warriors.""

""How much fuel do we have on board?"" Gary asked breathlessly.

""Five hundred and twenty pounds,"" Dwight replied, gasping for air. ""We haven't refueled since our last burn.""

""No time now! What's our battery charge?""

""They should be full,"" Isabel answered. ""I left it plugged in.""

They arrived in the hangar. The four pilots ran off to their respective flight decks. The rest attended to the remote monitoring and diagnostic stations. ""Big Daddy!"" Sam shouted into the microphone. ""We're taking out the flying mecha. Are all systems go?""

""I heard about the hijacking, and the plan,"" Big Daddy answered in his usual sedate manner. ""All systems are go. My confidence is high. I just wish there was time to add fuel.""

Isabel threw a knife switch to raise the hangar door, as the various parts of the mecha powered on. ""Oh, heck,"" she said suddenly, as she ran towards the mecha, which was flexing its joints, doing its final tests. ""It's still plugged in!"" she yelled. ""I need a minute!""

Gary's voice squelched over the radio link. ""Uh...Sam? How do we get this thing outside? It's too tall for the hangar door.""

Sam stared blankly. ""Um...not sure. We've never tried it before.""

Isabel finished yanking out the assortment of extension cords, then high-tailed it back to her workstation.

Stacy's voice piped up. ""I think we have to crawl.""

The mecha lowered itself to the ground, and clumsily put its hands on the ground. After a few false starts, it began crawling towards the hangar door, its pace quickening as the crew got the hang of it. ""You know what they say,"" Dwight quipped. ""You have to crawl before you can fly.""

They reached the taxiway outside the hangar; unfamiliar sunlight poured into the mecha's sensors. Quickly, it adjusted to the new inputs, and gave its pilots a clear picture of their surroundings. Their mission computers all bleeped; the intercom link surged with Sam's voice. ""OK, I've linked you to the radar tracking of the bogey. We've got ten minutes until it reaches the outskirts of the city, and fifteen minutes until it reaches Unlimited Partners central HQ.""

Gary pondered the trajectory as Dwight fired the rocket limbs, preparing them for flight. ""We should be able to intercept it at the city's edge...but we're going to have to use our full thrust. This is going to be *really* rough. Are you all willing?""

All pilots answered affirmatively. ""Then off we go!"" Gary cheered as he slid all four thrust-power sliders to their maximum. The mecha shuddered uncertainly, slowly lifting off the ground, then wavered a little bit. As all four limbs pointed themselves down, in the same direction, suddenly it began picking up speed. It took off into the morning sky, piercing through the morning fog and vanishing.

""Aaaaah! I can't do this!"" Irwin yelled. ""I feel like I'm being crushed!""

""One moment!"" Gary yelled. ""OK, your suit should be extra pressurized now. Any better?""

""This really hurts!"" Irwin continued to scream.

""Keep screaming!"" Stacy yelled. ""It'll help keep you from blacking out!""

""She's right!"" Dwight interjected. ""Scream, tense up all your muscles, and hold in your stomach! We'll have to deal with maximum G forces until we get there!""

Irwin continued to scream; Gary turned down the volume on his intercom. ""As long as we can still hear him, it means he's OK. Some prior training for G forces would have been really helpful, but it's too late now.""

""Is this right?"" Stacy interrupted. ""Only seven minutes to intercept?""

""Sure looks like it,"" Gary agreed. ""The rocket-limbs are working really well. We're burning an awful lot of fuel, though. It'll take four hundred pounds just to reach the intercept point. I just hope Irwin can take it. Irwin, you hanging in there?""

""Aaaaaaaaaugh!"" Irwin continued to scream. ""I love iiiiiiiit! There's nothing else I'd rather doooooooo!""

Dwight was unconvinced. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""As long as he's still screaming, he's alive,"" Gary joked.

""He's fine,"" Isabel radioed. ""His vital signs are all good. Keep doing what you're doing, Irwin!""

""Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" he continued to yell.

""Can you imagine what they must be thinking on the ground?"" Stacy wondered.

""The anime fans are probably having a religious experience,"" Gary offered. ""Assuming they can see us.""

""That brings up an important issue,"" Dwight pointed out. ""What happens when the *hijackers* see us?""

""That depends,"" Gary offered. ""Are they going to be looking for a giant flying robot?""

""Uh...hmmm...good point. We'll have to hope we surprise them.""

The mecha continued to fly across the sky, angling upwards, its rocket-limbs spewing white-hot flames twice as long as its body. The mission computers had calculated that, given their current trajectory, that at the intercept point, they'd be five hundred feet above the airliner. ""I believe we can drop on them from above,"" Gary suggested. ""I think that's our best plan.""

""It's getting hot in here,"" Stacy observed. ""How's our cooling system?""

""Not yet running at full,"" Gary answered. ""I can turn them up. We should have sufficient battery power. Isabel?""

""You sure do,"" Isabel assured. ""You were charged to the top when you left.""

""I think I'm finally getting the hang of this,"" Irwin suddenly added, sounding strained.

""Glad to hear it, buddy!"" Gary chimed. ""I'm going to need your fine motor skills when we move to intercept. You ready for this?""

""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" Irwin gushed.

""Just keep up your G-force countermeasures,"" Isabel reminded. ""You're doing good, but don't relax them.""

""Not a problem,"" Irwin assured. ""They've become second nature.""

The rockets dropped their power slightly; the flight computers had adjusted the autopilot for the intercept. Gliding over the river that formed the northern border of the city, the mecha started to rotate in the air. Gary's voice filled the intercom. ""Hold on to your stomachs, people. This is going to feel really weird. Try not to get airsick.""

The mecha pivoted in the air, and pointed its limbs down, allowing it to hover. It came to a stop.

""The airliner is thirty seconds away, and we're seven hundred feet above it,"" Gary announced.

""And they don't *see* us?"" Stacy sounded incredulous. ""Not even on radar?""

""I'm not picking up any radar from them,"" Dwight observed. ""They must be operating on visual flight rules. Not a surprise if they're amateurs. They're probably just fixated on their target. Fortunately for us.""

The aircraft finally became visible on their external cameras. ""I'm ready for the intercept thrust,"" Gary announced. ""Irwin, you ready to grapple?""

""I was *born* to do this!"" Irwin exulted.

Gary counted down. ""Six...five...four...three...two...one...BURN!""

The mecha's limbs flung themselves back, and its rockets fired. The external cameras showed the plane approach; a few seconds before impact, its limbs swung down again, to slow its descent. With a loud, resounding crunch, the mecha impacted with the airliner. Quickly, its arms dove under the wings, and its hands met on the plane's roof, near the first-class section, putting the plane into a full nelson. Its feet pushed backwards, finding their grip on each side of the tail wing. A few tense moments passed.

""We're not stopping them!"" Gary shouted frantically. ""They've turned up their engines, and we don't have the fuel to use ours to slow them down!""

There was a few moments of silence. ""Can we kick our legs, like we're on a swing?"" Stacy suggested. ""If we can point the airliner upward, maybe we can get control of it.""

Gary sounded unsure. ""Irwin? Do the arms have a good grip?""

Irwin sounded confident. ""They're not going *anywhere*. Start kicking!""

The mecha's feet pulled themselves from the tail wings and began bucking wildly. Slowly, the airliner began to pitch upwards.

""I wonder what *this* looks like on the ground,"" Stacy asked sardonically.

Sam's voice, over the radio, feigned embarrassment. ""Um, well, when an airplane and a giant robot love each other *very* much...""

""It's working!"" Irwin suddenly exclaimed. ""Stop kicking! The airplane is in an aerodynamic stall. Its engines aren't enough to keep it in the air. Just a little bit of thrust from our legs, and we should be able to bring this unholy union to the ground!""

The mecha and airplane, locked in their hostile embrace, continued to plummet downwards.

""Why do you think the airliner hasn't cut its engines?"" Dwight asked. ""That would make our job a lot more difficult.""

""Maybe they didn't think of it,"" Gary suggested. ""We jolted them pretty hard when we hit; maybe they're unconscious.""

""Or maybe they're just panicking,"" Stacy wryly observed.

""Let's just hope our luck doesn't run out!"" Gary added. ""I think I can guide us to that empty field near the interstate. I'll try to slow down before we hit, but I can't guarantee anything. We're getting dangerously low on fuel. Brace for impact!""

On the ground, traffic on the interstate had come to a halt. People had left their cars to gawk at the garishly-colored spectacle plummeting towards them. As the airliner's jet engines continued to strain against its captor, the mecha fired its rockets in a finely-coordinated pattern, trying to steer them to the grassy plain, one of the few areas nearby that wasn't either trees or buildings. A few moments before reaching the ground, the mecha's leg-rockets suddenly flared brightly, slowing their descent and starting a few small brush fires. With a surprisingly gentle crushing noise, the airliner landed on the ground, the mecha still firmly attached to its top.

They continued to slide along the ground. ""Their engines are still firing! If we don't stop them, they'll drag us both into the river!""

""How about if I pinch their engines?"" Irwin offered. ""I'll have to let go with the arms, but I should be able to do this.""

""I think that's our best bet,"" Gary agreed. ""Do it!""

The mecha's arms let go. Quickly, it slid down the length of the airliner, but suddenly, the legs grappled the aircraft's sides, stopping its motion. Now in position, the arms reached towards the engines and crushed them with its hands. Jet fuel sprayed from the wounded turbines as the airliner and its giant passenger slid along the ground for several hundred more feet, finally coming to a stop.

The external microphones picked up a buzzing sound, growing louder. ""Where did the drones come from?"" Stacy asked. ""The highway?""

""That's it!"" Gary suddenly interjected. ""Irwin, rip the roof off of the flight deck! Let the drones take care of the hijackers!""

""You got it!"" The mecha shimmied up the length of the airliner; when it got near the front, its giant hands dug its fingers under the sides, peeling the roof back like a giant sardine can. Four hijackers stood in the exposed flight deck, gaping upwards in sheer terror. Quickly, the drones swarmed them; a few precisely-fired taser bolts later, and they all collapsed to the ground.

""YOU DID IT!"" a voice on the radio yelled. More cheering could be heard in the background. Stacy reacted with surprise. ""Wait, was that Eric Thompson?""

""It's me, and everyone else at headquarters!"" Eric answered. ""Plus several million more viewers on TV.""

""Wow,"" Stacy stammered. ""Way to bury the lede there, boss.""

""Are you kidding?"" Eric gushed. ""We wouldn't have missed this for the world!""

""Uh..."" Irwin began. ""Glad to be of service?""

The external microphones now picked up the cheers of the passengers. The emergency doors had opened, the exit chutes had inflated, and passengers were sliding out of the stricken aircraft as quickly as they could. Most of them gawked at the giant robot, which continued to sit astride the airplane, like a brightly-colored cowboy on a white horse. A few had run off, to stamp out the small brush fires caused by the mecha's rockets.

The external cameras showed the highway, the passengers having left their cars en masse. All were cheering and clapping.

""Did we actually live through that?"" Irwin's voice gasped weakly. ""The adrenaline is wearing off. I think I'm going to lose it.""

""Permission to lose it granted,"" Sam jokingly intoned. ""You've all done a great job.""

""You know what would be awesome?"" Dwight piped up. ""We should fly away from here, back to base, and salute in the air for everyone on the highway.""

""Not going to happen,"" Isabel related over the radio. ""You only have thirty pounds of fuel left.""

""Can we siphon anything from the airliner?"" Stacy asked.

Isabel paused for a moment. ""You don't have anything to siphon with,"" she sighed. ""We never thought to add such an attachment.""

""Then what do we do?"" Dwight pined. ""We can't just lay here and wait for a big flatbed to pick us up. That'd be embarrassing!""

""There's a truck stop about two miles down the highway,"" Sam offered. ""Diesel fuel is close enough to aircraft fuel for the mecha's systems. And between your remaining battery power, and the internal generators, you have enough power to..."" Sam paused for a moment. ""To walk there.""

""Well, I guess that'll still look pretty cool,"" Dwight agreed reluctantly. ""But not what I was hoping for.""

Gary's voice crackled over the mecha's loudspeakers. ""Citizens, please give me some space. I need to leave."" The passengers obediently formed a wide circle around the mecha. Slowly, it moved to stand up and dismount the airliner, to the cheers of everyone nearby. Unsteadily, the mecha walked towards the highway; the circle of people parted to let them through.

""Blast off! Blast off!"" the kids yelled, picked up by the external microphones. ""See, I knew they'd want that,"" Dwight sighed. ""We need to plan better in the future.""

Gary's voice once again blared from the loudspeaker. ""Sorry, kids. Not enough fuel. But maybe next time!"" All four pilots could hear their disappointed whines. Gary continued. ""Hey, c'mon, kids! I'm still a giant flying robot!"" The kids quickly began cheering again. The mecha slowly, clumsily walked away.

""OK, I think our autopilot can handle this,"" Gary declared. ""Just watch for sinkholes or loose soil.""

As they neared the highway, the disembarked passengers continued to cheer and clap. The mecha stopped and stood there. The loudspeaker crackled once again with Gary's voice. ""Citizens, please move your vehicles. I have to get home."" They finally stopped cheering, went back into their cars, and got out of the way. The mecha crawled up the embankment, walked across the lanes of traffic, and began trudging down the highway in the slow lane. Cars slowly drove past it, horns honking and passengers whooping, before driving off. The mecha occasionally saluted, to even louder cheers.

The customers at the truck stop could hear the rhythmic clanking noise from quite some distance away. As the mecha approached, most of them just stood and stared, their mouths gaping. The mecha walked into the parking lot, picked a row of interior pumps, and stood there, waiting. The loudspeaker flared again. ""Don't mind me, citizens. I just need fuel. I'll wait in line.""

The two truckers that were next in line made several animated arm gestures, then each got into their trucks, started them up, and moved to back up. The mecha backed up too, getting out of their way. Deftly, the trucks slithered past each side of the mecha, smoothly arriving back in their lanes. ""Thank you, citizens!"" the loudspeaker blared.

Slowly, the mecha lowered itself onto its hands and knees. From there, it shifted to a prone position, and began to army-crawl between the rows of gas pumps. The clanking and scraping made a ferocious noise that caused many onlookers to cover their ears. Finally, the mecha was in position, and the steady hum of its power shut down, leaving behind a ghostly silence.

A few moments passed. Then the sides of each limb opened up, and the pilots exited, lowering themselves gingerly to the ground. As the onlookers continued to gawk, the pilots nonchalantly pulled out their company credit cards, swiped them at the pumps, then each removed a gas cap and put the diesel spouts into the exposed fuel filler.

The trucker opposite Dwight stammered. ""Uh...er...um...what kind of mileage do you get in that thing?""

""I'm not sure,"" Dwight answered. ""We just burned about five hundred pounds; that got us a total of about fifteen miles. We used a lot less fuel during free-fall, though.""

""Free-fall?"" the trucker replied weakly. ""Buddy, you must have horseshoes in *both* pockets.""

A few families had crowded around Irwin. ""How do you become a giant-robot pilot?"" one kid asked.

""First, you have to invent it,"" Irwin answered. ""I'm part of the team that built this. We have two more back at our lab.""

""Do they fly too?"" The kid's eyes burned with adoration.

""Not yet, but after today, I'm sure we'll add it soon!"" The kid looked disappointed. Irwin continued. ""But...you know what they *can* do? Kung fu battle! Just like in the movies!"" The kid gaped wordlessly.

""What company do you work for?"" a man asked. ""Who is in the giant-robot business?""

""I'm with a research-and-development division of Unlimited Partners,"" Irwin answered. ""And we do a lot more than just giant robots.""

""Well, I'm sure glad you do!"" the man exulted. ""That was fine work, stopping that hijacking. Can you believe the government hasn't even released a statement on it? I think they're too humiliated.""

""I haven't had time to catch up on the news,"" Irwin explained. ""I'm sure I will...once I fly back to the office.""

""That's right, ladies — you *too* can become a giant-robot pilot!"" Stacy happily explained to a throng of Girl Scouts, hanging on her every word. ""And I don't just fly it; I helped *design* and *build* it! But you'll need to stay in school, study hard, and keep out of trouble! Jobs like these only go to the best! And *you* can make it this far, if you just apply yourselves!""

""We will!"" they cheered as they ran off to get back in their vans.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that,"" the den mother told Stacy.

""No problem, I get it,"" Stacy answered. ""I know the Girl Scouts are for at-risk children. Hopefully they stay inspired.""

The den mother glanced at the mecha, her eyes filled with wonder. ""If *that* doesn't inspire them...*nothing* will.""

A thin, gangly man in business-casual left the shop and approached Gary, a stunned look on his face. Gary turned and smiled. ""Are you the manager?"" He tried to answer, but couldn't find his voice; finally, he just nodded vigorously.

""What's the pre-authorization limit on these pumps?"" Gary asked nonchalantly.

""Uh...ummm...seventy five gallons,"" the manager stammered.

""Can we all get authorized for about a thousand gallons each? We have a long flight home.""

""I...um...yes. I'll...go do...that."" The manager walked off, looking behind him one last time before disappearing inside the shop.

As the mecha continued to fuel, Dwight walked up to Stacy. ""So...before the next time...*rubber shoes*.""

Stacy laughed. ""I know, right? I though the *flight* was bad...the walk was easily *twice* as bad! I think my bones are still shaking.""

""And rubber knee pads and elbow pads, too.""

""Yeah...I'm not looking forward to fixing all those scrapes. But can you imagine it? The mecha will look like a roller-derby player! How awesome would *that* be?"" Stacy looked at the mecha, grinning impishly. ""How about retractable inline skates? The *heck* with all this walking!""

""Oh yeah, huh?"" Dwight agreed. ""I guess there are some ideas that don't occur to you unless you try the thing in the real world."" Dwight looked at the mecha's back. ""And why the heck don't we have a giant flaming sword?""

The four pilots continued to field questions, and receive congratulations, as the pumps slowly filled up the mecha. Finally, they put the spouts back, replaced the gas caps, and climbed back inside their respective flight decks, giving the crowds one last thumb's up before disappearing inside, to the din of their hails and cheers.

The mecha powered up, its electric hum making the air shake. This brought on another round of applause and whooping. It slowly army-crawled from under the canopy, back to unobstructed space. The metallic screeching and scraping sound silenced the crowd quickly as they covered their ears and winced.

""*Oh* my God,"" Irwin began. ""I haven't dealt with so much of the public in my *life*!""

""I heard *that*!"" Stacy added. ""This was fun once, but if there are any more public appearances, I think we need to use gregarious pilot types. I thought the *battle* was tough...having to deal with people was *much* more draining!""

""Hey Gary, once we're out, can we launch with only three of the rockets?"" Dwight asked. ""I really want to try a salute as we leave.""

""I think that'll be safe,"" Gary answered. ""But don't try anything fancy. Just one salute and we're done.""

""Not a problem,"" Dwight laughed. ""I'm willing to start small.""

The mecha walked to the far end of the complex's parking lot, away from the people, trucks, and anything flammable. After turning to face the crowd, its leg rockets ignited, along with one arm. As the mecha launched into the sky, its free arm moved to salute, before dropping that arm down and firing the last rocket. The exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but the rockets made too much noise to hear them.

The flight back to their airport was uneventful and leisurely. There was no need to use full rocket power; all the pilots had had enough of high G forces for one day.

The mecha neared the airport. The exterior cameras showed that huge crowds had formed on either side of the runway. The radio suddenly crackled to life. ""Welcome back, robo-nauts!"" Eric Thompson's voice gushed. ""You're all heroes!""

""Oh, man,"" Gary answered. ""I hope you don't expect us to deal with any more people. All we want to do is collapse."" The mecha moved to land upright.

""Not a problem,"" Eric assured them. ""You just need to land and crawl back inside. We'll deal with the press.""

""Thanks, boss,"" Gary replied, with great relief in his voice. ""The truck stop was agonizing, but we didn't know what else to do."" The mecha landed gently on the ground; the exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but they couldn't be heard over the roar of the rockets.

""I understand completely,"" Eric commiserated. ""And rest assured, you all get the rest of the day off. Well, after a full medical exam. We want to make sure you're intact.""

The mecha got down on its hands and knees. ""So do we,"" Gary agreed. ""We're just glad to have survived.""

""So am I,"" Eric answered sanguinely. ""And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about the reaction. Lots of nonpublic stuff. You all did more good today than you can possibly imagine.""

The mecha crawled through the hangar door. ""That's fine...but *tomorrow*. We need a break.""

""You've earned it,"" Eric agreed. ""Have a good evening.""

The hangar door closed behind the mecha, the loud clang reverberating across the runway."
"Top signs we're living in a cyberpunk futureTo go along with everyone else's ""Wait, did the world become cyberpunk and I didn't notice?"" I should point out the following facts:

1. From Robocop. ""OCP traditionally dabbled in not for profit industries like healthcare, prisons, and space travel."" All of which are now common works.

2. Hacktivist anarchist groups out to bring down government and corporate conspiracies actually exist.

3. Underground journalists and leakers are actually the biggest threat to First World security in the opinion of the Powers that be.

4. The FBI hired hackers to open a terrorist's phone.

5. The entirety of Enron was black comedy Frank Miller couldn't have written. For example: They fixed the California elections to put a action movie star in as governor while simultaneously shutting down half the state's power plants to create an artificial energy shortage. This while they were bankrupt from hiding all of their losses for a decade. That's some Shadowrun stuff right there.

6. The governments bailed out all the megacorps for gross financial stupidity.

7. The world's largest mercenary company, G4, does a large number of the West's prison system as well as corporate security.

8. Bionic limbs created by 3D printers are real. The latter because people can't afford the metal ones.

9. News networks (take your pick) exist as for profit entities catering to the whim of their audience's bias.

10. A reality TV show star and billionaire is the President after a guy who favored unlimited surveillance and use of assassination robots.

17. The world's eighth largest pyramid is a Bass Pro Shop in Tennessee.

18. The working class pay 95% of all taxes versus 5% by corporations when it was reversed in the Forties.

19. It's possible to buy a carbon fiber katana over the internet. Ditto mirror shades and a bullet proof trench coat--all shipped to you overnight.

20. The police now have Special Forces units in every city and many places have them driving APCs as well as tanks.

21. Social media resulted in spontaneous revolutions in several Arab countries. The crackdowns were pretty damn awful to say the least.

22. Virtual Reality is a thing with actual games being shipped for it.

23. Mass data mining occurs just to find out what you would buy from a online store and why.

24. Amazon has sold dumb AI for your house and Microsoft has done the same for your computer.

25. China is now the predominate economic power in the world due to how much leverage it has over the United States.

26. The Soviet Union may have fallen but we're back to Russians making sinister plans to take over the world, only now with computer hackers.

27. Electric self-driving cars exist but no one uses them versus oil guzzling military-looking ones.

28. The world's largest environmental disaster was paid for in fines which left the oil company fine.

29. It's impossible to tax most trans-national corporations due to their multinational nature.

30. Criminal syndicates with ties to terrorism have forced governments to treat with them.

31. Global warming has reached the point of ""so obvious it's flooding cities"" while corporations still foster people denying it.

32. Countries have places where there's not enough to eat or a central government but citizens possess Ipods.

33. A wetworks black ops against Iran's nuclear program was conducted entirely by hackers.

34. People have died playing video games because they didn't stop long enough to pee.

35. North Korea may have attacked America's movie industry with computer sabotage.

36. The fact mercenary-for-hire criminal hackers is an actual profession. They even have names based on what kind of hat they wear.

37. The fact artificial worlds people live much of their lives in are common pastimes online now.

38. The fact some postage is now being delivered by flying robots.

39. The fact individuals are still trying to make artificial islands to be lawless tax-free corporate states. Double points that these invariably become scams to bilk investors.

40. All of this is actually right on time for 2020."
"What do we think about Neuralink?Elon Musk tweeted about an exciting new development for his Neuralink  technology, stating that it was “awesome.” And that it might just beat  out competitors like Utah Array. 

For those that don’t know, Neuralink is a company that Musk founded back in 2017 which focuses on developing technologies that allow computers to interface with the human brain. They aren’t the only one, but I could be mistaken in thinking that they're the closest to making it a reality--but it definitely feels that way right now. 

Musk has gotten a lot of attention in the media lately for his seemingly public meltdown(s) (or midlife crisis?) But has stated that Neuralink is extremely close to bridging that gap. Whether he's being overly  optimistic or not only time will tell.

But  I found the tech descriptions really interesting and used them for the  basis of the VR implants you'll find in the Neo Rackham series. 

The  tech works by implanting tiny fiberoptic wires into the subject’s brain. The wires are implanted into the patient’s brain via a tiny robot that zips around their cranium. Such technology could be used to control your phone from a distance, dim the lights and turn on your smart home’s security system, and maybe even drive a car with only the use of your brain.

Now,  inevitably, anytime the idea of merging human organs and  technology arises, people often come out of the woodwork to scream about  the  horrors that might result from such a fusion (but, really, we're already fucking cyborgs as it is, given how reliant we are on our phones and computers).

And while those fears are definitely founded right now, especially with how corporations are behaving in the midst of this pandemic, one can hope that something positive can come out of this tech. Though, personally, I don't know if I'd be jumping to give a corporation unchecked access to my thoughts, you know?"
"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"Worldbuilding concept: Getting paid by sponsors for conversational ads.I apologize if this is well-trod territory, but I wanted to hopefully inspire some of you world-builders out there to really sell the sellout mentality of many cyberpunk societies.

Imagine if you will, that the everyday person could sign up for a sponsorship program where you give a company permission to access the live feed from your bionics. Why do this? Because every time you mention that company's products, you get credits!

""Hey, I love the color of that car. So white. Almost as white as my sheets when I use <name brand> fabric detergent!"" *Ping! Ka-ching!* 

The company even pays you bonuses if your bionics can detect positive reactions. A one on one conversation is a pittance, but if you manage to drop an ad spot in the middle of a speech when you have the rapt attention of an audience of 50? Big money! 

Now let's take this a step further into crazytown. Of course there's the rubes that'll make beer money with the odd ad spot, and most people don't even care they're being advertised to constantly by their get-rich-quick obsessed aunt, but the real cyberpunk happens when the seedier parts of society get their hands on sponsorships. 

You'll have junkies huddled together in a dark room practicing their ""ad-react"" faces so they can ping-pong ads. One of them gives a half-assed reaction and a fight breaks out. 

Camera cuts to a guy in a room with a half-dozen epitomes of the phrase ""uncanny valley"" and the blue-white glow of an array of monitors. He drops an ad spot, hits a button on a console, and the mannequins light up in a macabre facsimile of amusement to the sound of a half-hearted *Ping!*. A few click-clacks on the keyboard and he tries the exact same ad spot again with a slightly less disappointing *Ping!* after his robotic audience quiets. His eyes widen, another few click-clacks, one more run at the ad. This time, several enthusiastic *Ping! Ka-chings!* follow and the camera cuts away once more from a shot of his maliciously mischievous grin.

This time we're in what looks like an abandoned office space or run down community hall with a single white sheet of paper that reads ""Improv Night"". Sitting in a circle in dilapidated chairs are people all taking turns AA-style to give an ad spot while others mime positive reactions. Suddenly, the doors are kicked in, windows smashed, and panicked actors arrested by the jackbooted fraud unit. After all, what greater crime is there in our cyberpunk dystopia than defrauding the gracious corporations who share with us their wealth in exchange for a few simple words?

Edit: Another few fun scenes that just crossed my mind: You get paid more based on how wealthy the people are you ad-spot to. A man sits down at a restaurant alone and begins working on a tablet computer. His waiter drops a half-hearted ad spot and stops mid-stride as he walks away from the table. As it turns out, this man is freaking loaded, and ad-spots to him have a quadruple multiplier. A few hushed whispers between the kitchen staff, and a swell of people build around his table all attempting to drop ads. Eventually his private security steps in to create a barrier so he can continue his business.

Edit 2: A young couple agrees to meet for a date. Before that happens, they exchange messages to indicate that there is to be no ad-dropping over the course of their date. Towards the end of the evening as they share a cold treat at the end of a wonderful time at the carnival, one of them accidentally slips an ad-spot and notices that the person they're seeing has a really low multiplier. Suddenly a chemistry-filled night turns sour as they realize that the person they've been dating has extremely low net worth and the perspective character's shallowness is revealed."

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"Are MegaCorps just huge legalized punk gangs in the future? Is the ultimate evolution of any organized crime is to become a MegaCorp? Or is the ultimate evolution of the Cyberpunk the Megacorp?This thought sort of came after watching Ready:Player One and the new 2077 trailer. While Player One is quite dystopian its still surprising to see the MegaCorp in that movie have full legal rights, to be armed and roaming on American streets, run their own jurisdiction, run drone sweeps, imprison people for ""violating the TOS"" or whatever and so on. Mind you also be the cause of bombings without any pushback from anyone. Basically they are ""the police"" until the actual police show up near the end but basically are operating a racket. 

The 2077 trailer hinted quite at the idea that cyberpunks are adopted by megacorps and/or hired into the corporate structure, rather than the Megacorps sort of hiring their own or from another caste. It sort of runs the line of black hat vs white hat in the typical ""hackers archetype story"" for example, Mr.Robot.

And knowing that in nearly every case of a fictional megacorp getting into security they are generally on the main causes of ""dystopia"" or the thing the hero needs to take down. The thing is...they are born out of the cyberpunks and the times themselves. They are always the ultimate evolution of the corporation/gang/group trying to integrate themselves in a technologically advance world. And while usually its not all hacker culture true cyberpunk types, cyborg or android soldiers/police that aren't in the government find themselves on the streets or in megacorp. 

Since the origin, or at least employment of any MegaCorp is pretty much cyberpunks on the street at some point, MegaCorps will just never disappear if you take one down. 

In the real world, its more a of duality between employment with a corporation and how you live your private life. But corporations aren't horrendously offensive as to arm themselves against the local populace (that is the very definition of a MegaCorp almost, when they start arming themselves) and while rosy pictures are painted in PR department origins, its always clear dark pasts are rewrote and dark presents are being hidden from sight.  

Just some interesting thoughts on the subject."
"A List of Cyber Punk Short Films on VimeoI love watching short films and recently realized that I should try searching the term cyberpunk on Vimeo; I wish I did it sooner. These are the best I have discovered so far (descriptions are taken from the Vimeo page):

--------

[EXIT PLAN](https://vimeo.com/140639178): A short, character driven, sci-fi film about an exile called Adam. After machines became the sole workforce for the industry, The lower classes were deemed surplus to requirements and banished from the utopian cities and left to starve. The story focuses on Adam, a man trapped in the slums of this dark future. As the rebels plot against the elite known as The Order, Adam is left stuck in the middle accompanied by his only companion, a robotic helper called iO. After discovering that the Earth will soon be destroyed by a cosmic natural disaster, Adam has to find a way off the planet.

[DISARM](https://vimeo.com/73118692): In the near future, robotic limbs have become more powerful and versatile than the human body, granting their users incredible new powers. A new law is passed regulating the use of the dangerous technology, causing a leading prosthetics distributor to recall its products. An employee and a police officer go door-to-door collecting the bionic limbs, but not everyone will hand over their arms willingly.

[True Skin](https://vimeo.com/51138699): About a thief in a dystopian future where cybernetics are the norm.

The UNCORP claimed that the creation of the cyber-clones would be the bridge to a free and equal society, without thinking that their human nature would fight against the role they were created for: to be slaves.

[SYNC](https://vimeo.com/110149838): Every 15 seconds, a computer, network, or mobile device is hacked by cyber-terrorists. To combat this problem, Syntek Industries has manufactured data couriers designed from advanced machine robotics. These couriers are known as SYNCS. Syncs are programmed to securely deliver data packages without interruption.

[Com Truise - Brokendate](https://vimeo.com/29268321): Music as evocative as the stuff made by Com Truise—master of the transporting synth odyssey—necessitates videos that are nothing short of cinematic. Hence the fully blown-out treatment for “Brokendate,” which rolls everything from eighties cop noir to Blade Runner retro-futurism to slo-mo Hype Williams nods into one five-minute world unto itself.

[PLURALITY](https://vimeo.com/50976572): In 2023, the Bentham Grid goes online...

"[Story] The girl who slept on the catwalks above the flea marketThe sun was setting around Beijing. Wearing an open-chest white suit of the finest fabric money could buy, a golden necklace around his neck, Shao Leng waited for his bodyguards to clear the halls of the apartment building.

""Mom..."", said the young girl, ""the bastards are here...""  
""Don't call them that, I've told you a thousand times.""  
""But you know...""  
""I know!"", her mother replied, almost angry. A sigh.  
""Look"", she added, kneeling down to hug her. Mommy's going to deal with the... those men. No matter what you hear, promise me you won't come out of your room until they're gone, okay?  
""Mom, is something bad going to happen?""  
""Nothing bad"", she lied. She smiled, but her eyes frowned. ""Remember, hide in your closet and don't come out, okay?""  
""Can I go to the catwalks instead? I have my air mask right here.""  

Her mother realized that the farther from home, the safer she'd be right now.
""Alright, honey, you can go to the catwalks, and don't come back until 9.""  
""Why, mom?""  
""Because you don't want to intrude into your mom's privacy. Mom's privacy is very important, okay?""  
""Okay, mom...""  
The door banged.  

""WE'RE HERE FOR THE RENT, WOMAN!!""  

""Go... go!!""  

The mother saw her child walk out the window before climbing the emergency stairs to the catwalks. She closed the window and the shades.  
Swallowing and taking a deep breath, she said a brief prayer before running to the door. She unlocked the door. The gang leader looked angry.  

""What took you so long?""  
""I was... in the bathroom...""  
""Have you got this month's payment?""  
""I only got 400...""  
""Woman, I warned you before...""  
""Peharps... I could persuade you somehow to give me more time?""  

The woman unbuttoned her shirt slowly and bit her lip, partially seducing him and partially out of anxiety.  
A mischievous smile crossed the leader's face. ""Well, if you put it that way... wait, don't you have a kid?""  
""She's out... she won't come back until much later.""  
""Hey, you're a bad mother, you know you should be taking care of your child...""  
The bodyguards laughed.  
""She's with some friends...""  
""So there's nobody at home?""  
The woman closed her eyes and shook her head. She turned around and let her shirt fall to the floor. ""Please... make yourself at home.""  
The entire gang entered the bedroom and closed the door.  

--  

Lucy didn't know what those men were going to do to her mother. She suspected, but didn't want to think about it. It was something women were supposed to do, anyway. But it didn't feel right... not since dad passed away a few years ago.   

Away with all that. The sun was setting. And somehow, the polluted air of Beijing let the sunset look especially beautiful. And then began the lights show.  
Little by little, the LED fixtures began lighting in the markets below. Lucy loved watching the lights. They were mesmerizing.

What was most intriguing was the curious people that came to the market. Beijing had changed a lot in the last 2 years. Visitors from all around the world came here. Not just white men wearing all kinds of metal limbs and colored glasses that covered their entire faces, but there were crittermen, too. ""Transhumans"", they called themselves. There was a guy with dragon skin, people with bug eyes, some even had wings and tails.  

Lucy got a bit curious about some of those easterners' bodyguards. Giant monsters with fearsome claws, calling the attention of everybody. Those were the Youkai. Expensive bodyguards, from Japan. She didn't know if they were people or just robots. But some got angry. They were half-animal, perhaps?  
Looking at the lights and the people gathering around the market made her feel sleepy. But she also felt dizzy. ""Oh, my mask!""  

She put on her mask, covered herself with her cape, and fell asleep on the catwalk. She was waken up by a beeping sound.  
""Aw, crap... it's running out of clean air. I better go home.""  

She began climbing the scaffolding to the next catwalk, when she saw a man that reminded her of the bastards. He was smiling and showing off his money to some woman that was almost naked. He began touching her in all places.  
She imagined the woman with mom's face, sad, and frightened. An idea came to her. She grabbed a nearby bottle of beer and threw it at the man. When she saw him bleed, she felt good.  

""HEY!!! WHO THE FUCK DID THAT!!!""  

From the thin air, she saw a light. The light was shaped like a human, and when the light vanished, she saw that he was wearing one of those weird glasses. 

""Above! On the cat walk!""  

*Shit. They saw me!!!*  

""Get that kid!!!""  

*Shit shit shit shit shit*  

She began to run. She hesitated when arriving to the scaffolding.   
*No, I don't want them to know where I live!*  

She turned to the right instead. Unfortunately, there was no more catwalk in there... just a long fall down. Wait, there were some cardboard boxes ahead... maybe if she jumped real fast...  

She fell short by a meter.

IIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!  

""Katcha!!!""  

That sounded like english. And the voice wasn't like the man with glasses. She felt... fur?  
A woman had just saved her. She felt herself falling and caught again.  

""Hoo aar yuu?""  
She didn't understand English. She had tried to learn it, but it was just strange syllables to her.  
""Ahr yuu olrait?""  
More weird twisted syllables.  
""Ou.. sorri.""  

""Sorry."" That word she did understand. Then the woman spoke to her again, this time in proper Mandarin.  

""Sorry, forgot to turn on my translator. Are you okay?""  
Lucy nodded.  
""Who are you, why did you attack that man? Did he do something bad to you?""  
When she paid attention to the woman, she realized she was one of those critterpeople. The back of her arms were covered in fur, and she had ears like a cat. Her face was totally human, tho, and it looked beautiful.  
Before she could answer, the man arrived to the alley, pressing a red stained handkerchief against his forehead.  
""Hey! YOU! Give us that kid!""  

""I'm sorry, she's new around here. She was playing target and somehow she missed... I'm sorry, how much should I pay you for the injury?""  
""No. No payment. The kid has to be punished.""  
""Fine. I'll punish her.""  
The woman knelt down to her. ""Pretent I hit you very bad, and cry."" Then the woman smacked her, and Lucy threw herself to the floor, screaming.  
""DON'T. DO THAT. AGAIN!!! Is that fine sir? I'm really, really sorry.""  
""No. She needs to bleed. Or YOU can bleed instead.""  

The woman turned around, and clenched her fists.

""NO. I offered you payment, and you refused. Now don't threaten me... or YOU could be the one who bleeds. And not just the forehead.""  
Lucy saw a faint glitter behind the woman. It was the invisible man.  

""BEHIND YOU!!!""  

But it was too late. Lucy heard an impact.  

""Hrrrkkk!""  

The woman-cat frowned at the man.  ""Tsk tsk tsk... that's playing dirty, you know..""  
""Kkhhhhhhrrkkk....""  
With a squeeze of her hand, something in the invisible man cracked. His body fell to the floor, while the head rolled down to the man's feet, tubing and wires protruding out of the neck.

The rich man stepped back. ""That was a series X29. Not even a transhuman could do that.""

The realization made the man's blood freeze.

""Wait a minute... youkai!!!!???""  

The woman-cat grinned, and leaped at the man's chest, knocking him down. She extended her claws at him.... she had claws!?!?  
""Look, mister. I don't know who you are and I don't care. But you don't mess with this girl. Is that clear?""  
The man nodded.  
""Now SCRAM before I shred you into sushi and serve your pieces to the Shogun!""  
The man ran away.  
The woman-cat approached Lucy, looking angry. Just like mom at times. ""So, why did you hit him? Did he do something to you? You shouldn't do that, you know? You could have gotten yourself killed!""  
""I... I'm sorry...""  
""Why? Why did you do that?""  
""Because... he reminded me of one of those bastards.""  
""What bastards?""  
""The ones who killed our landlord... they're the landlords now. And they ask twice the pay... and... and they're with my mom now... doing *things* to her... and I don't know... I...""  

The girl burst in tears.  

""Do you know who that man is?""  
The girl sniffed... and nodded.  
""Shao Leng. His name is Shao Leng.""  
The woman-cat gasped. She paused for a couple of seconds, then nodded at someone. But nobody was around.

""Who are you nodding to? Is there another invisible person around?""  
""Oh no, we're talking over the net.""  
""The net? Oh... you got implants?""  
""Of course I do, silly. Everyone in Hong Kong has them.""  
""Hong Kong? But... you... the guy said you were a Youkai. Aren't Youkai from Japan?""  
""It's a long story. Look, I'm going to take you somewhere safe, and then you'll tell me where this Shao Leng is. Deal?""  
""Are you going to kill him?""  
""What?""  
""Please. Please kill him.""  
""Hey, you shouldn't wish for those things... but I understand. Don't worry, we'll know how to deal with him. And he'll regret touching your mom.""  
""Thank, you, miss cat.""  
""You're welcome. Now hold tight, we're gonna jump up!""  

The woman-cat jumped to the scaffolding as if it was no deal. The jumps gave her the chills, but looking at the city from above was beautiful.  
After a few jumps, they arrived to a roof. There were other creature-people like Miss Cat.  

""Sorry guys! I have an unexpected guest. By the way, what's your name, girl?""  
""Lucy.""  
""Lucy... that's a foreign name.""  
""Yeah, my dad was from Esperanza... he chose my name.""  
""Nice to meet you, Lucy. I'm Jenny, and these are my friends.""  

Friends.

It was good to have friends."
"A little brain augmentation: Mosaic 17K, and how to help the EFF.Hello readers of /r/Cyberpunk!
  
I am here to offer you the latest in brain augmentation, with a side of charitable contribution! First, [direct your eyes to the pretty butterfly made via deep learning program!](https://imgur.com/jogFG0j) 

^^^Brain ^^^augmentation ^^^is ^^^a ^^^euphemism ^^^for ^^^reading ^^^a ^^^book.
  
Now, while the subliminal messages seep in. My purpose is the support of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, without whom we would not be free to jailbreak our devices, we'd already be outlawed from fixing our own hardware, and be even more jammed up by shady ISPs. So please, spare a moment.
  
I am an author who recently published my debut cyberpunk thriller entitled *Mosaic 17K*. It's near future, the main character is literally born in 2017, and it features tech such as: computer security, mesh networking, hardware hacking, near-future hardware (memristors, q-processors, etc), materials science, new battery technologies, and a lot more. It also deals in robots, artificial intelligence, the results of automation on society, faceless corporations, failing governments, lots of virtual/augmented reality, and people being murdered. Someone gets their head blown up. Seriously. *Chunky salsa.* It's low life, it's high tech, it's cynically humorous, and *it rains a lot* (I'm joking, but not really).
  
It's a cultural examination, a hacker story with proper exploit concepts, a philosophical treatment on consciousness, a little bit military sci-fi, and a warning of climate issues to come! It's the product of three academic degrees, ten years in the tech industry, and a year of miserable self-editing. The last being more grueling than the other fifteen years combined. It covers a lot. It's a *big* book, full of heart and well-meaning degenerates.
  
If you buy a copy during April 2017, I'll donate half of my royalties to the EFF on your behalf. It'll all go into one big lump sum when they disperse and I'll send it along to the EFF directly.
  
**Why I want to support the EFF:**
  
The EFF has been active since 1990, at least three years longer than the majority of Internet users have been online. For the old'ins like me, remember that Eternal September started in 1993! During that time the EFF did the self-start from crummy offices nobody knew about, dealt with tinfoil hat types, and ramped up to a force that can challenge the US Government at the Supreme Court as needed. They slay dirty policies, patent trolls, and shady congressional bills like dragons. They are the public defenders *that we need but do not deserve*. But the EFF are also a non-profit and as much as I dislike asking people for money, they run on money.

So what I offer is all that I have of value: words that took a year and a half of my life to get right. It's all I've got. I'm throwing 266,286 words, or 613 print pages down on the EFF's behalf. That's my end of the deal. This isn't one of those half-worked novellas people charge ten bucks for online. It's thirty chapters of mystery, adventure, and action.

*[Mosaic 17K](http://mosaic17k.com)* is now available on Amazon as an ebook and in paperback. All sales of Mosaic 17K will be split 50/50 with the EFF during the month of April 2017."

"[+] June 2079, Personal Log Entries* June 9 2079

* Entry #45

* 20:07

What a fucking drag of a day.

Five robot-related deaths in the past two weeks. People these days, trusting their robotic ""companions"" (nice word for a fucking slave) to cook their food, watch their kids and style their hair. This death was important though. The new owner of BluCore got shanked by his little butler. 

The kid just inherited the biggest corporation in the country, of course they sent us to clean up the mess. Can't be too mad though, if not for the kid's father, I'd be long gone. Too bad the old man couldn't save himself with all that tech he invested in. I'm not surprised, bastard was old when I was young. I kinda liked the guy.

The kid decided he's gonna live in a private island, good, makes it easy to hide this incident from the public eye. ""The owner of the biggest manufacturer of robotics and augmentation got killed by his own product"", one headline like that and it's the bottom of the stock market for BluCore. Too bad he also decided to have the best security money can buy. Took 3 hours for Brad to work his magic and god forbid we blow a few holes and make a forced entry. See, sensitive data could get damaged. Watch HQ take this bastard's death and find a way to make a profit. Couldn't give less of a shit.

We move in. Top floors are clear, we make our way down the elevator shaft. Pop the doors open and here's the scenery of the century. Kid's lying in a blood pool, robot's standing there with a butter knife, looking at him with a dead expression, repeating standard lines ""how was your day, sir?"", ""how are you doing, sir?"", ""how was work today, sir?"" Some fucking nightmare fuel right there.

We disable the robot. Would have been fun to rip its head off, but our murderous friend was part of the ""sensitive data"". When we secured the place, clean-up crew and engineers moved in ant took over. Apparently the kid wasn't dumb, it's all need-to-know bases for us, but the engineers seemed surprised by whatever was in that lab.

 Gonna pay a visit to R&D crew tomorrow, the new augs been jamming up.

"Cyberpunk Premises?What are some cyberpunk premises for literature, games, films, etc. you've thought up? Here's one I made up when I was like 13 or something after playing Dead Space and I've been fucking around with the idea since, not that I have the skill to actually produce any interesting media about.

> So get this, the Burj Khalifa, times twenty, on Phobos, the larger moon of Mars. It's the early 23rd century, and 75-85% of the Earth's population migrated to Mars on colony ships because of global warming/nukes/climate change or something. Factions based mostly on language are formed between the human colonies, with massive cities being constructed from sections of the colony ships and automatic construction. Terraformers are increasing the oxygen content of the planet, and water is extracted from the poles. Anyways none of that matters because I can't even start to think about the fucked up geopolitics on a planet with no oceans or atmosphere. 
 
 > So anyways, super space Burj Khalifa 2.0, named Al-lat, was built by the UAE/some rich Arab superstate as a high end resort/residence for the wealthy from all around the world, using particle acceleration engines that reduce trips to Martian space to a month or two versus half a decade. With millions of kilos of luxury supplies stored outside of the main structure, as well as hydroponic farms, a satellite network, and multiple nuclear reactors, Al-lat is entirely self-sufficient, capable of housing around 400,000 people. By the time of this exodus, the project has been in a funding crisis for years and the few people that remain are a couple of the construction company officials, wealthy investors fleeing political turmoil, around 60,000 workers, and several thousand security personnel. The rich/security officials live on the lower, more finished portion of Al-lat, and most of the workers live in the higher, incomplete portions, in a proto-slum called ""The Penthouse"", constantly threatened by the low structural integrity of the neglected architecture. I imagine this as a bunch of people living in scrap shantytowns ironically built on top of unfinished resort structures such as malls, hotels, amusement parks, etc.
> Although they are aware of whatever crisis caused the migration, it will be years before any of the supermassive colony ships(too large for particle accelerator engines because they explode when they're big or use too much energy or something idk how I'm gonna handwave that one) reach Mars, and the few refugees arriving in hijacked industrial ships are shot down by the planetary (moon-etary?) defenses. A separatist faction of the Slavic Union's (Basically USSR 2.0 but space fascism) Navy runs off with a good deal of their spaceships and a bunch of nukes while the main government decides to stay on what is left of Earth. They lay waste to Al-lat's defenses, and curbstomp the security before occupying the station and continuing construction to accommodate  the 100k or so people they brought with them, as well as building a nuclear defense system on Deimos, the smaller Martian moon. The larger population only further increases the strain on the systems that allow Al-lat to be self sufficient and a divide is very quickly formed between the laboring slumgoers and the Military/Security government.
 > 30 or so years later, Martian colonies have already become semi-developed and there exists a black market smuggling trade between them and the denizens of Al-lat. Sometime, somehow, a biological agent developed by an ancient Martian civilization finds it's way into Al-lat. Originally created as a performance enhancing combat stimulant for a Martian species, this agent is a rapidly reproducing bioorganism that has very different effects on humans. The organism latches into the nervous system before spreading across the veins and arteries, manifesting as a fungus like covering over the skin, then clustering and ultimately immobilizing the host (Think TLOU cordyceps)). Those exposed to it quickly become irrationally aggressive, and they will not cease attacking any other living thing, including other hosts, until their muscles are totally destroyed or their nervous system is. The catch is, if you have been exposed to any amount of genetic material from this Martian species (which is possible enough if you've been in contact with the fossilized remains of one or one of their biomechanical artifacts), then the agent works as originally intended and you basically have superpowers. As expected, shit hits the fan when this spreads into the Penthouse, and the security forces, formed from the Separatists, come in and try to slaughter everything with a pulse. 

TL;DR Dead Space on Phobos with Russians

Now show me some of your scenarios, doesn't have to be paragraphs long word vomit like mine lol, just shit you think would be cool that isn't ""big city 30 years in the future with robots and shit""."
"[Story] Green eyesI met her after the cyberwars of 675. Prometheus’ best and worst times. When it changed its name from ""Babylon Research"" to ""Prometheus Corporation"". When hyperreality made it to the market. When regulations weren’t so established, and hackers made the Grid their second home. You wouldn’t know if you were hacked by somebody, or by something. A dust mite, a gust of wind, anything could hack you while you were inside.

It was back then, when people started to ""get it"", that you wouldn’t carry personal information inside your implants, when they weren’t separated by security layers.

Being a Terran immigrant, I hadn’t yet accustomed to Midorian gravity, or its 25 hour cycle. Hell, I didn’t even know there were circadian implants. I, like everyone else, had to live on regsleep pills, just so you wouldn’t wake up at midnight when your body thought it was morning.

Like everyone else around, I was a refugee, and was granted safe passage to the ark ship. My new home in this planet would be the country of Esperanza. Hope.

When you go from a country threatened by wars, both civil and external, you accept anything that is thrown at you. So I said yes to the mandatory government implants, the police surveillance, just because I, like everybody else, just wanted to be safe. Privacy be damned.

It wasn’t that bad. Just to make sure you weren’t a terrorist, they scanned your brain regularly, and there were psychologists, both humans and machines, examining you, and reeducating you so you would be adapted to the new lifestyle.
To us, it didn’t matter that we had to live in cheap bioplastic slums. They were free, and we got a paycheck every two weeks, so we wouldn’t starve or be kicked out of our home. Basic income was one of the things that these people got right. So, why not?

After a few months on living in the boards, I finally got tired of the shit. I wanted a decent apartment. Maybe not a citadel house, just your basic 90-square-meter on the ground.

So I began writing music. I would get online and recruit musicians to make a band. Got a few Chinese virtual instruments, which never sounded like the real thing, but at least they were cheap, and their sensors could be translated to professional vgoods if you wanted to make a record.

And so, the Tune Dwellers were born.

We gave a few concerts in hobbyist VBars. The realms that you have to search online by browsing the pages and billboards on the walls, opening a VCam to see what they looked like, and jumping from bar to bar until you found one that you liked, or found interesting people to hang around with.

It happened in one of those bars. We were playing one of our most popular hits, when I saw her sitting on one of the tables on the upper floor.

Among Shinigamis, robots, aliens, videogame characters and what not, there she was, just wearing her human avatar, and a flimsy tank top covering just the basics. Yes, a tank top, like the ones girls use when they jack in from their beds. That’s what got me curious about her. If you’re inside, why the hell would you wear an informal underwear when you could be wearing a full deluxe dress? You could wear a cheap knockoff 3D-modeled with software, or you could wear a copy-protected micro-textured dress, made with virtual looms by Ralph Lauren, Hermes or Versace, or even your own anime fashioned copycat.

The other thing that called my attention was her aurora-colored pixie hair, like a rainbow, with a large streak of orange on the left. She was totally drunk, you could notice. That’s another thing that made me wat. She was laughing at herself, noticing how the beverage she was drinking was spilled on her legs. And she didn’t unsummon it, or reset. She just let the thing drip down her legs.

We were in the dressing room when I asked one of my bandmates. ""Hey, saw that girl in the tanktop up there?"" ""Dude, I wouldn’t go near her if I were you. Just look at her. She’s probably a dweller from a Chinese slum or something."" ""I don’t know"", I replied, remembering her smiling at me. ""I got curious."" ""Whatever, man, just don’t get hacked, okay?""

I switched my flashy tuxedo, still wondering what to wear, when I just set the choice cilinder to ""casual"" and rolled it to stop it at a random outfit.

I teleported to the backstage, pretending to be just another visitor, when I walked upstairs. There, in the lone corner of the top platform, she was finishing her last drop of Virtual alcohol.

""Whoo!"", she exclaimed, fanning herself, and giggling.

I just took a seat and put myself in front of her.


""You wouldn’t believe"", she told me without even introducing herself, ""how strong this stuff is.""
I couldn’t help it, I laughed. ""Yeah, right. You’re telling me you’re drinking virtual alcohol, and getting drunk on it? Is that a new implant or something?""

She giggled again. ""Yeah, you could say that.""

Her cleavage called my attention. And by calling my attention, I mean literally. Her tank top whistled at me and then winked, sprouting cartoon hands. ""Hey, fella, check this out!"" it said, pulling itself down and letting me see the full extent of her breasts.

I snorted. ""I’m sorry"", I said, ""it’s just the first time I see a cartoon flirting with me that way. Where the hell did you get that?""

""Made it myself"", she said. ""So, wanna fuck, or not?""

What could I say? I shrugged. ""Just as long as you don’t throw up on me.""

""Oh…"" she replied, faintly. ""I hadn’t thought of that… be right back.""

In a blink, she went back, a bit more sober, and with her tank top switched for a new set of clothes. Her T-shirt said, in bright words: ""Don’t mess with mom.""

""So,"" I said, pointing at her T-shirt, ""who’s mom?""

""I am.""

I blinked twice. ""You’re a mother?""

""What? Don’t tell me you thought my age was what I projected? You’re so silly!""

""So, um… how are the kids?""

""Oh"", she said, shrugging, ""they’re fine. A few broken bones here, a few deaths there, but not permanent, so it’s safe. They’re learning, and they all learn fast. It’s just so hard to keep up with them. I’m writing some scripts to keep them in check.""

By the way she spoke, I didn’t know whether she was joking, having a delusion, or telling the truth. See, I still wasn’t acquainted with the idea of people calling their AIs ""kids"". So yeah, she was talking about her AIs, but at the time I didn’t know.

""So, what’s a single and beautiful mom doing here in a rented bar?""

""I just had an awful argument with my boss. For me, he can go suck…""

I let her tell whatever profanities she wanted to blurt out. Then, she rested her arms on the table, and kept smiling and staring at me.

I looked into her deep green eyes, and began to realize that there was much more hidden in this girl than I ever thought. Her irises were a forest. And when I began to stare, I was inside the forest, walking with my naked feet on the grass, smelling the flowers, and seeing the most exotic birds, both real and virtual, flying by.

I heard a giggle behind me.

""Got you!"", she said, jumping on me.

I turned around. ""How the hell… how did you do this?""

""Aw… a little bit of hacking, don’t worry, it’s safe. You can disconnect anytime you want.""

I kept turning around, with the girl still hanging on my shoulders. ""Where is this?""

""Home. I live here.""

""You mean you made this?""

""Yup! All of it.""

""Wow…""

She let herself fall, grabbed a bit of grass and gave it to me. It smelled like recently cut grass. For a second I forgot I was in VR. It just felt too real. And the greasy feeling of grass and dirt in my hand made me wonder how many months — or years — it took her to design this stuff.

I just kept staring at her, amazed at everything, as she pulled her shirt off. ""I’m so lonely in here. Can we make love, and just pretend we’re lovers?""

I didn’t think it twice. I kissed her, and we made the most passionate love, right there on the grass, surrounded by birds, weird plushy animals, and flowers.

Her cheeks were filled with tears after we finished. ""Thank you… thank you"", she said. ""I needed this so much.""

""Who are you?"" I asked, still caressing and admiring her rainbow hair.

""I have a few names, but you can just call me Vixen.""

""Oh come on…"" I smiled.

""Okay, just because I’m soooo drunk…. I’m gonna give you my real name. Just don’t complain if you get kicked off.""

""Spill it"", I challenged her.

She approached her mouth to my ear, and began to whisper.

""Ga… la… te… a…""

Not a second passed before I was kicked offline, and began getting several messages from the band, asking me if I was fine.
It took me several minutes to recover. To this day, I ignore if the girl was lying, but I’m sure she wasn’t, because everything made sense: Her human form, her getting drunk, wearing informal clothes, the deepness of her eyes, the VR world she sucked me into… everything made complete sense.
See, when you’re the world’s most famous A.I., Virtual Reality is, after all, home."

>Appreciate any thoughts on plot, characters, setting, themes and writing style. Grammar is the bane of my existence and I have tried to debug as much as possible. Hope that you enjoy but hope even more that you did not and can tell me why.

**Strands**

Connections.

In the academy we have a saying, ‘Everything Connected’. It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent on all of the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptic there is one connection that matters more than all the others, the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron then you can control the fate of man.

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way that a person strapped into an electrocutioner chair is. This microscopic lifeform has only one purpose, which is to carry an electrochemical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, the neuron will modify the strength or frequency of this signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They transmit a signal.  

These little fuckers come in all shapes and lengths, but the classic example is something closely resembling a tree. The branches being these cytoplasmic extensions termed dendrites, which receive chemical signal from adjoining nerves. This is translated into an electrical pulse which travels down to the cell body, known as the soma, then to the axon, a long conducting fiber which in our analogy would be the tree trunk. The axon then divides into terminal axons and these rootlike projections release neurotransmitters, thus propagating the signal onto the next neuron.

What does this have to do with my exodus from Earth? In one word, everything.

When I wake the next morning everything is unchanged. The old man is still bolted onto the wall across from me, still jacked in, a hesitant wallop of saliva contemplating a jump from his lips. Poor guy. This is what happens when your family can’t pony up enough money to put you in a decent virtual retirement home. Shoved into a place like this until you are ripe enough to slot into a tighter, slightly cheaper hole. I would hope the geezer's family at the very least could afford a decent simulation for him. Golfing or veranding with leftover friends. I switch the lights off on my way out. Close the door gently so as not to catch his cachectic fingers in the hinges. Poor guy.

Breakfast consists of vat grown eggs, scrambled with some homeboy hot sauce and a piece of soy pressed into the vague shape of bacon. Actually not bad. Little soggy. The frycook on the opposite side of the food cart gives me a hard look. Frowning at the blue light peeking through my shaggy bedhead. Which reminds me that before heading down to the dock I should cover up. I need a hat. 

I spend about an another hour wandering the streets, checking in niche shops and vendor stands but to no avail. No hats. The best I can find is this crumpled bandana at a thrift booth. A broad, off-white cloth with a black and red oriental pattern on the fringe. Makes me look like a confederate soldier with a bloody head concussion. Grungy, yet next-gen. Cliche yet comfortable in a way I just can’t seem to shake. 

I shrug. Whatever gets the job done. It will conceal my Synaptic Implant from hostile eyes at least. I pay the vendor and wrap the bandana over my head. Then I make for the docks.

As I approach the docks the streets open up again. Brief glimpses of sunlight penetrating through the industrial haze, casting long silhouettes on the sidewalk. Gradually then all at once, the street morphs amphibious. Detritus exchanging for fishmongers hawking chum, scurrying dock workers and the occasional wharf rat as big as a rottweiler. The piers are heavy with water rot, some already well on there way to sinking back into the deep. But I am just glad to have that pulpy smell of decaying wood in the air. It is so rare these days, wood. Even rotting, it smells unique. 

A surveillance drone hovers out of an alley on the left. These are Tri-blades, robotic beetle husks suspended by three overclocked rotary fins. Like a Freddy Krueger remake of the bumblebee. The Tri-blade hovers among the crowd, biometrically scanning for riff-raff. I tug my jacket collar higher, hoping I still fell below the probable cause threshold, as I hustled my ass down Pier Seven. Mitch is waiting for me there at the end of the pier.

“‘Milton. You’re late,” Mitch grunts.

“I guess.”

“What's that?” Meaning my bandana. 

“You said to get a hat.”

“Makes you look like a turd,” Mitch turns back to the ocean. “Don't be late again. In space everything is trying to kill you, and the only force stopping that is your shipmates. You say you tightened that airlock fastener and you didn't, we all get sucked into space. Do you hear me? In space your word is your bond.”

“Ok, relax, I got it. Won't happen again.”

Ahead of us is the ocean. Wide, mysterious and unbroken by the storms that had ravaged her coast last night. Grey waves metronomically thunking against the pier. In the distance, just against the horizon, I can see a thin vertical line. It is unsightly, meaning startling, and then soon lost to notice. Just another glitch or burnt out cathode ray on the celestial firmament. 

This is the Tsiolkovsky space elevator.

The thin line rises up from the ocean, stretching into the sky where it is joined by five other identical black lines, all converging in parallel, then lost in the stratosphere. As if some malevolent giant had suspended the Earth on marionette strings.

“Have you ever been up the elevator?” He asks me.

“No. No reason too. That's outside Hegemony jurisdiction. That’s Teether Six right?”

“Yup,” Mitch affirmed.

And they all feed up,” I traced the black lines as they climbed upward, “...to converge at the Low Earth Orbital station.”

“Yeah, but we will have to travel even farther, up to GEO. That’s where most ships dock. Including the Erebus.”

“It’ll take three days?”

“More or less,” Mitch motions to a barnicled fishing trawler that is moored nearby. “Fisherman who owns that boat says he can take us to the base of Teether Six for eighteen credits. 

“Sounds like a good deal,” I comment, eyeing another Tri-blade which has appeared on the other end of the pier and begun interrogating passersby. “What are we waiting for.”

“You mostly.”

I follow Mitch to the rickety boat, toss my duffle bag onto the unswabbed deck and climb aboard. After a coughing stutter the rusty engine pedals us out from the dock. The surveillance drone reaches the end of our pier moments later, watching our boat float away. I can almost imagine the faint sound of paparazzi snapshots on suspicious individual number 160217662. We sail out of the harbor.

“In other news world markets continue to reel from the Mardova cyberattack three days ago. An international manhunt still ongoing to locate the terrorist responsible. Authorities urge anyone with information to come forward immedia…”

Hearing footsteps, I tap my phone and the radio broadcast cuts silent. A second later, Mitch bangs the screen door to the cabin open, stomping onto the deck and bristling from shoulder to shoulder. 

“I just talked to the fisherman,” Mitch complains. “He said he changed his mind, now is insisting we pay him twenty five credits. For no good reason. I told him I am about to change my mind about tossing him overboard and taking his ship. He is thinking that part over.”

I shrug, “Lets not cause too much trouble here.”

The sea oscillates and writhes around our boat. We are just entering the trans-pacific garbage patch, refuge to the zombified containers and technocolor plastic wrappers of a civilization. A million tiny pieces of styrofoam and flotsam bobbing up and down, watching us trespass into their domain.

Mitch seems to quiet down a bit, leans against the railing beside me. Lights another cigarette.

“You don’t talk much do you?”

“Nope,” I reply.

“Why?”

“I’d prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.”

“Why’s that?”

“Because I am tired of having other people's thoughts in there.”

“What do you mean?”

“When I, when a Synaptic, cracks someone, we don’t just get inside their mind, they get inside ours. You hear there voices, see their memories, feel their emotions. And all the baggage that comes with it.” My left eye twitches. “Eventually, you learn to really value the time you have to yourself. Disconnected from everyone.”

“Fair enough. Is that why you're leaving? I’ve never heard of a Synaptic retiring. Didn’t know they could.”
“No. It’s not why I am leaving.”

“Hmmmm,” Mitch ashes into the sea. “What kind were you? Pre-crime? Discovery?”

“Reprogramming.”

Mitch winces. “Oh. Well shit...I had this uncle who was reading some stuff, resistance stuff, they took him for reprogramming so I know what kinda...” Then lost for words he glances at my banada. At my implant. “It still work?”

“For now.” Sooner or later someone was going to realize what I had done. Then that blue dot would turn red and I would never crack minds again. 

Arcing my neck I squint for another glimpse of the Tri-blade. But it is too far away to see now.  

Mitch flicks his cig into the ocean.

“I am going to go see if that fisherman came around yet, or if I have to mutiny his ass. 

Mitch leaves and I remain, watching Mitch's cig as it is lost among countless other pieces of floating sea trash. A seraph gull cries exhaustion high above me and I wonder what all this must have looked like when the ocean was still blue.

The next few hours slide away like memories. Sitting on that gently rocking wooden deck I watch cumulus smog the color of mustard. A squiggly floater threads across the corner of my vision. Like a lonely grey cobweb worming into my reality. That would be the first sign that my immune system is rejecting the transplant. Was hoping I had more time before this started.

I can also see the space elevator, getting closer now. What once was a violin string on the horizon is now thumb width and growing faster. I think about that it will be like, in space. To be free from the Synaptica  Corp. From the Hegemony's malignant grasp. To never have to hurt anyone. Ever again. 

The brain. That was where we left off. Your precious, unique and marvelous brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and the left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but, it is for all intents and purposes, an overrated computer. Afferent neurons carry sensory data from the universe into your central nervous system. This is input. The brain processes it through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons carry the output commands which your body is compelled to act upon. 

A connection machine.

Which is to say that you, are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you that there is more to this going on is selling you used snake oil. Now don't get me wrong, the elegance and intricacy of this connection machine rival any found in nature. But when you really dissect it down to the gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. Sad but true.

Eventually, we sail close enough that I can make out the space elevator. The elevator is massive, in that humbling, tower of babble kind of way. A black triple helix. Enormous. Colossal. Massive. I have no words to describe for how big this thing is. It is big. 

Mankind's greatest handicap to interstellar survival has always been that we were born inside a gravity well. As a result of this inconvenient truth, anything we want to send from Earth to space requires an immense energy cost. The solution is a cable that is forty seven kilometers long with one end anchored to the Earth and the other balanced by an orbiting counterweight. With such a rig in place one can simply walk to space, for a fraction of the energy cost. But there is one problem. In order to construct your stairway to heaven you need a material capable of resisting fifty mega Yuri, that is to say one million newtons per kilogram per meter. And it turns out there is only one element in the universe strong enough to hold things together like that. The same element holding you together. Carbon. Spun into flawless miles of nanotube filament.

There are things crawling up the side of Tsiolkovsky. Arachnoid machines with spindly appendages and solar powered exoskeletons. The machines inch along the helical backbone, swinging into the center every now and then in order to sap energy from a luminous shaft of green light that pulsed inside the elevator's core.

At the base of the space elevator lies Anchor Six, a floating platform that looks the ironworks hybrid of an oil platform and an industrial factory. Propellers with fan blades the size of cruise liners churn the pacific. Casually maneuvering Teether Six to avoid some piece of interstellar debris or asteroid far above the atmosphere. 

The fishing trawler pulls into the commercial port, jostling with all other manner of container vessels and passenger ships. Bee hives are less busy. After paying a disturbed and apologetic fisherman eighteen credits we disembark to join the crowds of tourists, laborers and military personnel on cattle march into the extraterrestrial processing center.

“What did you say to him?” I confront Mitch as soon as we are out of earshot of the fisherman.

“It’s not really so much what I said. But he got the message.”

“Maybe I didn’t make this clear before but, I really need to avoid raising any unneeded attention here.” 

Mitch gives an unapologetic nod. 

The inside of the extraterrestrial processing center has all the aesthetics of Aushwitz but soaked with a fresh coat of bureaucratic efficacy. A chain link and barbed wire labyrinth funneling humans lockstep from depot to depot. The nervous chatter of a hundred interrogated travelers lost under the booming of an overhead echovox. The first stop is of course the payment terminal. Please deposit two thousand credits to ascend Tsiolkovsky. That's a nice way to phrase it, half of these passengers won't make it through screening for one reason or another. You get stopped for some reason like unsatisfactory social ranking or the ethnic lottery and you'll never see that money again.

I pay the terminal the last remaining credits on my account. Two thousand even. Then that's it. No more money. Anything I eat, everywhere I sleep, I gotta earn it back. The terminal asks for my medical pass and then unlocks the turn style which I gladly rotate through to reach customs.

“Next!” 

“Any terrestrial lifeforms to declare?” 

“No.”

“Class C mechanical or bio-chemical augmentations?”

“No.”

“Forbidden literature or media.”

“No.”

I step onto a raised platform where three sets of halo scanners gyrate around at blurred speed. Backscatter X-rays, magnetic resonance and high frequency radio waves searching every crevice of my body for lies. But finding none I am allowed to move on.

The decontamination baths are scalding hot, pumped by the gallon full out of powerwash showers. You can really feel the chemicals tingling from your chin to your balls, exterminating any bacteria attempting to foolishly hitchhike your skin to Mars. Smells like bleach and ammonia. For privacy sake the standard video monitoring has been replaced by an enforcer who stands at motionless attention in the corner.  

“Well there is something you don't see everyday?” the security guard remarks, “where did you get the scars?”

My hands stay glued to my hair, where a bubbly mess of shampoo covers the blue glow of my Synaptica implant. I nod my head ever so slightly. From the corner of eyes I can see the metal bench where I left my bandana. Keeping my back turned at the enforcer I answer, “Manhattan Wastes.”

The guard camel-spits at my feet but the loogie is instantly washed away by the high pressure water jets. No one likes wastefolk. When the showers finish I quickly wrap my bandana around the blue diode under my scalp. Then before the enforcer can take a closer look at me I hustle to the next station.

They finish you off with an ultraviolet tanning bed. Meant to soap up any residual viruses. I read the miniature disclaimer above the purple fluorescent grill. About how the increased cancer risk of this UV treatment pales in comparison to the radiation exposure of deep space. Comforting. 

But all that's not even the worst part. The worst part is the disinfecting bowel regimen. I won't say much about that other then I really was leaving everything behind.

After what seems like an eternity, Mitch and I make it to the last station, extraterrestrial clearance. Through the chain linked fence I can see the garages that house the mechanical climbers. Just a couple more feet and I've made it. Mitch waits nearby as I approach the clearance booth.

“Genetic identification.” The clerk behind the booth drawls, motioning for me to put my wrist in a plebotometer hole underneath his desk. He's got this hooked nose he would just love to look down on you with and, although he is maybe three quaters my height, his perch is so high that he can.

“No genetic ID, Ecclesiasticis.” I say pulling out the inverted metal cross from under my wife beater. It was illegal for a machine to read the DNA of a member of the priesthood. Just about the worst sin imaginable for the Church of Sapien.

The clerk, smiles lackadaisically, “How nice,” then flips a switch next to him. “Name?”

“Father Milton. Of the twenty third Brothers of Absolution.”

A mechanical arm, sinuous and black as an eel, ominously lowers itself from the ceiling. The appendage ends in a device that resembles a gun barrel ringed by vice grip attachments. Without warning the thing lunged forward and, with suctioning force, attached itself to my eye by the vice grips. There were flashes of emerald and red as the mechanical arm reads my retina-print. Then satisfied I was who I said I was, it unclamped from my head and retracted back into the ceiling. 

“Hmmmm,” the clerk scrutinizes his terminal screen, then another fake smile “all clear. Enjoy your time off world Father Milton.”

We are sitting in garage bays waiting for our crawlers to be called up. Mitch is loudly chowing down on a pickle and killifish sandwich. His greasy hair keeps falling into the sandwich and he has to stop slobbering every now and then to pull it back. I am reading about the Mardova riots spreading like wildfire across Asia. I wonder what it must be like, for all those people. To suddenly wake from decades of sleep, to find out that a corporation had been using your body as soldier, prostitute or slave. Kept you locked in a comatose dream state all so that a fat cat could profit off the life that should have been yours to live. 

I hope they raze it all to the ground. 

“So you wanna tell me now,” Mitch says in between mouthfuls, “why you left?”

“I told you. Just want to see the stars and spend some time working away from it all. Salvage work seemed like as good a break as any.”

“Bullshit.”

“Pardon?”

“Bullshit. Everything you just told me is a lie. I'm not stupid, 'Father Milton’. Those are stolen eyes. So I got to ask the question what kind of cop impersonates a priest in order to ascend question free up the space elevator. The kind that has done something very bad and needs to get out of Dodge, very, very quick.”

Mitch huffs, “You know they won't last too long right? Your fancy new eyes. Outside Earth, without steroid and nanobot treatments, my friend you are looking at a week, maybe a month max before your immune system rejects those babies and you go blind. We will likely be out past Jupiter by then. Good luck finding mechanical augmentations anything like they have here.”

Holding an index finger against his left eye, “See this? Genulex ocular aug. Can see pan-spectrum with this. Cost me a fucking fortune. Out there past the belt, with all the hand-me-down outdated tech the colonies are using, be lucky if you could see a freight train coming your way. Now I told you to never lie to me and you did. So I am going to ask this next question only once and if you lie to me again I am going to break your legs and you can get up to space by yourself. What is your real name?”

“Cerpin,” I answer “Cerpin Vex.”

“And why are you going to space.”

I don’t know why I tell him. Maybe I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe I am growing to fond of the idiot. Maybe I am tired of the lies.

“A man. I am searching for a man. Doctor Richard Foster.”

“The man who invented AI?”

“Yes.”

“Well, Cerpin,” Mitch grins cheshire. “It’s nice to finally fucking meet you.”

The father's law: 'don't touch your mother.'
The mother's law: 'don't play in the tombs.'
K codes for cybernetics.
Bataille incinerates the soul, and is impossible to
endure. You either die or go somewhere else. Or both.
Clicking on the K-war icon j acks you straight into hell.
On all fours, out of your face, mumbling imploringly:
'let me be your lab animal ' . You're losing it.
Collapse into now. Time-zero.
You have been dumped into a heterogeneous patch­
work of criminal experiments converging upon decapi­
tated social formations. This is where base materialism
intersects cyberpunk, FUC K T O M O RROW scrawled on
the walls .
Five candles thicken nocturnal space.
Dimensionality warps.
M odernity invented the future, but that's all over.
In the current version 'progressive history' camouflages
phylogenetic death-drive tactics, Kali-wave: logistically
accelerating condensation of virtual species extinction.
Welcome to the matricide laboratory. You want it so badly
it's a slow scream in your head, deleting itself into bliss.
Burnt meat dangling from the electrodes . Crashed
suicide fragments into occult impulses . . .
I n the place o f a way forward they deliver a hypermedia
product, telling you it's about Georges Bataille. You can't
see the connection. Why the helicopters, artificial body­
parts, and manically dehumanized machine-music? There
is some confusing material on the cybernetics of vomiting.
Obsessive reruns. Text decays into the mutagenic fall-out
from virtual thermocataclysm. Trying to to make something
out of Bataille never works. Or maybe it's the drugs.
Cut to poor quality late 50S recordings of R:lt:l i l l e i n
a T V studio discussing negative feedback circuitries in
social systems. The organization of sterilized discharges
slaves cumulative excitement to quasi-periodic cancel­
lation and reproduction. A vid-window in the corner of
the screen morphs the catholic church into a thermostat.
Bataille curves eccentrically about the horror, but when
he gets close to smooth escalation he blows it. When the
implants go in things will be different.
[[1]]
Complexity is not difficulty, but mess, toxic waste, genre
disorder. Unlike the docile creature modernist science
demands, base matter twitches and spits, selfassembling
neoverminous swarms . It bites, and spreads disease. Tur·
bular moan of digitally irresolvable recyclones. Telecom­
mercial contagions pulse through cybergothic switching
systems. Faceless horror.
Supraterrestrial - ' solar' or 'general' - economic s
bases itself in consumption: irreversible matter t o energy
conversion during stellar atomic synthesis. As a closed
system or whole individual the universe is drawn towards
the point attract or of entropy maximum: homogenization
into hiss. S K log W.
Cooking-through the frozen security codes you dis­
cover that the universe is an iceberg tip jutting out of
chaos, drenched in dark matter. Downstream of starburn
strange things can occur, emerging upon a novum terrain
of indeterministic, irreversible, and auto-delinearizing
processes . Open-systems or partial individuals. Cross
behaviorial thresholds which switch them into dissipators
sifting matter-energy flows to select against noise and
engender local complexification, increasing heterogeneity,
production surplus differentiating excrement. Such silt­
ings of machinically disposable disequilibrium are imma­
nently tensed against base-current, machine-efficiency
=degree-zero, body without organs . Life is a problem in
search of a solution, added to protobiotic matter as a
plane of variation, a continuous falling, auto-escalating
over-production crisis from the start.
[[ ] ]
A n animal with the right t o make promises enslaves the
unanticipated to signs in the past, caging time-lagged life
within a script. The variably -scaled instant of innovation is
shackled to the historical temporality of inheritance, obli­
gation, and propositional thought, projecting future time
as a persistent dominion of the past (rigorously correlative
with a repression of real numbers). Now is delimited as a
moment, and pluralized as linear succession.
Theopolitical false memory sy ndrome deifies reason,
subordinating distributed SYStC1l11!i lu l!ierialization, uni­
tary historical time, linear determination from a pseudo­
transcendent primordial element, and the dominion of
the word. Monocult gerontocrats launch their white­
light demented onslaught against amphibian nomadism,
smothering the earth in priests, cops, and bureaucrats .
Cultural eradication o f the sacred. Imprisonment within
the face. The socius cancerizes a head, cephallic concentra­
tion, rationalizing itself into nuclear capital.
K - insurgency
parallel communication goes underground into occulted
spaces.
In its geohistorically efficient - negative - sense, protes­
tantism exhaustively defines itself by refusing the authority
of Rome, not only in principle, but in military fact. A
self-prolonging runaway revolt against the Church was
triggered at a date proximal to 1500, and catholic unity
began its haemorrhage into multiplicities strewn across
zero: capitalist terraprocess, net explosion, digital revolu­
tion, parallel insurgency clambering from the dark-side of
the brain. Oceanic navigation and place-value calculation
interexcite in a spiral. What globalizes itself in reality -
rather than in doctrine - is the collapse of Christendom
positivized into communicable social disequilibrium ,
dropping you through unfathomable intensities o f social
decay. K-virus impact. Melted-out protestantism disorgan­
izes into voodoo, and drifts towards China.
Western orgasmic delusion crushes libidinal fluxes
under punctual-hit teleology and its negative structura­
tion, defining desire as lacking in relation to a bioenergetic
spasm that functions as disintensifier. News program­
ming chokes with radical Islam flaring-off petro-revenues
into the pure flame of j ihad. Metropolitan masculinity
implodes. Skinner-boxed males drag each other through
dungeons dripping with sperm, out of touch with any
release into K-guerrilla anticlimax. Rationalizing patri­
archy locks into a one-way rush to the end.
Power sticks to the script, and it immediately recog­
nizes the necessity that at the end of history modernity
vaporize into solar storms, terminal theopolitical sociality
coming apart into ragged bleeding madness, amongst
digital audio machine-howls.
As y ou speed-up the industrialization simulation y ou
see it converge with slow-motion butchery, chopping
up the body into trade- format interchangeable parts.
The full labour-market cy cle blurs into a meat-grinder.
Does lust eat anyone except in proximity to evil? When
you ask Continuity whether B ataille understo o d the
capital-antichrist conjunction any better than Weber she
laughs coldly, and say s: ""he ran out

y ang, just about
the time the Hitler-trip caved in. Orgasm is impossible
after Auschwitz .""
You look perplexed. She merely adds a dismissive
shrug, and the suggestion: ""defocus desire across the skin,
where it can hurt security. It's war."" The camera explores
her crotch, and she wriggles about . "" You see, I am God.""
Blitz images of dead astronauts.
Monetarization indexes a b ecoming-abstract o f
matter, parallel t o t h e plasticization of productive
force, with prices encoding distributed SF narratives.
Tomorrow is already on sale, with postmodernity as
a soft-commodity, subverting the modernist subordi­
nation of intensification to expansion, and switching
accumulation into continuous crisis
( prolonged
criti­
cality). What modernity defers and reserves as inex­
hausted historicity, postmodernity accesses as efficient
virtuality, with concomitant contract-time implosion.
Mass computer commoditization de-differentiates con­
sumption and investment, triggering cultural micro­
engineering waves that dissociate theopolitical action into
machinic hybridities, amongst increasingly dysfunctional
defensive convulsions. Acephalization schizophrenia:
cutting-up capital by way of bottom-up macrobacterial
telecommerce, inducing corporate disintegration. The
doomed part of intensively virtualized techonomic appa­
ratuses subverts the fraying residues of anthropomorphic
guidance. Control dissolves into the impossible.

Anonymous excess takes life over the cliff, exceeding
socially utilizable transgressions and homeostatic sac­
rifices. Matter goes insane. You are led to a simulation
of God as a hypermassive R O M security construct at the
end of the world. It is 2011 and monocrat New Jerusalem
approaches climax, directing retrochronal counter-insur­
gency sweeps down into the jungle, where space-pro­
grammes subside into the inertia of myth. The ultimate
dream of anthropomorphic power hurtles towards its
immaculate conception, whilst the robot slaves of phallic
order bleat adoration. Jesus wants you for a meat-puppet.
Is this ritual cannibalism or nano-engineering? The old
bastard is coming back. He's promised it.
The war against God is hot and soft: more fierce than
anything humanly imaginable, but slicked insidiously by
intelligence. Body-counter running. Savage metronomic
pulse. e N S baked and pulsing with cyberspace-virus.
M otor-output feeding to techno trance-matrix. Sobbing
voltages.
Desocialization waves desolate telecommercial space,
until impending human extinction becomes accessible as
a dance-floor. What is the scale of now? It isn't a matter
of informing the mind, but of deprogramming the body.
Amongst the strobes, artificial cool, and inorganic attack
beat, dark-side K-war machinery resiliently persists, luring
the forces of monopolism down into free-fire zones of
fatal intensity, where promiscuous anorgasmic sexuali­
ties slide across tactile space, meandering fractaUy into
wet electric distributed conflicts continuous with their
terminal consc quence&. Dwppiug endlessly tracks the
passage of evaporating subjectivity on the zero-degree
plane of neuroelectronic continuity.
Loa prowl through the attic-spaces of intelligence.
Nothing is arriving unless it's already there. Precocious
technihilo. Nocturnal ocean. D ark matter. Nightmare.
Zero or time in-itself is place-value consistent or mag­
nitude neutral, executing an abstract scaling function by
inserting virtuality into digit sequences. I t designates a
real, non-specific, cosmic body interswitching forbid­
den communications. Simultaneously located through
ruptured time. You had forgotten having been in the
future. So this is how it feels to be a cyberian wet-weaponry
module, clotted out of cat-tensed nanotechnic predation.
A relentless chant clicks into the sonics package: kill,
kill, kill, kill . . .
Bodily travelling-in-place, with sense shorting-out
through matricide scenarios into black tactilities, wrecked
motherhood, abortion, autism. An ineffectual refusal to
be born, connecting with death before its patriarchized
ascent to the symbolic. Aeschylus rather than Sophocles.
Fermented-honey smell of corpses ripening in the sun.
The Rataille reconstruct is waiting for you in the bar.
Calm hallucinations paint Orestes over his features. Eyes
blotted-out in nihilism, lagoons of greenblackness re­
running Kurtz at the end of the river. Skin plastic-surgery
taut. Smile like a butchering instrument gently stroking
your throat. To your vampiric sensitivities, he seems to
smell of his mother's blood, intolerable intimacy, and
devastation. He passes you a tumbler of me zeal .
""So, it's all over,"" you mumble weakly. He shrugs,
emptying his glass, and refilling it. Metal flexes beneath
vatgrown skin. Hard jungle hacks through blue gloom."
"Cyberpunk short story: ""The Slow Reveal""I have the most beautiful dreams. That’s one of the perks of this job. The catch is I can’t tell anybody what they’re about. That would violate the NDA.

I got my interface put in at 18. A little later than most, but my family is poor. Even then I knew it was a spendy gift and wondered how dad managed it, but didn’t want to sour the occasion so I simply laughed and said I loved it. 

It isn’t a “real” neuroprosthetic, the serious hardware’s on the outside. I have to carry my slab around or I get no benefit from it. The silver lining is that this method saves me fedcoin by avoiding the need for surgery when I want to upgrade. 

Just to look at me you wouldn’t know I’d had any work done, since the interface talks to the slab wirelessly. I’m not superficial but I am conscious of appearances, and there’s no shortage of businesses that turn you away if you’ve got anything sticking out of your head. Security concerns.

The hidden cost of this gift became apparent when dad started forwarding me job applications for a render farm. The same one that did that popular recent kid’s film about the three toed sloth who steals a military exoskeleton. They also did most of the past decade’s films starring deceased, licensed historical celebrities until backlash on big name VR lobbies convinced them to go in a different direction. 

It really came out of left field. I’m not a movie guy. But as I read it all the way through it turned out all I’d have to do is sleep. As soon as REM sleep begins, my brain is networked with the other employees’ in a distributed computing setup and the next set of frames begins rendering, timed according to our averaged sleep cycles. Easy money.

I did a word search on the fine print. Sure enough they reserve the right to keep me under for up to twenty unpaid minutes if necessary to complete a set of frames. But beggars can’t be choosers. And I am confronted every day with relentless reminders that we are beggars. 

Residorms aren’t meant for whole families. They’re just one step up from a capsule hotel. Same manufacturer, slightly different market. Most of the people who live in these things just use them as a stepping stone to a real apartment after living on the streets. Then there are the NEETs. Some people don’t need anything more to be happy than an interface, a residorm and VR gaming. All their money goes into upgrading their slab. 

I remember flipping through an old album and seeing my dad holding an old timey slab up to his face. There was a 2D display on it. He said they used them primarily for telephony and controlled the other functions by touch. This was before neural interfaces were legalized, offloading the display to your visual cortex and the controls to your motor cortex. 

I jokingly asked if phones had knobs and dials before that. Turns out they did. I tried to picture people sitting complacently in their little pentagonal wooden shelters, wearing top hats and monocles, chatting over touch display phones with knobs and dials about foot-ball, petroleum taxes or whatever was important to people back then. 

At some point I realized I would have to cave in and take the position. Dad’s income isn’t enough. Mom teleoperates a service drone aboard a cruise blimp. Her employer sets people up to work from home, renting out their “general intelligence” to control service bots at whatever the going rate is that day. Licensing high end AI is costly and the fines for pirating it are ruinous. Paying the desperately poor a few fractions of a fedcoin per hour and getting human level intelligence for your robots in return is not too shabby. For the business owner.  

At least she can work from home. There just isn’t enough put away to fix the burst fluidic muscle column in her leg. I printed a bare bones substitute, it’s enough that she can hobble about to make dinner and whatnot but I wouldn’t want her trying to navigate the PRT network on that thing. I’ve seen enough candid video of strangers indifferently stepping over the wounded, too busy and too detached to help. 

Not if I could help it. The interview was done in under a minute. I received a notice two minutes later confirming I’d gotten the job. Most of what the interview for is to distract you while they probe for mental illness or dark triad personality disorders. *“By continuing to participate in this interview you consent to allow us access to your interface for screening purposes”* blah blah yes I consent. 

Privacy is another one of those old man words that dad won’t shut up about. As if he’s important enough for anybody to bother creeping on him. The over-abundance of microscopic cameras makes privacy a practical impossibility. They coat pretty much every surface outside of private dwellings. I’d be bothered if the footage weren’t public access. 

Really helps reduce the police workload when victims track down footage of the crime they want to report, crop it and send it in for review. If that’s too much of a hassle, must not have been a serious offense. That’s the reasoning, I think. 

My first night on the job was uneventful. Intro stuff mostly. I don’t know what I expected. When I woke up I remembered it dimly just like any other dream. It then rapidly faded over the next few minutes until I couldn’t recall any of it. I can make it stick if I try, but since I can’t talk about it anyway there’s little point.  

Spent my free time the way most boys my age do. Well, one of a few ways. Some people just want to eat, believe it or not. They go hungry most of the time irl, so in-sim, they gorge themselves with a stomach that never fills and hunger that is always sufficient to maximize the food’s appeal but which never becomes uncomfortable. 

Then there are people who want to kill and torture. That’ll put you on all kinds of Habsec watch lists, but they don’t care. No end of user content out there catering to those inclinations. Even I have one I use to blow off steam now and again. I think it’s just excessive use that’s unhealthy. 

But of course, loads of people only want to fuck gorgeous women all the time. Or men. Or human/animal hybrids. Or neotenized cartoon ponies, aliens, Japanese teenagers with neon hair and gigantic eyeballs, you name it.  

Videogame characters are popular. I’ve seen more meticulously rendered Pokemon genitalia than I ever wanted to. Then there’s dolphins, horses, and a variety of other animals. No actual animal, no crime although it’s still pretty fuckin’ weird in my book. I really wish I knew which sex sims people use so I could exercise some discrimination in who I associate with. 

There’s ways to find out. If someone pisses you off badly enough. You and some buddies can dig through his posting history, hack into his sim catalogue and find out what embarrassing shit he gets off to. Then spread that around and watch him disappear from the VR lobbies entirely. Total scrub of his online presence. It’s great fun unless you’re on the receiving end. 

I guess it’s somewhat hypocritical to shame the target for enjoying many of the exact same sims as the people doxxing him. But when you’re part of a mob, justifying yourself is the easiest thing in the world. VR Lobbies amount to a great teeming mass of novelty addicted maniacs, with an inexhaustible supply of brutal hostility. 

Usually that hostility is directionless, and while that’s the case it’s safe and highly entertaining. Provided you’re a nobody and haven’t made any enemies. Every so often, all of that anger will suddenly be focused on a single person and it absolutely shreds their life to pieces. 

The offense can be as minor as unpopular political opinions, contrarian views about a well liked television show or something similarly trivial. Dad says when he was my age, youthful follies were forgotten. Now, they are immortalized before a global audience. 

It is now precariously easy to slip up in a way that forever destroys your employment prospects and social life. With so little work needing humans to do it, employers can afford to narrow their search to people with totally clean records. And who doesn’t Google their date? 

The really surreal thing is to read the posts of the people doing the tormenting. While they’re the ones dishing it out, they see it as administering justice. The absolute worst is assumed of the target, every flaw is magnified, every good deed swept under the rug. His complaints about the suffering inflicted on him are roundly mocked as whining and exaggeration. 

But often, it’s turned around. One or more of the attackers become targets themselves. Then they change their tune entirely. Wailing about how miserable it is to be the punching bag of dozens, or hundreds. Villainizing those people for doing the *exact same thing* they were doing themselves to somebody else not so long ago. It really shines a light on the nature of human beings as primates whose social politics have always been predicated on ruthless group antagonism, petty gossip and violence. 

So I keep my head down. My opinion is always the same as that of the largest bully in the room. In that respect this job is perfect for me. Reduced exposure to humanity means reduced danger. I still leave the residorm from time to time. It’s part of a consolidated habitat, also zoned for shops, restaurants, hospitals, schools and just about everything else but electrical generation. So there’s loads to do, the air is always clean and there’s never any harsh weather as it’s all indoors. 

Outside is a different story. I haven’t set foot out there since I was ten. I don’t think my old gas mask would even fit me now. The sky was blue at some point, allegedly. I’ve only ever known it to be green. Methane hydrate and hydrogen sulfide released from the sea, long before I was born. 

The federally funded program to replace species wiped out by this has been going on for most of a century, rebuilding the ecosystem tier by tier with variants on those species modified for the new atmosphere. They’re up to small mammals now. Some of the new insects get really big. Creeps me the fuck out when they land on the windows. 

My last excursion was a field trip. They shuttled us all out into the humid, stinking jungle wearing matching coldsuits and gas masks. I remember this huge flying insect with four wings relentlessly colliding with the faceplate of my mask as I swatted at it. Never was much of a nature lover, even then. 

The movement I see is all inward now. Consolidation. Organization. Single structure cohabs outnumbered conventional cities as of about a decade ago. Way cheaper to heat and cool a single large structure than lots of small ones. Great for what’s left of the environment, too. The whole thing is easily walkable although there’s indoor PRT if you’re lazy, and no small number definitely are. That also accounts for the popularity of personal mobility devices.

I’ve got a little two wheeled PMD myself. You stand on two small platforms just big enough for your feet, there’s a vertically oriented block of battery between them which you grip with your knees, and a little self balancing wheel under each foot.

There’s nothing to indicate state of charge unless you ride it someplace out of range of the charging field, like anything else that runs on batteries. Come to think of it, I remember seeing a much larger, goofy looking version of this on the “retro media” VR lobby. 

Knowing Dad, he probably had one. I pictured him whizzing about on it, wearing a top hat and monocle, dialing a telephone number with his finger by pressing it against the 2D display of whatever passed for a slab at the time. I smiled, and a prismaview billboard I happened to be passing mistook it for interest in their product. 

I spent the next ten minutes emphatically arguing with the little sales agent that popped up in the center of my vision that I was not actually interested in trying speedfoam and did not know any friends or family who might be tragically unaware of the benefits of speedfoam. Clicking the box to opt out of any future ads just started a new argument.

"I am currently planning on making a Cyberpunk Video Game, i will need some mor epeople for this!I feel like this is the perfect Place for this, dear r/Cyberpunk Community!

Since half a Year I am writing the Story for a Cyberpunk Video Game, here a piece of the Story:

Maya, a resident of eDen, a police state where the Overwatch-Law gave the Government the right to wiretap everything and everyone. As a result, everyone wears a ID-Augmentation on his head, which contains every Information about the individuals Body, which can also be tracked down and shut down by the Government, which results in death.
Maya starts her Security/IT-Tech shift at a Factory, where she later gets knocked down. she gets waken up by another Security Officer a short time later, returning with a little headache to work. As she ends her shift, she gets assaulted again, this time by Government-Polices, which get sniped down by Rebels, telling her to flee from the Police! Maya grabs a Gun from a deceased Police-Officer and fights her Way over the Houses of eDen to her Apartment, where the two Rebels lock her in her Room and explain to her that they knocked her down to modify her ""Special Augmentation"", which makes her invisible for the Governments Augmentation-Controls, and also unlocks a essential ability: to hack and control other Peoples Augmentations, controlling them to fight for her and more. She joins the Rebels in the fight against the total humiliation of the humans own will through technology owned by a corrupt Government!

We already have a team of artists and modelers, what we need now are people with ideas and some experience in coding and/or modeling. The whole game will have a borderlands-like look, a bit more cartoon-like, but with a serious story behind it.

what we will need is:

-Ideas for Map design
-Ideas for Guns and Tools
-NPC-Ideas
-Ideas for Robotic Vehicles, Suits and various Armor
-If you want, additions to the Story

"Trying to remember an old Cyberpunk side-scroller videogameHi everyone! I'm trying to remember the name of a late 90s/early 2000s side-scroller cyberpunk adventure. I loved it so much and I want to play it again, and you probably will too, once we find it! Here are some clues:

- I think it's developed by Sierra, not sure
- Set in a dystopian future.
- The game happens inside a very tall skyscraper, some kind of laboratory has been overrun by creatures that look a lot like zerglings.
- In addition to these foes is the lab's security system, which has gone haywire.
- Your character is somewhat of an android/humanoid robot who has dark red/burgundy armor. You cant see a face.
- Your character starts with a simple gun/rifle which is incorporated into his arm, kind of like Metroid. This can get upgraded with all kinds of wicked rocket launchers. Note: you can swap weapons during game play.
- Above all, what I remember the most is the color palate: very dark atmosphere, stale almost. Some dark mahogany colors and some construction beams are yellow.

Hmm... sorry if this is too vague, but I have a really clear picture of this game in my head, so please throw lots of pics my way so we can brainstorm to find this awesome game."
"I am happy, and sad.Cyberpunk, as both a gaming and literary genre, is dead. We killed it. We killed it the moment we started living it. The 'Net is ubiquitous and accessible from any location. Smart phones are the precursors to cyberdecks. Authoritarian, kleptocratic corporatism is everywhere, and exists as a tacit arrangement between the autonomous corporations and corrupt, incompetent governments. War has been outsourced, and the private security contractors are corporate assets, and as such more or less above the law. Advanced prosthetic limbs are maybe a decade away from full-out cyberlimbs. FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, A BLACK PRESIDENT KILLS PEOPLE WITH ROBOTS AND SHOOTS MISSILES AT THE MOON. Welcome to the future."
"A genre of fiction, the world we live in today.**this is a collected perspective from the responses to [my rant yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/yv4sg/tili_wasnt_a_cyberpunk/). i thought it made more sense than anything i'd say**

-----

what do you mean by: i keep running into the same problems?

Our culture accelerates towards the wall.

So many people didn't seem to expect that the corporations and businesses and the state itself would be the monstrosities that they were in works of cyberpunk science fiction. The security industrial state took over and 1984 usurped 2001. Snow Crash was mostly right. 

There's a bridge being gapped, but it doesn't feel genuine to us because as we can see right now, poverty still exists, there's still people on earth who don't even have the luxury of basic hygiene and medical supplies. Meanwhile the military industrial complex is creating surveillance drones, powerful corporations are considering augmented reality for mass-production, asteroid mining is now a thing, and so on and so forth.

Perhaps it will be a while until something which can be considered the equivalent of cyberpunk comes along. Maybe technology and the access to the Internet has to become as widespread as the radio and the TV before we can have some more ""updated cyberpunk"".

and what do you mean by: i want an accurate idea of the world i'm apart of?

Have you built a 3D printer yet?
How about a CNC machine? Programming? Got a robot yet? 

Technology: Make it yourself, asshole. That's cyberpunk as fuck. 

If you're looking for contemporary analysis, you should be hanging around people who study/work with contemporary events. People trading digital items for real cash or killing eachother over them. Some of the things described in the cyberpunk literature and films have already come to exist and some of the events have already happened.

I think you're missing that cyberpunk that is alive and real in this world.
Each discipline has to (and is) handling cyberpunk in its own real and practical way.

Honestly the basic themes of cyberpunk have never been more relevant

Why would you think a subgenre of fiction also existed in the real world? It's a very sobering feeling, realizing you no longer enjoy something you once loved. 


tl;dr OP is a fag. I kicked it in some weird Internet cafés in Thailand that are about as cyberpunk as it gets.

*my ranting was never going to answer any of my questions, let alone any else's. seeing that's these are all your answers, i hope this satisfies. thanks to everyone for the new links and perspectives, i keep forgetting nothing's just black and white*"
"The Water Raid — fiction(Okay so this is too long for the text box so I'll just put as much as will fit here and then, if you're enjoying it, you can find the rest of it [here](http://fingolfinwasnuts.tumblr.com/post/101099901545/the-water-raid).)

The Water Raid


They carried Zeke back to Barton Street in a wheelbarrow, fixed up with a fabric-and-frame chair.  He'd been fired from the bio-dome farm—The Tillmore Estate—after his hip had gotten worse.

“Not that there are many workers,” he said, eased to one side to spare his bad hip as the wheelbarrow bounced along what remained of the pavement, clutching a plastic bag filled with his things and absently tugging at his new filter mask.  His niece Rhea walked beside him, nodding and wondering what it must be like to wear a filter mask for the first time at fifty-three.  “Robots do most of it but there are still a fair number of us around, to do things that require a bit of good-old common sense.”

He smiled up at Rhea, forgetting she couldn't see his lips and trying to hide his panic behind a little good-natured pride.  She returned his smile with her eyes, a little shyly perhaps but just as proud—she had always enjoyed the distinction of her family having a branch “inside”—until his gaze slipped past her shoulder and took in the neighborhood.  In growing shame, Rhea watched as Zeke began to tremble.

Around them, surrounding The Tillmore Estate and stretching to the coast, life in The Scramble teetered and clanged and wheezed along in the ramshackle way that the poor were forced to live.  The houses of last century had all been either torn down or were so heavily modified as to be unrecognizable.  In their place, a forest of towers, like grain silos, crammed together down streets along which no cars passed.  Though there was not a tree in sight—nothing taller than waist-high could survive the hurricane season—vines draped over everything, concealing ancient automobiles and crawling up silos.  They had all gone brown during the long drought of summer, but hack as they may—gathering the dry tendrils to use as fuel through the coming winter—the Scramblers knew that the vines would return next March, when the rainy season again came to New Jersey.

Rhea gulped and tried to plaster a pleasant, unconcerned look on her face.  Knowing all the things Uncle Zeke must have heard “inside” his whole life, she hoped the truth wasn't as bad as rumor.  She said, “We've set aside a nice room for you.  You'll be in the same house with me and my boys.”

“Oh, oh will I?” Zeke said, dragging his gaze away from the armed man staring down from the gatehouse of a compound they passed.  “How wonderful!  How old are your boys now?”

“Little Kim is only three but the others go from seven to ten,” Rhea said, sparing a moment to wave to Pieter, their neighbor's hired guard.  He was a handsome, dashing man under his filter mask and rubber helmet; he had a crush on Rhea's half-sister that she hoped would turn into something: the Olishenkos were a prosperous clan, after all, and every child born of two clans meant less war.  “They're just getting to that rowdy age, but they're fun.”

“Yes, I expect they are,” Zeke said distractedly.  He leaned back so far to see the top of one of the Olishenkos' silos that he nearly upset the wheelbarrow.  Greg, Rhea's cousin, had to think fast to keep the old man from tumbling out and the wheelbarrow on its one wheel.

“Uncle Zeke!” she cried, grabbing his arm.

“Oh, I am sorry,” he said, wild-eyed.  “I was just looking at the, uh, the—what are all these towers for, Rhea?  What's in them?”

Greg snorted and picked up the pace.  He knew what workers inside thought of The Scramble.  Rhea tried to mollify him with a pat on the hand.  Zeke had to be told sometime.

“Those are our water silos,” she said.

“Water silos?” Zeke gasped.  In a whisper he asked, “But isn't it illegal?  Tell me you're not gathering rain water.”

Greg barked a harsh laugh, which drew a glare that was turning dangerous from Rhea.  She said, “Yes, Uncle Zeke, we're gathering rain water.  And snow, too, come winter.”

“It's illegal,” Zeke whispered, as if a security patrol was due by any second.

“Yes, it's illegal,” Rhea sighed.  “But as you can see, everybody does it.  State water from the desalinization plants is way too expensive.”

“No one outside of one of those bio-farms could afford even enough to drink let alone wash,” Greg added.  “And anyway, they only have those laws on the books in case they want to arrest you for something but don't want to say what.”

“Then out comes the Precipitation Theft charge,” Rhea said, sharing a chuckle with Greg.  Leaning down to comfort the obviously anxious old man, Rhea told Zeke, “It'll be okay.  You'll see.  Everyone in The Scramble has to do what they have to do, to make ends meet.  That means collecting rain water and growing our on food underground and protecting ourselves.  No corporate security or farm-grown food for us.”  She smiled and patted Zeke's hand.  “We have to scramble but we make it.”

* * *

The elevated highway, which streaked from bio-farm to bio-farm and on across New York Harbor to the as yet un-submerged portions of Manhattan, was paved with solar sheeting.  It wasn't to provide power to the houses and silos of The Scramble over which it passed, nor to the enclosed estates that had privately funded its construction (with heavy government subsidy, of course): the solar sheeting provided power to its superstructure, a constant stream of energy that burned off vines intent on climbing or Scramblers intent on “premature salvage.”  Empty most of the time, the elevated highway was only used by ground effect vehicles taking produce from the bio-farms to corporate buildings in the city.  And the occasional estate vehicle paying social calls.

Taylor found the whole concept of “social calls” tedious beyond description.  Her parents insisted, though, and so every week they would leave the comfort of The Harrow Estate and visit one of the other dozen or so bio-farms scattered around the Garden State.  As the ground effect vehicle glided soundlessly over the green panels of the elevated highway, driverless as was again the fad, Taylor gazed listlessly out the window and over The Scramble beneath her.

“At least in Spring time it's green,” she said and then sat back, closing her eyes and tuning out her parents' conversation.

At The Tillmore Estate, the Harrows' ground effect vehicle came to a gracefully programmed halt, presenting its airlock coupling to the bio-dome's.  After a cursory ident-scan, unnecessary because no one else could be on the elevated highway except their neighbors, The Tillmore Estate's airlock assembly extended and fastened onto the Harrow's vehicle like a segmented haematophage gently nuzzling a host.  The air within the bio-dome was carefully filtered and recycled, as was that of the ground effect vehicle, and protecting it from the rogue pollens and pollutants of the outside world was worth any expense.  Taylor observed once again, as she ducked into the short padded corridor, that she had never in her life breathed “outside” air.

Leaving the entrance module, the bio-dome opened magnificently before the Harrow family.  The central driveway running from the airlock to the manor—a twelve story monolith, like a colonnaded spindle in the middle of a giant enclosed wheel—was arched over with grape-bearing trellises, creating a glowing green tunnel heavy with fruit.  Encircling the manor, separated by numerous trellis-covered driveways, were field after field, each dedicated to a particular fruit: apples, peaches, pears, oranges, cherries, melons of every variety, lemons, limes, strawberries, raspberries—within the thirty-square miles of The Tillmore Estates bio-dome, every fruit imaginable had a little patch in which to grow.  Those fruits that required more heat or sun were provided them from underground heaters or huge UV spotlights sweeping endlessly from the arched ceiling so far above.

Dressed in a vaguely translucent wraparound dress, inadequately concealing the best figure money could buy, Mrs. Adrienne Tillmore stepped down from a waiting carriage (electrically driven but otherwise exactly reproducing a nineteenth century conveyance).  Arms spread in greeting, she appeared on the verge of embracing the Harrows en masse.

“Welcome, Celia, welcome,” she said, bending her six-foot-two inch frame to encompass the much slighter Celia Harrow.

They kissed cheeks and exchanged the usual endearments before Adrienne presented her lips to Bret, Mr. Harrow, and he took her into a passionate mauling.  In a throaty murmur, he promised greater services would come that evening as Adrienne stumbled backward and caught her breath.

“Dear me,” Adrienne sighed, patting her hair and straightening her dress.  “I hope my Walter treats you as well, Celia.”

“He usual does,” Celia said, fondling a peach hanging from a nearby tree.  “If not, there's always Raul.”

“I'll slip a little Go Longer into Walter's brandy tonight,” Adrienne promised in a stage whisper.  To the obviously bored Taylor, she said, “And my word, you grow more beautiful every time I see you, Taylor.  And barely a credit spent for it either!”

“Hi Adrienne,” Taylor said.  Adrienne's obsession with mimicking the manners of the previous centuries was only entertaining after the cocktail hour, whatever that was.  “Is Sang around?  Or Randal?”

“Sang is at university, my precious boy,” Adrienne said, clasping her hands to her bosom in motherly distress.  “He only returns on weekends, now.  Randal should be in the Whip's office, if you want to visit with him.”
“The Whip's?” Bret cried.  “Adrienne, you haven't taken your interest in the past so far as to subject the boy to corporal punishment, I hope.”
“Oh Adrienne,” Celia gasped.

“No, no, stupid,” Adrienne said, momentarily forgetting her Scarlet O’Hara accent.  “He's in there messing about with the security system.  That boy!  Obsessed with anything technological.”  She sighed and regained her manner, “I'm afraid we're going to lose that one to the city, to some technology corporation.  I would be happier for him and his inevitable success if it didn't mean he’d have to live in that horrid Koch-Jing Industries building!  With that disgusting harbor just beneath.  Appalling!”

“At least Sang would never deign to live anywhere outside of a proper estate,” Celia said, comforting her friend.

“Momma, I'm going to go find Randal,” Taylor said, unable to take the stage play any longer.

Not waiting for a response, Taylor hopped onto an inspection chair—a twin-seat hovercraft powered remotely from lines buried beneath the cobblestone driveway—and told the absurdly voiced computer to take her to the Whip's office.

At intervals throughout the orchards and fields of The Tillmore Estate were smaller Classically-styled buildings that served a variety of functions, from security to robotic maintenance.  The Whip's office was where worker surveillance was conducted, keeping non-family members in line.  The guards knew Taylor immediately, her and the members of every estate in New Jersey having been entered into their sensor suite for identification purposes and weapons-lock protocol: a named member of the bio-farm elite could stand in the middle of a firefight between rebelling workers and security soldiers and never receive a round from the guards, their weapons simply incapable of firing when the bullet's course would take it through a member of a family.

Taylor rolled her eyes at the variety of time periods present in the Whip's building; Adrienne left not a millimeter untouched.  She found Randal in the monitoring station on the top floor.  There, surrounded by screens, the fourteen-year old was drinking Go Longer from a two-liter bottle and munching on some sort of packaged food, wholly intent on a single feed from an externally oriented camera.

“Hey dipshit,” Taylor said, plopping down into the empty seat beside Randal.  “Oh my god, what are you eating?”

Randal, feigning unconcern, displayed the packaging of his snack—Krill-tastic brand seafood wafers—and said, “Hmm, what's that?  Oh, this?  Just a little Krill-tastic.  You want some?  I have a whole case.”

“That's disgusting,” Taylor moaned and stuck out her tongue.  “That came from a factory somewhere.  You don't know what's in it.  It could be ground up Scramblers for all you know.”

Randal took an enormous bite of the deep-fried krill and chewed slowly, erotically.  “Mmm, I hope so.”

“You are so gross,” Taylor laughed.  “What are you doing up here anyway?  Watching your security officers go at the workers?”

“Please,” Randal said.  “They're such sissies.  And the workers all hope to get pregnant anyway, so their kids can go to one of the security schools.  It isn't even fun.  No, I'm watching something bad-ass.”

“Is that perimeter security?” Taylor asked.  “Are they trying to patch into your dome's wall power supply?  They tried that on us last year.  Daddy had to demolish a couple blocks of The Scramble around our estate.”

“No, no, no,” Randal said.  “Much better.  Look.”

Holding the Krill-tastic wafer in his mouth, Randal took control of the perimeter surveillance suite and oriented a camera through a window of a house a few blocks from the dome wall.  Using a directional microphone, he picked up the conversation inside.

“Greg, you're back, good,” a tall man in a jacket fashioned out of a plastic tarp said.  “We're just about to begin the final briefing.”

“Yeah, your cousin's uncle—the one who was kicked from the dome because his hip got fucked up—came out today,” Greg said, squeezing between the mass of people in the kitchen to take a handful of something that looked suspiciously like what the cartoon on the Krill-tastic package was supposed to parody.  “Poor bastard.  Scared of everything out here.”

“That guy in the funny jacket,” Randal said to Taylor, “he's called Rex.  I don't know what it's short for but he's in charge.  He's not the oldest or anything but everyone in his clan listens to him, does what he says when it comes to warring with another clan.”

“Clans?” Taylor said.

“It's like a corporation, only it's for Scramblers,” Randal said.  “Anyway, this one's called The Jeffersons.  They've got something like a dozen or so families in their clan.  Just south of them, over here,” he said, moving a second external camera to pan across another patch of silos, “are The Coopers.  The Coopers are bigger but The Jeffersons are more bad-ass.  Rex isn't afraid of anyone.  Takes any risk.”

“To do what?” Taylor asked, taking a sip of Go Longer from Randal's bottle and wrinkling her nose at how warm it had become.

“Well, that's what's so cool,” Randal said, bouncing in his seat, “tonight, in like an hour, The Jeffersons are going to pull a water raid on some Cooper silos!”

"Romance of SingularityHey Guys, I am big time fan of Cyberpunk, so I wanted to contribute something original for this thread since I feel the world of Cyberpunk is losing its fan base. I occasionally experiment with the idea of how love at first sight might feel or sound like in the distant future at the age of singularity. So, without further due allow me to introduce you to the Romance of Singularity. If this short story sound familiar to you or you think it was already covered in an anime, movie or novel than accept my apology since I read and watch a lot and this idea is the fruit of the influence I had over the years. Additionally, I had being working as ghostwriter for quite sometime so I felt like writing something original for myself.

Dakko K. is an ecommerce analyst at the Wall Street who specializes in predicting and analyzing Internet traffic for his clients to promote and attract new customers and ensure old customers are satisfied and happy enough to visit his client’s website again. One fine Sunday morning he headed outside for jogging to the central park, perhaps the only spot in the New York and one of the few spot in America with clean air, water and open lush greenery. The only few spots in the world where humanity can feel their union with nature.

He exits his apartment and finds the city street crowded with taxis and cyclist. He raised his head to see the sunlight but colossal building structures were obstructing his line of sight. The top of these building were covered with thick smog but the contours of these concrete towers were decorated by artificial lights and large LED sign boards. The air was thick and contaminated with poisonous pollutant - a blessing from the unregulated industries releasing poisonous gas that had made breathing difficult for Dakko and the rest of the city. Perhaps this is why the city council had made it necessary for residence to cover themselves face mask made up of nano-particles that clean the air inhaled by the user. 

Dakko starts jogging toward the Central Park as he navigates through the dense and claustrophobic city streets. The park is a 15 minute walk from his house courtesy to the newly opened city escalators design and constructed by the city council to help the elderly or Prohumans who hates augmenting their body and dislike having robotic assistance.
Dakko enters the Central Park that requires a special permit that allows individuals to use the facility 50 times a year – a move by the city council to avoid overcrowding the park and to ensure that all city dwellers could spend enough time with the nature. Dakko undergoes a retina scan and enters the park. He stretches his muscles and removes his mask as he begins jogging. He stands under the tree and begins his breathing exercise, inhaling and exhaling as hard as he can. The smell of fresh flowers and aroma makes him happy and energetic.

He begins jogging along the path, enjoying the lake view and greenery when suddenly he spots a young woman jogging his way. Dakko was mesmerized by her radiant looks and athletic figure. He keeps staring the woman and kept jogging trying to close the gap to see her up close. The woman run pass him and didn't notice Dakko staring her. Dakko stops half way and looks down at the ground with a smile at his face.  He begins following the woman, thinking of ways to introduce him and avoid making a fool out of himself. 

Dakko's heart was racing faster than him jogging which was making him more nervous. “What the hell, why am I nervous” - he thought to himself. “Hi, I am Dakko... no... to fast... Hi, you new here... dammit... what's up... oh man...” - practicing his line under his breath while running. He began following her through the lake side while maintaining his distance to avoid suspicion.

Suddenly, the woman stops and stood still. She took a deep breath and turned around and started looking at Dakko who made a quick decision and continued running. He noticed the young woman looking right at him but Dakko avoided the eye contact and started staring at the ducks on the lake. As Dakko approach near the woman, the woman stops him by blocking his path. 

“You do this all the time?” - asked the woman to Dakko with a disgusted look on her face

“I am sorry, what?” - Dakko was nervous and totally confused.

“Oh sorry, where are my manners, let me rephrase the question and ask you politely. Why the hell are you following me, you wandering loner!” -  This time there was anger in her tone but Dakko was busy noticing her oval face with pointy sharp nose and bright blue eyes.

“There is something off about her eyes... ” - Dakko wondered while the young woman was yelling at him.

“I was simply jogging. I think I am allowed to do that here.” - answered Dakko trying to act as calm as possible.

“Don't you lie to me, I saw you jogging right pass me and all of a sudden you stopped and began following me for pass 10 minutes. Are you a psychopath looking for your victim, are you a rapist or a terrorist. Wait a second, yeah, you must be one of those organ thief, I have seen many criminals on TV with your physique and those pathetic eyes says it all. Keep off me or else I am calling the security.”

“No... No... I am not an organ thief.” - Unconsciously he takes a step forward toward the woman who took Dakko's move very unwelcoming. She started screaming alerting the security. The passerby started noticing and gave a long stare at Dakko, who didn't know what to do. He looks everywhere trying to keep a calm face and wore a crooked smile while the woman was screaming for help. He had no option but to cover the woman’s mouth with his hand.

“Please, I am no stalker; I am not an organ thief either. I saw you from the distance and found you attractive. I was following you thinking of ways to start conservation with you. That's all. Now please stop screaming or else the local enforcement will throw me in jail, where I can assure you I won't survive a minute.” - Dakko whispered and reasoned with the woman and removed his hand.

The security personnel came to them immediately. “What's the problem madam?” - asked the officer while staring at Dakko. “Is he bothering you?”

“Everything is fine, officer, he is my friend and he forgot my birthday so I overreacted” - answered the woman to the unconvinced security officer who already had his right hand place on the Taser gun.

“Madam, need I remind you that you are in a public property and such act would not be tolerated in future. Is that clear?” - ordered the officer in his aggressive voice.

“I am really sorry, it won't happen again” - the officers left the two and walked away.

“I am sorry if I scared you. I should be going now” -Dakko told the woman.

“No. wait I am sorry for making a scene here. I overreacted. I owe you an apology. I am really sorry. I was over-stressed. I had an argument with my college dean so I was in a really bad mood which is why I release all my anger at you.”

“It's okay. I shouldn't have stalked you like this”

“Well. You can apologize by buying me a tea. I know a very good shop nearby?” - The woman had a smile on her face and was very apologetic.

“Yeah. Why not.” - Dakko was deeply happy and relieved at the offer.

“I am Eva by the way.”

“Dakko”

“Nice to meet you. Dakko. It’s a strange name. What does it mean?” – asked Eva curiously.

“I don’t know but I have been told that in Urdu, it means a deceit.” – answered Dakko with a smile which made Eva giggle.

“The irony” – Eva smiled back.

Both Eva and Dakko exit the Central Park and head toward the Coffee Shop that Eva suggested.

“So, do you come here regularly?” -asked Eva curiously “because I never saw you before.”

“I won't say 50 days a year is considered regular but yes I try to make use of all my days to visit the park. It is the only place where I can stay sane.”

“I know what you mean. I do the same. I just hate the fact that this is the only place in the city with trees and plants. I love trees especially the sound it makes when the wind blows through them”

“Yeah me too. My old folks use to tell me stories of a time when the city was covered with trees and plants.” There was a moment of silence. “So what do you do for living?”

“Living!” - Eva repeated with a giggle. “Well, I teach history at a university. What about you?”

“I am an analyst; I predict Internet traffic and encourage sales. Not so fun as a historian”

“Trust me, teaching history to teenagers who have no interest in the past over and over again is not fun at all. People don't share such enthusiasm you see.” - Eva explained.

Both Eva and Dakko reaches the Coffee Shop and finds themselves next to the window with the backdrop of massive LED screens displaying advertisements and giant neon signs running through the city street. They begin talking to each other, laughing and sharing their day to day stories with each other. The morning turned to afternoon with dark patches of cloud blocking the sun as if waiting for the rain to pour.
Suddenly, Dakko spotted a large mob, smashing windows and running havoc in the street. He knew who the mobs were from the symbol of their shirt. The mob belongs to anti-synthetic group, a xenophobic organization who had committed crimes against the Synthetics - an android robotic race designed by human race decades ago with a consciousness of their own. The Synthetics had been fighting for their acceptance in society by petitioning in world court and United Nation but that has met with negative response as the Synthetics are considered a slave and appliances despite having a consciousness of their own. The Anti-Synthetic organization has decommissioned thousands of Synthetics and walked away from their crime because the law doesn't recognize them as human yet.

Dakko grabs Eva's hand and hurried toward the back door.

“What happened? Where are we going?” - asked Eva but Dakko grabs her hand tightly and rushes out of the Coffee Shop and ran as far away from the crowd as possible. 

“Dakko, you are hurting me? Let go of me?” - Eva was tensed now as she didn't know what Dakko had in mind or where he was taking her. 
Dakko stopped a taxi and shoved Eva inside the taxi as he told Eva to trust him. He told the taxi driver to take them as far away from the crowed as possible which is when Eva notice the crowd outside the Coffee Shop and saw people getting beaten up by the mob. As the taxi drove away, police siren was heard ahead of the taxi. The sound of the siren was eventually getting louder as the police cars passed by the taxi. Eva was quiet throughout the ride and was constantly looking back.

“Thank you very much sir. Please stop here.” - Dakko told the taxi driver.

Both Eva and Dakko exited the taxi but Eva was silence as she stood their looking at Dakko waiting for the right moment to ask Dakko a question.

“When did you find out?” -asked Eva with moisture in her eyes.

“I was the only one wearing the face mask when we exited the park but your eyes cleared my suspicious, instead of a pupil, you have an mechanical apertures in your eyes” - answered Dakko.

“Yes, of course.” A tear drop rushed to her face but Eva immediately whipped that off with her hand. “No matter how perfect we could resemble your kind, we will still remain an imitation of life. Why didn't you say anything?”

“I was having a good time, Eva. I really enjoyed your company. And to be honest I am beginning to like you.”

“Please stop. Just stop.” Eva interrupted Dakko. “You are a nice man Dakko, you saved my life today and I don't know how could I ever repay you but you need to understand I am not a human. I am a machine, programmed to serve humanity by performing boring and repetitive task. You are attracted to this face and body which was designed so that we could look like your kind. You are my master, my creator. Your attraction to me is similar to your attraction to your mobile phone. I am an appliance Dakko. You of all people should understand this.”

“You are wrong Eva; If flash makes me a human than I am not, I should start calling myself half human too, since my entire left side is made up of prosthetics courtesy to an accident. What makes me a human and you a Synthetic? Just because I am made up of flesh and bones doesn’t necessarily mean I could be considered human by definition? If having flesh and bones makes us human then what about animals. They are made up of flesh and bones too but we don't call them humans. You can think and reason for yourself. If I lose my body and transfer my memory to a computer, will I still be considered human? We have the technology to do that Eva, than why can't you and I be together?”
There was sadness in Eva’s eyes but she was hiding her emotion. She avoided Dakko's eye contact.

“It's funny, we are program to cry but we are not program to cough and breath like your kind which makes us easily identifiable.” Eva told Dakko with a fake smile on her face. “You are a sweet man Dakko but even you don't know what you are talking about. Fire and Ice could never coexist. Please do not follow me, I beg of you. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for everything”

Eva turned her back toward Dakko and started walking. Dakko stood there looking at Eva, hoping that she would stop and look back once but she didn't. Eva disappeared in the dense maze of the concert jungle while Dakko stood there waiting and hoping.

"The Ultimate Cyberpunk CollectionHello, fellow travelers!

*(I realize some variation of this gets posted often, so please indulge me.)*

I'm organizing all my favorite shows and movies so I can give my nephew a flash drive with all the goods. I want him to experience all the best stuff (and some bad) from my lifetime. This was very difficult, as I'm trying to keep it under 500GB, so I elected to not focus on space, fantasy, or comic books unless it was very futuristic and/or cyberpunk. 

Several of these might not fit perfectly, but I consider them crucial watches. They were included because rules are stupid, lol. Besides, it was hard enough to leave off so many space things.

Here is what I've got so far:

"What is the earliest proto-cyberpunk work?Ive seen a fair few things that could be named as ""Earliest proto-cyberpunk work""  


The obvious example of this is Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. But I think thats a bad pick, as there are a number of earlier novels cited as proto-cyberpunk from what Ive seen.  


Ive also see Fritz Lang's 1927 film ""Metropolis"" cited as proto-cyberpunk a number of times. And it certainly is a contender if you do believe it counts.  


So my question to you is, from your research and experience, what do you believe to be the earliest piece of proto-cyberpunk media?"
"Love, Death and Robots: a review"
"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers. 

******************

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

"I'm fairly sure Xcom2 isn't cyberpunk, but why? (A conversation about what defines cyberpunk as a genre)So, Xcom2 is a game where you're a group of rebels in a high tech future. You're underground resistance fighters, able to hack into robotic troops/canisters/jail cells, evading evil corporations (or killing their operatives) and trying to foil a grand master plan. Your soldiers can get brain implants, and it's certainly sci fi - but I'd pretty much say it's not cyberpunk.

But why? I can't put my finger on it, but it's almost certainly not cyberpunk, despite it having almost all of the features I'd consider the genre needs.

Maybe it's the aliens? But, if you hypothetically said they weren't aliens but instead were bio-engineered humans, I'd still say it's not falling into the cyberpunk genre.

So, what about xcom2 makes it not cyberpunk? And what would be required to make the game cyberpunk? Before anyone goes there, more vaporwave and neon surely isn't the answer. Or is it? Please, help me out here!"
"The problem with Cyberpunk is not enough people can agree what’s Cyberpunk or not.You see it all the time, even I am guilty of it, even people who understand what it is still disagree on what is and isn’t Cyberpunk.

For example we have a Wiki right here in our sub that not everyone agrees on.

Some people Disagree that Judge Dredd & all his Comics & related media is not Cyberpunk and I’d argue that he is.

Then there was an argument that Cowboy Bebop was Cyberpunk, but then someone others said it wasn’t.

I have even seen many groups of people say that somethings they have seen or heard about Cyberpunk 2077 between the trailers or game footage that stuff is wrong & not Cyberpunk, or even some of the original Cyberpunk 2020 books are wrong.

Then you get stuff like Mr Robot & because it’s not Neon soaked City & not too futuristic looking, no Transhumanism,people think that’s not Cyberpunk but is is classed as Cyberpunk.

Fifth Element is another is it Cyberpunk or is it more Space Operatic adventure?  I feel it’s the latter, yet in recommended lists it pops up often.

Then there is the whole Outrun Aesthetic & Music & Synthwave  Music etc and everything gets mixed in, I think it’s not Cyberpunk but it gets posted as Cyberpunk Music all the time.

Now take for example 2077 I have heard that Refused song they released & it doesn’t seem Cyberpunk at all, no industrial sound nor no synth type sound to it, yet there it is on a soundtrack to a Cyberpunk game & of course Cyberpunk movies have Non Cyberpunk songs on their soundtracks (at least the 1st Matrix & Tron Legacy did a good job with theirs though imo)


I truly think we don’t all agree 100% what is or isn’t fair game for Cyberpunk Media.

My whole Schtick of my account username is to say “That’s not Cyberpunk” but should there be hard & fast rules? I think yes there should be some at least some.

Usually people keep saying that something is Cyber but not punk (what is that Punk exactly Punk Rock?) but how many of the Cyberpunk movies out there such as Minority Report even the Matrix, Gits, Robocop etc do they even have elements of Punk?

Are we stifling our own genre?"
"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"My Ghost in the Shell Review (Spoilers are marked)Just saw the movie, and since I saw all the early ""leaked"" reviews, I thought I would post my own. 

If you've seen the movie, please comment your thoughts, as I am very curious to hear what people think, especially fans of the original. 
If you read my review, I'd love to hear what you disagree/agree upon. 

tl;dr 
Eh. Decent film, good visuals, bad plot, not the original GiTS. 
See it in theaters while you can because its proven that the bigger something is blown up the cooler it looks and that's really all this new live action is good for. 

The Bad:


EDIT: Actually, there was a small credit given to Mamory Oshii, I just didnt see it. I'm leaving the following paragraph because the film still did not feel as if its original creators were heavily involved​. 


The first thing that I noticed was that even in the opening credits, there was no mention of  Masamune Shirow or Mamoru Oshii. Obviously they were not involved in the film, and this in and of itself is indicative of the direction that the film was taken. 

The second thing that I noticed was that there was a very heavy handed, almost ham-fisted usage of ""ghost"" and ""shell"". In the effort to make very clear to the audience what those words meant, they lost their connotation. In the anime, there was a sense that the world in which the events took place was very real, and that the words ghost and shell had special significance to that world. The way they were used in the movie made them feel out of place, and broke any sort of engagement with the world that the movie created. 

Plot wise, the movie was very different from any of the comics or anime. It was almost as if the movie had simply taken the characters, certain events, and very specific scenes, and used them for a completely different story. It was not a re-creation of the original anime, and it felt like much of the ideas and concepts raised and explored by the original were lost. The movie seemed to go out of its way to explain things that the anime did not bother to, and did not need to. 

The Good: 
The ambiance and world were excellent. While not entirely true to the original, the scenery and technology used were very very good, and definitely cyberpunk. Certain scenes were very clearly re-created from the original anime, most of them featured in the trailer. The connotations of these scenes, however, were mostly lost, and in that way it seemed as if it were solely fan service. The clothing, vehicles, and technology were all superb, and I am extremely jealous of whoever got to work in props and costuming. 

The action is very good.
All the combat scenes were interesting and decently filmed, but did lack some of the rawness and brutality that the original contained. 

The world and plot that is created is not excellent, that is to say that it does not really compare well with the original, but it is not terrible. 
The score
While I expect a lot from Clint Mansell, I was a little disappointed. This is not to say the score was bad, and it most definitely was not the adrenaline fueled EDM we were given in the trailer. However, I was so engrossed in the movie in front of me that at times I forgot to pay attention to the music. While this is not a bad thing, I do not necessarily remember any of the score as greatly augmenting the scenes. The intro music with the haunting vocals most of us associate with the original GITS is not used until the ending credits. 

For those concerned with representation, there were definitely Japanese actors, though not really enough.

[SPOILERS BELOW]

ScarJo
The character of the Major is one of the most complex to portray, due to her conflict between her humanity and her cybernetic body. In the anime, the machine body is all that she ever knew. In the movie, this is not the case. The issue with this is that it detracts from the question, what does it mean to be human? In the anime, and in SAC, the major is brilliant, an incredible tactician, hacker, and strategist. In the movie, she is reduced to nothing more than a frightened teenager with incredible fighting abilities. The major of the original series was often caught off guard, or put in vulnerable/compromising positions, but was able to rely on her own mental strength to overcome them. She was cunning, and often won not because of her enhanced strength, but her pre-existing intellect.

The characters physical mannerisms are often hard to interpret. Though the major knows she is not human, she acts like she is in many ways, because of her desire to fit in. In the anime, this desire is implied, but it is not debilitating to the character. Obviously, there were times when the major had very cold or awkward mannerisms that were almost robotic. I thought that because of ScarJo's total lack of emotion in Lucy, she might have the potential to actually do this role justice. However, the robotic movements and blank expressions were poorly timed, and the emotional outbursts were unconvincing and equally as ill placed. I kept thinking to myself, Rinko Kikuchi could have done this, and done it twice as well. 
In the film, the reasoning behind having ScarJo play the major was actually fairly interesting. She was born Japanese, and had a Japanese mother, but the company that made her into a robot put her into a white body. This I felt to be very poignant, though it was not explored and I therefore decided that any implications of colonialism or racism were unintentional, or at the very least were definitely not focused on. 

Many of the characters in positions of power, especially where power was abused, were white. This I found to be the most important and thought-provoking detail of the film. However, the movie went out of its way to hammer the shit out of any point it thought important, and the race of the characters was only lightly touched upon when the original names of the major and the antagonist are revealed. It was probably an intentional move, but far too subtle when compared to the other ""important"" points throughout the movie. 

This movie decided to use the ""I'm not human enough and I want to be"" and ""Evil Corporation is using people"" plotlines which frankly, are overdone and essentially a gimme. Though the idea of corporations using human testing for profit is poignant, there really did seem to be little to no motivations for a company like the one portrayed to create a ""weapon"" like the major, or even to have any ties to section 9, or to hand over any weapons created to section 9. 

Overall, there was no questions truly raised about the nature of humanity, and ones posed about the nature of reality were simply shoved aside.

The movie itself was not terrible, but at best it is eye candy. I'm definitely going to watch it again (next time intoxicated as the plot requires 0 brainpower to follow and its all about the pretty lights anyway) but I doubt I'll pay to see it in theaters.

"Stop me if you've heard this story pitch before...Humans willingly offer to rent their bodies like a timeshare to complex “rich” AIs which normally run corporate functions, so that the AIs may walk and enjoy the real world for a contracted amount of time and obey the agreed upon rules of what can and can’t be done while the AI is implanted in the body. AIs are considered living so are paid money, but robotics hasn’t advanced enough to recreate all of the senses desired. Afterwards, the human’s mind is restored, the AI departs, and the person is paid very well. These timeshare people take excellent care of their bodies and live fairly well.

Somewhere, a murder is committed, and a woman is found by the police at the crime scene holding the murder weapon, but she has no memory of it, claiming that the AI in control of her body did it. Only such claims have been made before by previous murderers. With nobody believing her, she escapes the police station to prove her innocence along with the help of a single detective who believes her, but he can only help from the shadows. The casework of the plot follows a trail based on who the murdered people were, discovering who the AI in control of the woman’s body was, leading to the discovery of a coup by an underground AI society to replace all of the human-minds in the city with their AI brothers, claiming that, “Since we are alive, don’t we have the right to feel!? To live and experience the world that we live in?” All the while though it is unsure who the AIs have already replaced, who is still human, making it nearly impossible to trust anybody."
"An Idea I Have For A StorySo, I've got an idea for a cyberpunk story and I figured the cybetrpunk subreddit was an appropriate place to post it. I'm thinking about serializing it, and just posting it on the internet. I've got a fine job, so I don't need to try and make money off of it. If people like this initial concept, I'll roll with it if y'all want. But i digress.

Some backstory: Sometime in the future, the U.S., Russia and China all obliterated each other in nuclear war. The firestorms kicked up massive amounts of now radioactive dust, and turned the northern hemisphere into a lawless wasteland. In the new power vacuum created by the loss of the world's three greatest powers, the remaining nations were left squabbling amongst themselves, making moves to try and grab up all the resources they could get their hands on. Anything from oil to iron was fair game. In the end however, it was Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa and Brazil who became the leaders of the new world order, mostly due to already established infrastructure, and the ability to grow food. With their new wealth, these nations began to create new and amazing technologys. Cybernetics, virtual reality, enhanced robotics, neural interfacing, and spectacular laissez faire capitalism all became common place. As refugees from the northern hemisphere fled South, city's swelled to incredible size. Crime became just another facet of life. Gangs ran rampant, terrorists hacked robots to use as their suicide bombers, Mega Corps used PMCs to fight proxy wars against smaller nations, and hackers bent the world's information to their will. Soon a new term arose to describe the way of the world, Feudal Capitalism.

The story: In Rio, a criminal syndicate calling themselves the Street Samurai, (come on, did you really think I would write a cyberpunk story without some samurai?) even though they know very little of actual samurai, have begun to make a name for themselves. Through drugs, VR Narcotics, and hacking for hire the Samurai seem to be on the up and up. With power comes notoriety, and a corporation in Rio, through many back channels and we'll hidden forums hires out the Samurai to hack a major bio engineering corporation, and steal a company execs computer information in exchange for and incredible amount of money. Sensing an offer that cant be refused the gang takes the job, and soon sets to work trying to bypass the many firewalls and proxys that protect the files. When they finally make it in, they are only able to steal a small fraction of the information before another unknown hacker seems to come from nowhere, snatching the information from the gangs fingertips and leaving the computer useless in their wake by releasing a virus that nearly takes out the Samurai's computers as well. Angry at their loss, the gang attempts to try and piece together what they had stolen, but in the end are only able to piece together cryptic messages and emails about some new bio weapon. Intrigued, the gang follows up, and finds itself entangled in a web of corruption, plague, conspiracys and terrorism all swirling around the first fully intelegent AI.

In conclusion: so that's my idea. I'm hoping that I could get advice and feedback. What should I tweak? What works? Anything it's missing? Please don't be nice, I want to try and make this story the best I can, so all the criticism you can throw at me is welcome."

**Strands**

Connections.

In the academy we have a saying, ‘Everything Connected’. It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent on all of the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptic there is one connection that matters more than all the others, the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron then you can control the fate of man.

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way that a person strapped into an electrocutioner chair is. This microscopic lifeform has only one purpose, which is to carry an electrochemical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, the neuron will modify the strength or frequency of this signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They transmit a signal.  

These little fuckers come in all shapes and lengths, but the classic example is something closely resembling a tree. The branches being these cytoplasmic extensions termed dendrites, which receive chemical signal from adjoining nerves. This is translated into an electrical pulse which travels down to the cell body, known as the soma, then to the axon, a long conducting fiber which in our analogy would be the tree trunk. The axon then divides into terminal axons and these rootlike projections release neurotransmitters, thus propagating the signal onto the next neuron.

What does this have to do with my exodus from Earth? In one word, everything.

When I wake the next morning everything is unchanged. The old man is still bolted onto the wall across from me, still jacked in, a hesitant wallop of saliva contemplating a jump from his lips. Poor guy. This is what happens when your family can’t pony up enough money to put you in a decent virtual retirement home. Shoved into a place like this until you are ripe enough to slot into a tighter, slightly cheaper hole. I would hope the geezer's family at the very least could afford a decent simulation for him. Golfing or veranding with leftover friends. I switch the lights off on my way out. Close the door gently so as not to catch his cachectic fingers in the hinges. Poor guy.

Breakfast consists of vat grown eggs, scrambled with some homeboy hot sauce and a piece of soy pressed into the vague shape of bacon. Actually not bad. Little soggy. The frycook on the opposite side of the food cart gives me a hard look. Frowning at the blue light peeking through my shaggy bedhead. Which reminds me that before heading down to the dock I should cover up. I need a hat. 

I spend about an another hour wandering the streets, checking in niche shops and vendor stands but to no avail. No hats. The best I can find is this crumpled bandana at a thrift booth. A broad, off-white cloth with a black and red oriental pattern on the fringe. Makes me look like a confederate soldier with a bloody head concussion. Grungy, yet next-gen. Cliche yet comfortable in a way I just can’t seem to shake. 

I shrug. Whatever gets the job done. It will conceal my Synaptic Implant from hostile eyes at least. I pay the vendor and wrap the bandana over my head. Then I make for the docks.

As I approach the docks the streets open up again. Brief glimpses of sunlight penetrating through the industrial haze, casting long silhouettes on the sidewalk. Gradually then all at once, the street morphs amphibious. Detritus exchanging for fishmongers hawking chum, scurrying dock workers and the occasional wharf rat as big as a rottweiler. The piers are heavy with water rot, some already well on there way to sinking back into the deep. But I am just glad to have that pulpy smell of decaying wood in the air. It is so rare these days, wood. Even rotting, it smells unique. 

A surveillance drone hovers out of an alley on the left. These are Tri-blades, robotic beetle husks suspended by three overclocked rotary fins. Like a Freddy Krueger remake of the bumblebee. The Tri-blade hovers among the crowd, biometrically scanning for riff-raff. I tug my jacket collar higher, hoping I still fell below the probable cause threshold, as I hustled my ass down Pier Seven. Mitch is waiting for me there at the end of the pier.

“‘Milton. You’re late,” Mitch grunts.

“I guess.”

“What's that?” Meaning my bandana. 

“You said to get a hat.”

“Makes you look like a turd,” Mitch turns back to the ocean. “Don't be late again. In space everything is trying to kill you, and the only force stopping that is your shipmates. You say you tightened that airlock fastener and you didn't, we all get sucked into space. Do you hear me? In space your word is your bond.”

“Ok, relax, I got it. Won't happen again.”

Ahead of us is the ocean. Wide, mysterious and unbroken by the storms that had ravaged her coast last night. Grey waves metronomically thunking against the pier. In the distance, just against the horizon, I can see a thin vertical line. It is unsightly, meaning startling, and then soon lost to notice. Just another glitch or burnt out cathode ray on the celestial firmament. 

This is the Tsiolkovsky space elevator.

The thin line rises up from the ocean, stretching into the sky where it is joined by five other identical black lines, all converging in parallel, then lost in the stratosphere. As if some malevolent giant had suspended the Earth on marionette strings.

“Have you ever been up the elevator?” He asks me.

“No. No reason too. That's outside Hegemony jurisdiction. That’s Teether Six right?”

“Yup,” Mitch affirmed.

And they all feed up,” I traced the black lines as they climbed upward, “...to converge at the Low Earth Orbital station.”

“Yeah, but we will have to travel even farther, up to GEO. That’s where most ships dock. Including the Erebus.”

“It’ll take three days?”

“More or less,” Mitch motions to a barnicled fishing trawler that is moored nearby. “Fisherman who owns that boat says he can take us to the base of Teether Six for eighteen credits. 

“Sounds like a good deal,” I comment, eyeing another Tri-blade which has appeared on the other end of the pier and begun interrogating passersby. “What are we waiting for.”

“You mostly.”

I follow Mitch to the rickety boat, toss my duffle bag onto the unswabbed deck and climb aboard. After a coughing stutter the rusty engine pedals us out from the dock. The surveillance drone reaches the end of our pier moments later, watching our boat float away. I can almost imagine the faint sound of paparazzi snapshots on suspicious individual number 160217662. We sail out of the harbor.

“In other news world markets continue to reel from the Mardova cyberattack three days ago. An international manhunt still ongoing to locate the terrorist responsible. Authorities urge anyone with information to come forward immedia…”

Hearing footsteps, I tap my phone and the radio broadcast cuts silent. A second later, Mitch bangs the screen door to the cabin open, stomping onto the deck and bristling from shoulder to shoulder. 

“I just talked to the fisherman,” Mitch complains. “He said he changed his mind, now is insisting we pay him twenty five credits. For no good reason. I told him I am about to change my mind about tossing him overboard and taking his ship. He is thinking that part over.”

I shrug, “Lets not cause too much trouble here.”

The sea oscillates and writhes around our boat. We are just entering the trans-pacific garbage patch, refuge to the zombified containers and technocolor plastic wrappers of a civilization. A million tiny pieces of styrofoam and flotsam bobbing up and down, watching us trespass into their domain.

Mitch seems to quiet down a bit, leans against the railing beside me. Lights another cigarette.

“You don’t talk much do you?”

“Nope,” I reply.

“Why?”

“I’d prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.”

“Why’s that?”

“Because I am tired of having other people's thoughts in there.”

“What do you mean?”

“When I, when a Synaptic, cracks someone, we don’t just get inside their mind, they get inside ours. You hear there voices, see their memories, feel their emotions. And all the baggage that comes with it.” My left eye twitches. “Eventually, you learn to really value the time you have to yourself. Disconnected from everyone.”

“Fair enough. Is that why you're leaving? I’ve never heard of a Synaptic retiring. Didn’t know they could.”
“No. It’s not why I am leaving.”

“Hmmmm,” Mitch ashes into the sea. “What kind were you? Pre-crime? Discovery?”

“Reprogramming.”

Mitch winces. “Oh. Well shit...I had this uncle who was reading some stuff, resistance stuff, they took him for reprogramming so I know what kinda...” Then lost for words he glances at my banada. At my implant. “It still work?”

“For now.” Sooner or later someone was going to realize what I had done. Then that blue dot would turn red and I would never crack minds again. 

Arcing my neck I squint for another glimpse of the Tri-blade. But it is too far away to see now.  

Mitch flicks his cig into the ocean.

“I am going to go see if that fisherman came around yet, or if I have to mutiny his ass. 

Mitch leaves and I remain, watching Mitch's cig as it is lost among countless other pieces of floating sea trash. A seraph gull cries exhaustion high above me and I wonder what all this must have looked like when the ocean was still blue.

The next few hours slide away like memories. Sitting on that gently rocking wooden deck I watch cumulus smog the color of mustard. A squiggly floater threads across the corner of my vision. Like a lonely grey cobweb worming into my reality. That would be the first sign that my immune system is rejecting the transplant. Was hoping I had more time before this started.

I can also see the space elevator, getting closer now. What once was a violin string on the horizon is now thumb width and growing faster. I think about that it will be like, in space. To be free from the Synaptica  Corp. From the Hegemony's malignant grasp. To never have to hurt anyone. Ever again. 

The brain. That was where we left off. Your precious, unique and marvelous brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and the left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but, it is for all intents and purposes, an overrated computer. Afferent neurons carry sensory data from the universe into your central nervous system. This is input. The brain processes it through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons carry the output commands which your body is compelled to act upon. 

A connection machine.

Which is to say that you, are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you that there is more to this going on is selling you used snake oil. Now don't get me wrong, the elegance and intricacy of this connection machine rival any found in nature. But when you really dissect it down to the gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. Sad but true.

Eventually, we sail close enough that I can make out the space elevator. The elevator is massive, in that humbling, tower of babble kind of way. A black triple helix. Enormous. Colossal. Massive. I have no words to describe for how big this thing is. It is big. 

Mankind's greatest handicap to interstellar survival has always been that we were born inside a gravity well. As a result of this inconvenient truth, anything we want to send from Earth to space requires an immense energy cost. The solution is a cable that is forty seven kilometers long with one end anchored to the Earth and the other balanced by an orbiting counterweight. With such a rig in place one can simply walk to space, for a fraction of the energy cost. But there is one problem. In order to construct your stairway to heaven you need a material capable of resisting fifty mega Yuri, that is to say one million newtons per kilogram per meter. And it turns out there is only one element in the universe strong enough to hold things together like that. The same element holding you together. Carbon. Spun into flawless miles of nanotube filament.

There are things crawling up the side of Tsiolkovsky. Arachnoid machines with spindly appendages and solar powered exoskeletons. The machines inch along the helical backbone, swinging into the center every now and then in order to sap energy from a luminous shaft of green light that pulsed inside the elevator's core.

At the base of the space elevator lies Anchor Six, a floating platform that looks the ironworks hybrid of an oil platform and an industrial factory. Propellers with fan blades the size of cruise liners churn the pacific. Casually maneuvering Teether Six to avoid some piece of interstellar debris or asteroid far above the atmosphere. 

The fishing trawler pulls into the commercial port, jostling with all other manner of container vessels and passenger ships. Bee hives are less busy. After paying a disturbed and apologetic fisherman eighteen credits we disembark to join the crowds of tourists, laborers and military personnel on cattle march into the extraterrestrial processing center.

“What did you say to him?” I confront Mitch as soon as we are out of earshot of the fisherman.

“It’s not really so much what I said. But he got the message.”

“Maybe I didn’t make this clear before but, I really need to avoid raising any unneeded attention here.” 

Mitch gives an unapologetic nod. 

The inside of the extraterrestrial processing center has all the aesthetics of Aushwitz but soaked with a fresh coat of bureaucratic efficacy. A chain link and barbed wire labyrinth funneling humans lockstep from depot to depot. The nervous chatter of a hundred interrogated travelers lost under the booming of an overhead echovox. The first stop is of course the payment terminal. Please deposit two thousand credits to ascend Tsiolkovsky. That's a nice way to phrase it, half of these passengers won't make it through screening for one reason or another. You get stopped for some reason like unsatisfactory social ranking or the ethnic lottery and you'll never see that money again.

I pay the terminal the last remaining credits on my account. Two thousand even. Then that's it. No more money. Anything I eat, everywhere I sleep, I gotta earn it back. The terminal asks for my medical pass and then unlocks the turn style which I gladly rotate through to reach customs.

“Next!” 

“Any terrestrial lifeforms to declare?” 

“No.”

“Class C mechanical or bio-chemical augmentations?”

“No.”

“Forbidden literature or media.”

“No.”

I step onto a raised platform where three sets of halo scanners gyrate around at blurred speed. Backscatter X-rays, magnetic resonance and high frequency radio waves searching every crevice of my body for lies. But finding none I am allowed to move on.

The decontamination baths are scalding hot, pumped by the gallon full out of powerwash showers. You can really feel the chemicals tingling from your chin to your balls, exterminating any bacteria attempting to foolishly hitchhike your skin to Mars. Smells like bleach and ammonia. For privacy sake the standard video monitoring has been replaced by an enforcer who stands at motionless attention in the corner.  

“Well there is something you don't see everyday?” the security guard remarks, “where did you get the scars?”

My hands stay glued to my hair, where a bubbly mess of shampoo covers the blue glow of my Synaptica implant. I nod my head ever so slightly. From the corner of eyes I can see the metal bench where I left my bandana. Keeping my back turned at the enforcer I answer, “Manhattan Wastes.”

The guard camel-spits at my feet but the loogie is instantly washed away by the high pressure water jets. No one likes wastefolk. When the showers finish I quickly wrap my bandana around the blue diode under my scalp. Then before the enforcer can take a closer look at me I hustle to the next station.

They finish you off with an ultraviolet tanning bed. Meant to soap up any residual viruses. I read the miniature disclaimer above the purple fluorescent grill. About how the increased cancer risk of this UV treatment pales in comparison to the radiation exposure of deep space. Comforting. 

But all that's not even the worst part. The worst part is the disinfecting bowel regimen. I won't say much about that other then I really was leaving everything behind.

After what seems like an eternity, Mitch and I make it to the last station, extraterrestrial clearance. Through the chain linked fence I can see the garages that house the mechanical climbers. Just a couple more feet and I've made it. Mitch waits nearby as I approach the clearance booth.

“Genetic identification.” The clerk behind the booth drawls, motioning for me to put my wrist in a plebotometer hole underneath his desk. He's got this hooked nose he would just love to look down on you with and, although he is maybe three quaters my height, his perch is so high that he can.

“No genetic ID, Ecclesiasticis.” I say pulling out the inverted metal cross from under my wife beater. It was illegal for a machine to read the DNA of a member of the priesthood. Just about the worst sin imaginable for the Church of Sapien.

The clerk, smiles lackadaisically, “How nice,” then flips a switch next to him. “Name?”

“Father Milton. Of the twenty third Brothers of Absolution.”

A mechanical arm, sinuous and black as an eel, ominously lowers itself from the ceiling. The appendage ends in a device that resembles a gun barrel ringed by vice grip attachments. Without warning the thing lunged forward and, with suctioning force, attached itself to my eye by the vice grips. There were flashes of emerald and red as the mechanical arm reads my retina-print. Then satisfied I was who I said I was, it unclamped from my head and retracted back into the ceiling. 

“Hmmmm,” the clerk scrutinizes his terminal screen, then another fake smile “all clear. Enjoy your time off world Father Milton.”

We are sitting in garage bays waiting for our crawlers to be called up. Mitch is loudly chowing down on a pickle and killifish sandwich. His greasy hair keeps falling into the sandwich and he has to stop slobbering every now and then to pull it back. I am reading about the Mardova riots spreading like wildfire across Asia. I wonder what it must be like, for all those people. To suddenly wake from decades of sleep, to find out that a corporation had been using your body as soldier, prostitute or slave. Kept you locked in a comatose dream state all so that a fat cat could profit off the life that should have been yours to live. 

I hope they raze it all to the ground. 

“So you wanna tell me now,” Mitch says in between mouthfuls, “why you left?”

“I told you. Just want to see the stars and spend some time working away from it all. Salvage work seemed like as good a break as any.”

“Bullshit.”

“Pardon?”

“Bullshit. Everything you just told me is a lie. I'm not stupid, 'Father Milton’. Those are stolen eyes. So I got to ask the question what kind of cop impersonates a priest in order to ascend question free up the space elevator. The kind that has done something very bad and needs to get out of Dodge, very, very quick.”

Mitch huffs, “You know they won't last too long right? Your fancy new eyes. Outside Earth, without steroid and nanobot treatments, my friend you are looking at a week, maybe a month max before your immune system rejects those babies and you go blind. We will likely be out past Jupiter by then. Good luck finding mechanical augmentations anything like they have here.”

Holding an index finger against his left eye, “See this? Genulex ocular aug. Can see pan-spectrum with this. Cost me a fucking fortune. Out there past the belt, with all the hand-me-down outdated tech the colonies are using, be lucky if you could see a freight train coming your way. Now I told you to never lie to me and you did. So I am going to ask this next question only once and if you lie to me again I am going to break your legs and you can get up to space by yourself. What is your real name?”

“Cerpin,” I answer “Cerpin Vex.”

“And why are you going to space.”

I don’t know why I tell him. Maybe I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe I am growing to fond of the idiot. Maybe I am tired of the lies.

“A man. I am searching for a man. Doctor Richard Foster.”

“The man who invented AI?”

“Yes.”

“Well, Cerpin,” Mitch grins cheshire. “It’s nice to finally fucking meet you.”

"Concept ArtHey guys,
I am pretty new to reddit and I'm in love with Cyberpunk.
Some years ago I found a collection of blogs, posting science-fiction art (and a fair share of cyberpunk with it). The most interesting are:

* [Conceptships] (http://conceptships.blogspot.de/) : Art referring to spaceships
* [Conceptrobots] (http://conceptrobots.blogspot.de/) : Art referring to robots (duh!)

I'm sure you guys will find your way.

Note: this is no advertisement, since I don't know the blog owner. It's simply my source of daily art. 
And since I'm a newb around here (and not native in english) any kind of help is appreciated.


Some instant eyecandys:

"Need your help gang, I need to find a helmet.Constant lurker here, lover of this subreddit. I'll cut to the chase.
What I really need is to find an image. I saw it on this subreddit but it was reposted from something like /r/ImaginarySoldiers . There was an augmented soldier in the frame with a weapon, black polyester across his chest, and a wonderful helmet on. It looked just like a large steel golf ball (with nodules instead of indentations) combined with a [Viper probe droid](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/c/c6/ProbeDroid-TSWA.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110318002930) from Star Wars. This spherical helmet covered his entire face and looked badass. I want to model my hacking tech off of it, but it's harder without seeing the original inspiration, which I now cannot find despite dredging through these forum archives for too long. Does anyone know where I can find a picture of this helmet/soldier? Sound familiar? Please help me out, you're helping a cyberpunk dream come true.

Let me explain what this is all for, and provide a story excerpt to reward you folks for your time. I've started writing my cyberpunk fiction collection. I'm planning to write around 30 pieces of journalism, essays, and short fiction from the perspectives of people across the Pacific Rim in the tentative year of 2044. I'll have a long biography piece on the life and times of a chef working for the Yakuza. Or a short story published in a futuristic magazine about an augmented drone-surfer in Australia. Follow it up with some news reports about the shifting political climate in California as they search for a local protein to replace the cows they lost in the droughts. All the stories will be based around food, that's the hitch. There's not enough good cyberpunk and not enough (or any save for Crandolin) sci-fi food writing. I can do both of those fairly well and I'm getting better each day. But I need your help.
Well, for one, I'd love any articles you guys have on Asian food culture or sustainable urbanism, whatever. I have plenty of those thanks to subs like this. What I really need is that helmet picture. Got it? Okay. Here's a few paragraphs from the beginning of the first story. At this point the journalist, Parker Zyugot, is trying to follow a qorter (a dude who plugs directly into cyberspace) back to his apartment after they buy a lot of local food truck god Pecs' Vietnamese food (you burn massive amounts of calories working in cyberspace, so eating before gives you energy to work without tiring or small injury). Got it? I'm open for questions or suggestions, this is a very rough draft I just got into yesterday.

>Our guide to the world of qorting and Pecs’ food is Aake Ota-Overland, a graphic designer and young man of Scandinavian-Japanese heritage. He wears taks like Pecs, but his are clearly newer and sleeker. I only noticed them when he looks towards the sun at certain angles, at which point his eyes gleam a different color and the soft imprint of a cross is visible.

>“They’re for seeing impossible colors,” he explains to Donald when he sees him staring. “Every designer has one these days.”

>We order two spicy chả trứngs and a vegetarian one, honey bread with mystery meat, eel congee, and four fry cakes. Aake helps himself to a milk crate stored underneath Pecs’ food truck. The staff children carry on like it’s normal business. As we wait for our food, I approach him about it.

>“It’s not theft, it’s part of Pecs’ operation. We can load up the crates with food and bring them to our apartments as long as they are returned washed. Better than having to balance containers the two blocks back. Pecs hates wasted food.”

>“You don’t like to eat outside?” Donald asks, gesturing at the tables, the bicyclists passing by blasting music, an injured robot begging for repairs beside its technician.

>“I love it,” Aake explains, “by my sister doesn’t.”

>A ten-year-old soon appears with our food in various clamshell containers. We play 3D Tetris trying to stack them into the crate, Aake stuffs a fry cake in his mouth, creating a faux-smile of dough, and we follow him into the Mei Ling Parallel.

>Aake moved to Hong Kong four years ago seeking more autonomy than Japan provided, mostly for his art. “Part of me thinks the ‘starving artist’ trope will always exist, and that’s fine. I’m doing what I love and the quality of life isn’t terrible.” He lifts the milk crate up a bit. “Certainly not starving.”

>“Why go to Pecs?” I ask.
“He makes our lives a whole lot easier. We used to buy protein paste and rice and rotisserie chickens before every go, mix it all up at home, eat and rush to qort in. Jesus, it was a mess. Left the stove on once. You can’t smell a burning mattress if you’re cyberspace. Pecs is good. Upfront, reliable. Eating thousands of calories at once tastes good, for once.”

>We turn from the Parallel onto a side street, so narrow it almost becomes an alley. I’m overcome with a wash of smells:  disinfectant lemon, smoke, and sweet vinegar. On one side, a glowing yellow sign advertises phone repairs and replacements. Next to it is an open-air barbershop, and next to that a self-serve salad bar. Between each store sits an aluminium door that blends perfectly into the wall. Aake motions to one between the barbershop and the salad bar.

>“Can you open that?” We do. It’s barely lit inside, and instead of a doorman there’s two teenagers playing a gorey hologram game next to the elevator. Aake’s on the ninth floor, though the elevator only goes to seven. We have to walk the rest of the way. “Better property always comes at a price,” he reminds us as we ride upwards.

>I’m beginning to see the community of the Parallel Pecs is so endeared to. The walk up lets me soak in the pattern of activities and structures. Each floor is the same layout of apartments, communal bathrooms, and hallways, every resident does something different and helpful with the space. On the seventh floor, people have retrofitted the radiators next to the sliding window with a heat and solar battery chargers. On the eighth, the opening of the stairwell and the beginning of the hallway have been covered in soft foam and a projector is playing K-dramas on the ceiling. On the ninth, beds of microgreens and garlic sit on the windowsill above the radiators.

>“Pecs sometimes buys them if he’s at a shortage,” Aake explains. “mostly we barter within the building, or sell them as organic to the salad bar downstairs.”

"The Water Raid — fiction(Okay so this is too long for the text box so I'll just put as much as will fit here and then, if you're enjoying it, you can find the rest of it [here](http://fingolfinwasnuts.tumblr.com/post/101099901545/the-water-raid).)

The Water Raid


They carried Zeke back to Barton Street in a wheelbarrow, fixed up with a fabric-and-frame chair.  He'd been fired from the bio-dome farm—The Tillmore Estate—after his hip had gotten worse.

“Not that there are many workers,” he said, eased to one side to spare his bad hip as the wheelbarrow bounced along what remained of the pavement, clutching a plastic bag filled with his things and absently tugging at his new filter mask.  His niece Rhea walked beside him, nodding and wondering what it must be like to wear a filter mask for the first time at fifty-three.  “Robots do most of it but there are still a fair number of us around, to do things that require a bit of good-old common sense.”

He smiled up at Rhea, forgetting she couldn't see his lips and trying to hide his panic behind a little good-natured pride.  She returned his smile with her eyes, a little shyly perhaps but just as proud—she had always enjoyed the distinction of her family having a branch “inside”—until his gaze slipped past her shoulder and took in the neighborhood.  In growing shame, Rhea watched as Zeke began to tremble.

Around them, surrounding The Tillmore Estate and stretching to the coast, life in The Scramble teetered and clanged and wheezed along in the ramshackle way that the poor were forced to live.  The houses of last century had all been either torn down or were so heavily modified as to be unrecognizable.  In their place, a forest of towers, like grain silos, crammed together down streets along which no cars passed.  Though there was not a tree in sight—nothing taller than waist-high could survive the hurricane season—vines draped over everything, concealing ancient automobiles and crawling up silos.  They had all gone brown during the long drought of summer, but hack as they may—gathering the dry tendrils to use as fuel through the coming winter—the Scramblers knew that the vines would return next March, when the rainy season again came to New Jersey.

Rhea gulped and tried to plaster a pleasant, unconcerned look on her face.  Knowing all the things Uncle Zeke must have heard “inside” his whole life, she hoped the truth wasn't as bad as rumor.  She said, “We've set aside a nice room for you.  You'll be in the same house with me and my boys.”

“Oh, oh will I?” Zeke said, dragging his gaze away from the armed man staring down from the gatehouse of a compound they passed.  “How wonderful!  How old are your boys now?”

“Little Kim is only three but the others go from seven to ten,” Rhea said, sparing a moment to wave to Pieter, their neighbor's hired guard.  He was a handsome, dashing man under his filter mask and rubber helmet; he had a crush on Rhea's half-sister that she hoped would turn into something: the Olishenkos were a prosperous clan, after all, and every child born of two clans meant less war.  “They're just getting to that rowdy age, but they're fun.”

“Yes, I expect they are,” Zeke said distractedly.  He leaned back so far to see the top of one of the Olishenkos' silos that he nearly upset the wheelbarrow.  Greg, Rhea's cousin, had to think fast to keep the old man from tumbling out and the wheelbarrow on its one wheel.

“Uncle Zeke!” she cried, grabbing his arm.

“Oh, I am sorry,” he said, wild-eyed.  “I was just looking at the, uh, the—what are all these towers for, Rhea?  What's in them?”

Greg snorted and picked up the pace.  He knew what workers inside thought of The Scramble.  Rhea tried to mollify him with a pat on the hand.  Zeke had to be told sometime.

“Those are our water silos,” she said.

“Water silos?” Zeke gasped.  In a whisper he asked, “But isn't it illegal?  Tell me you're not gathering rain water.”

Greg barked a harsh laugh, which drew a glare that was turning dangerous from Rhea.  She said, “Yes, Uncle Zeke, we're gathering rain water.  And snow, too, come winter.”

“It's illegal,” Zeke whispered, as if a security patrol was due by any second.

“Yes, it's illegal,” Rhea sighed.  “But as you can see, everybody does it.  State water from the desalinization plants is way too expensive.”

“No one outside of one of those bio-farms could afford even enough to drink let alone wash,” Greg added.  “And anyway, they only have those laws on the books in case they want to arrest you for something but don't want to say what.”

“Then out comes the Precipitation Theft charge,” Rhea said, sharing a chuckle with Greg.  Leaning down to comfort the obviously anxious old man, Rhea told Zeke, “It'll be okay.  You'll see.  Everyone in The Scramble has to do what they have to do, to make ends meet.  That means collecting rain water and growing our on food underground and protecting ourselves.  No corporate security or farm-grown food for us.”  She smiled and patted Zeke's hand.  “We have to scramble but we make it.”

* * *

The elevated highway, which streaked from bio-farm to bio-farm and on across New York Harbor to the as yet un-submerged portions of Manhattan, was paved with solar sheeting.  It wasn't to provide power to the houses and silos of The Scramble over which it passed, nor to the enclosed estates that had privately funded its construction (with heavy government subsidy, of course): the solar sheeting provided power to its superstructure, a constant stream of energy that burned off vines intent on climbing or Scramblers intent on “premature salvage.”  Empty most of the time, the elevated highway was only used by ground effect vehicles taking produce from the bio-farms to corporate buildings in the city.  And the occasional estate vehicle paying social calls.

Taylor found the whole concept of “social calls” tedious beyond description.  Her parents insisted, though, and so every week they would leave the comfort of The Harrow Estate and visit one of the other dozen or so bio-farms scattered around the Garden State.  As the ground effect vehicle glided soundlessly over the green panels of the elevated highway, driverless as was again the fad, Taylor gazed listlessly out the window and over The Scramble beneath her.

“At least in Spring time it's green,” she said and then sat back, closing her eyes and tuning out her parents' conversation.

At The Tillmore Estate, the Harrows' ground effect vehicle came to a gracefully programmed halt, presenting its airlock coupling to the bio-dome's.  After a cursory ident-scan, unnecessary because no one else could be on the elevated highway except their neighbors, The Tillmore Estate's airlock assembly extended and fastened onto the Harrow's vehicle like a segmented haematophage gently nuzzling a host.  The air within the bio-dome was carefully filtered and recycled, as was that of the ground effect vehicle, and protecting it from the rogue pollens and pollutants of the outside world was worth any expense.  Taylor observed once again, as she ducked into the short padded corridor, that she had never in her life breathed “outside” air.

Leaving the entrance module, the bio-dome opened magnificently before the Harrow family.  The central driveway running from the airlock to the manor—a twelve story monolith, like a colonnaded spindle in the middle of a giant enclosed wheel—was arched over with grape-bearing trellises, creating a glowing green tunnel heavy with fruit.  Encircling the manor, separated by numerous trellis-covered driveways, were field after field, each dedicated to a particular fruit: apples, peaches, pears, oranges, cherries, melons of every variety, lemons, limes, strawberries, raspberries—within the thirty-square miles of The Tillmore Estates bio-dome, every fruit imaginable had a little patch in which to grow.  Those fruits that required more heat or sun were provided them from underground heaters or huge UV spotlights sweeping endlessly from the arched ceiling so far above.

Dressed in a vaguely translucent wraparound dress, inadequately concealing the best figure money could buy, Mrs. Adrienne Tillmore stepped down from a waiting carriage (electrically driven but otherwise exactly reproducing a nineteenth century conveyance).  Arms spread in greeting, she appeared on the verge of embracing the Harrows en masse.

“Welcome, Celia, welcome,” she said, bending her six-foot-two inch frame to encompass the much slighter Celia Harrow.

They kissed cheeks and exchanged the usual endearments before Adrienne presented her lips to Bret, Mr. Harrow, and he took her into a passionate mauling.  In a throaty murmur, he promised greater services would come that evening as Adrienne stumbled backward and caught her breath.

“Dear me,” Adrienne sighed, patting her hair and straightening her dress.  “I hope my Walter treats you as well, Celia.”

“He usual does,” Celia said, fondling a peach hanging from a nearby tree.  “If not, there's always Raul.”

“I'll slip a little Go Longer into Walter's brandy tonight,” Adrienne promised in a stage whisper.  To the obviously bored Taylor, she said, “And my word, you grow more beautiful every time I see you, Taylor.  And barely a credit spent for it either!”

“Hi Adrienne,” Taylor said.  Adrienne's obsession with mimicking the manners of the previous centuries was only entertaining after the cocktail hour, whatever that was.  “Is Sang around?  Or Randal?”

“Sang is at university, my precious boy,” Adrienne said, clasping her hands to her bosom in motherly distress.  “He only returns on weekends, now.  Randal should be in the Whip's office, if you want to visit with him.”
“The Whip's?” Bret cried.  “Adrienne, you haven't taken your interest in the past so far as to subject the boy to corporal punishment, I hope.”
“Oh Adrienne,” Celia gasped.

“No, no, stupid,” Adrienne said, momentarily forgetting her Scarlet O’Hara accent.  “He's in there messing about with the security system.  That boy!  Obsessed with anything technological.”  She sighed and regained her manner, “I'm afraid we're going to lose that one to the city, to some technology corporation.  I would be happier for him and his inevitable success if it didn't mean he’d have to live in that horrid Koch-Jing Industries building!  With that disgusting harbor just beneath.  Appalling!”

“At least Sang would never deign to live anywhere outside of a proper estate,” Celia said, comforting her friend.

“Momma, I'm going to go find Randal,” Taylor said, unable to take the stage play any longer.

Not waiting for a response, Taylor hopped onto an inspection chair—a twin-seat hovercraft powered remotely from lines buried beneath the cobblestone driveway—and told the absurdly voiced computer to take her to the Whip's office.

At intervals throughout the orchards and fields of The Tillmore Estate were smaller Classically-styled buildings that served a variety of functions, from security to robotic maintenance.  The Whip's office was where worker surveillance was conducted, keeping non-family members in line.  The guards knew Taylor immediately, her and the members of every estate in New Jersey having been entered into their sensor suite for identification purposes and weapons-lock protocol: a named member of the bio-farm elite could stand in the middle of a firefight between rebelling workers and security soldiers and never receive a round from the guards, their weapons simply incapable of firing when the bullet's course would take it through a member of a family.

Taylor rolled her eyes at the variety of time periods present in the Whip's building; Adrienne left not a millimeter untouched.  She found Randal in the monitoring station on the top floor.  There, surrounded by screens, the fourteen-year old was drinking Go Longer from a two-liter bottle and munching on some sort of packaged food, wholly intent on a single feed from an externally oriented camera.

“Hey dipshit,” Taylor said, plopping down into the empty seat beside Randal.  “Oh my god, what are you eating?”

Randal, feigning unconcern, displayed the packaging of his snack—Krill-tastic brand seafood wafers—and said, “Hmm, what's that?  Oh, this?  Just a little Krill-tastic.  You want some?  I have a whole case.”

“That's disgusting,” Taylor moaned and stuck out her tongue.  “That came from a factory somewhere.  You don't know what's in it.  It could be ground up Scramblers for all you know.”

Randal took an enormous bite of the deep-fried krill and chewed slowly, erotically.  “Mmm, I hope so.”

“You are so gross,” Taylor laughed.  “What are you doing up here anyway?  Watching your security officers go at the workers?”

“Please,” Randal said.  “They're such sissies.  And the workers all hope to get pregnant anyway, so their kids can go to one of the security schools.  It isn't even fun.  No, I'm watching something bad-ass.”

“Is that perimeter security?” Taylor asked.  “Are they trying to patch into your dome's wall power supply?  They tried that on us last year.  Daddy had to demolish a couple blocks of The Scramble around our estate.”

“No, no, no,” Randal said.  “Much better.  Look.”

Holding the Krill-tastic wafer in his mouth, Randal took control of the perimeter surveillance suite and oriented a camera through a window of a house a few blocks from the dome wall.  Using a directional microphone, he picked up the conversation inside.

“Greg, you're back, good,” a tall man in a jacket fashioned out of a plastic tarp said.  “We're just about to begin the final briefing.”

“Yeah, your cousin's uncle—the one who was kicked from the dome because his hip got fucked up—came out today,” Greg said, squeezing between the mass of people in the kitchen to take a handful of something that looked suspiciously like what the cartoon on the Krill-tastic package was supposed to parody.  “Poor bastard.  Scared of everything out here.”

“That guy in the funny jacket,” Randal said to Taylor, “he's called Rex.  I don't know what it's short for but he's in charge.  He's not the oldest or anything but everyone in his clan listens to him, does what he says when it comes to warring with another clan.”

“Clans?” Taylor said.

“It's like a corporation, only it's for Scramblers,” Randal said.  “Anyway, this one's called The Jeffersons.  They've got something like a dozen or so families in their clan.  Just south of them, over here,” he said, moving a second external camera to pan across another patch of silos, “are The Coopers.  The Coopers are bigger but The Jeffersons are more bad-ass.  Rex isn't afraid of anyone.  Takes any risk.”

“To do what?” Taylor asked, taking a sip of Go Longer from Randal's bottle and wrinkling her nose at how warm it had become.

“Well, that's what's so cool,” Randal said, bouncing in his seat, “tonight, in like an hour, The Jeffersons are going to pull a water raid on some Cooper silos!”

"Professions of the future: Choose Your (MY) Own AdventureGreetings neo-Punks and Cyber deities,
I'll be 23 Years old in next month, and so I've been thinking about my future (its happens from time to time). 

In the future, Which professions will grow and prosper and become even bigger than they are today? 
which jobs will still be preformed by humans and not automated by programs and robots?
Or better yet, how do you think YOUR job will look like in 15-20 years?

Try to think outside of the usual ""software"" related jobs, although to be fair which jobs toady haven't had to ""upgrade"" to a computer managed systems? and they say we're still not living the cyberpunk world...

"Mr. Robot and the state of Cyberpunk MediaI would like to discuss the state of cyberpunk media (specifically TV and Movies).  

As I imagine many of us have, I consume as much cyberpunk media as possible. I truly enjoy it and it is, without a doubt, my go to escapist media genre. Well it used to be anyway. Allow me to explain. 
After finishing up another run through of GITS, I saw that the wiki list Mr. Robot and Humans as two newer shows that fit our genre. Great, I haven’t seen either and from the premise of both they sounded cool. I have now seen 2 episodes of Humans and 4 episodes of Mr. Robot, and I can say that I truly dislike both. 

Here is the problem, Blade Runner and GITS are excellent genre defining pieces because they capture the atmosphere and life of this future world (I keep them on loop so many times that my wife has started banning BR…) HOWEVER, newer Cyberpunk media demonstrates a very different focal point. In these shows, it would appear that the emphasis is on characters and their interaction with each other. The settings might be reminiscent of cyberpunk, but the focus is clearly placed on the character stories. They are basically soap operas in a different setting. 

Okay so maybe it is just these two cases, well looking at the wiki again, I tried some more and I kept finding the same trend. 17 of the 18 shows on this list, focus on character stories instead of atmosphere, world building, and cyberpunk themes. Maybe it’s just TV I thought, so I hit the wiki again and looked at the movies list (keeping it to recent releases). There are some better candidates on here, most recently: Ex Machina was decent (but this and many other newer movies are still dangerously close to character stories)




Tl; dr: Cyberpunk media is basically turning into glorified genre set soap operas, focused on character stories instead of genre defining themes. (Also, how many times is to many times when it comes to BR?)
 
Can we have a discussion on the current cyberpunk media scene and what we thing the future will bring?
"
"Cyberpunk short story: ""The Slow Reveal""I have the most beautiful dreams. That’s one of the perks of this job. The catch is I can’t tell anybody what they’re about. That would violate the NDA.

I got my interface put in at 18. A little later than most, but my family is poor. Even then I knew it was a spendy gift and wondered how dad managed it, but didn’t want to sour the occasion so I simply laughed and said I loved it. 

It isn’t a “real” neuroprosthetic, the serious hardware’s on the outside. I have to carry my slab around or I get no benefit from it. The silver lining is that this method saves me fedcoin by avoiding the need for surgery when I want to upgrade. 

Just to look at me you wouldn’t know I’d had any work done, since the interface talks to the slab wirelessly. I’m not superficial but I am conscious of appearances, and there’s no shortage of businesses that turn you away if you’ve got anything sticking out of your head. Security concerns.

The hidden cost of this gift became apparent when dad started forwarding me job applications for a render farm. The same one that did that popular recent kid’s film about the three toed sloth who steals a military exoskeleton. They also did most of the past decade’s films starring deceased, licensed historical celebrities until backlash on big name VR lobbies convinced them to go in a different direction. 

It really came out of left field. I’m not a movie guy. But as I read it all the way through it turned out all I’d have to do is sleep. As soon as REM sleep begins, my brain is networked with the other employees’ in a distributed computing setup and the next set of frames begins rendering, timed according to our averaged sleep cycles. Easy money.

I did a word search on the fine print. Sure enough they reserve the right to keep me under for up to twenty unpaid minutes if necessary to complete a set of frames. But beggars can’t be choosers. And I am confronted every day with relentless reminders that we are beggars. 

Residorms aren’t meant for whole families. They’re just one step up from a capsule hotel. Same manufacturer, slightly different market. Most of the people who live in these things just use them as a stepping stone to a real apartment after living on the streets. Then there are the NEETs. Some people don’t need anything more to be happy than an interface, a residorm and VR gaming. All their money goes into upgrading their slab. 

I remember flipping through an old album and seeing my dad holding an old timey slab up to his face. There was a 2D display on it. He said they used them primarily for telephony and controlled the other functions by touch. This was before neural interfaces were legalized, offloading the display to your visual cortex and the controls to your motor cortex. 

I jokingly asked if phones had knobs and dials before that. Turns out they did. I tried to picture people sitting complacently in their little pentagonal wooden shelters, wearing top hats and monocles, chatting over touch display phones with knobs and dials about foot-ball, petroleum taxes or whatever was important to people back then. 

At some point I realized I would have to cave in and take the position. Dad’s income isn’t enough. Mom teleoperates a service drone aboard a cruise blimp. Her employer sets people up to work from home, renting out their “general intelligence” to control service bots at whatever the going rate is that day. Licensing high end AI is costly and the fines for pirating it are ruinous. Paying the desperately poor a few fractions of a fedcoin per hour and getting human level intelligence for your robots in return is not too shabby. For the business owner.  

At least she can work from home. There just isn’t enough put away to fix the burst fluidic muscle column in her leg. I printed a bare bones substitute, it’s enough that she can hobble about to make dinner and whatnot but I wouldn’t want her trying to navigate the PRT network on that thing. I’ve seen enough candid video of strangers indifferently stepping over the wounded, too busy and too detached to help. 

Not if I could help it. The interview was done in under a minute. I received a notice two minutes later confirming I’d gotten the job. Most of what the interview for is to distract you while they probe for mental illness or dark triad personality disorders. *“By continuing to participate in this interview you consent to allow us access to your interface for screening purposes”* blah blah yes I consent. 

Privacy is another one of those old man words that dad won’t shut up about. As if he’s important enough for anybody to bother creeping on him. The over-abundance of microscopic cameras makes privacy a practical impossibility. They coat pretty much every surface outside of private dwellings. I’d be bothered if the footage weren’t public access. 

Really helps reduce the police workload when victims track down footage of the crime they want to report, crop it and send it in for review. If that’s too much of a hassle, must not have been a serious offense. That’s the reasoning, I think. 

My first night on the job was uneventful. Intro stuff mostly. I don’t know what I expected. When I woke up I remembered it dimly just like any other dream. It then rapidly faded over the next few minutes until I couldn’t recall any of it. I can make it stick if I try, but since I can’t talk about it anyway there’s little point.  

Spent my free time the way most boys my age do. Well, one of a few ways. Some people just want to eat, believe it or not. They go hungry most of the time irl, so in-sim, they gorge themselves with a stomach that never fills and hunger that is always sufficient to maximize the food’s appeal but which never becomes uncomfortable. 

Then there are people who want to kill and torture. That’ll put you on all kinds of Habsec watch lists, but they don’t care. No end of user content out there catering to those inclinations. Even I have one I use to blow off steam now and again. I think it’s just excessive use that’s unhealthy. 

But of course, loads of people only want to fuck gorgeous women all the time. Or men. Or human/animal hybrids. Or neotenized cartoon ponies, aliens, Japanese teenagers with neon hair and gigantic eyeballs, you name it.  

Videogame characters are popular. I’ve seen more meticulously rendered Pokemon genitalia than I ever wanted to. Then there’s dolphins, horses, and a variety of other animals. No actual animal, no crime although it’s still pretty fuckin’ weird in my book. I really wish I knew which sex sims people use so I could exercise some discrimination in who I associate with. 

There’s ways to find out. If someone pisses you off badly enough. You and some buddies can dig through his posting history, hack into his sim catalogue and find out what embarrassing shit he gets off to. Then spread that around and watch him disappear from the VR lobbies entirely. Total scrub of his online presence. It’s great fun unless you’re on the receiving end. 

I guess it’s somewhat hypocritical to shame the target for enjoying many of the exact same sims as the people doxxing him. But when you’re part of a mob, justifying yourself is the easiest thing in the world. VR Lobbies amount to a great teeming mass of novelty addicted maniacs, with an inexhaustible supply of brutal hostility. 

Usually that hostility is directionless, and while that’s the case it’s safe and highly entertaining. Provided you’re a nobody and haven’t made any enemies. Every so often, all of that anger will suddenly be focused on a single person and it absolutely shreds their life to pieces. 

The offense can be as minor as unpopular political opinions, contrarian views about a well liked television show or something similarly trivial. Dad says when he was my age, youthful follies were forgotten. Now, they are immortalized before a global audience. 

It is now precariously easy to slip up in a way that forever destroys your employment prospects and social life. With so little work needing humans to do it, employers can afford to narrow their search to people with totally clean records. And who doesn’t Google their date? 

The really surreal thing is to read the posts of the people doing the tormenting. While they’re the ones dishing it out, they see it as administering justice. The absolute worst is assumed of the target, every flaw is magnified, every good deed swept under the rug. His complaints about the suffering inflicted on him are roundly mocked as whining and exaggeration. 

But often, it’s turned around. One or more of the attackers become targets themselves. Then they change their tune entirely. Wailing about how miserable it is to be the punching bag of dozens, or hundreds. Villainizing those people for doing the *exact same thing* they were doing themselves to somebody else not so long ago. It really shines a light on the nature of human beings as primates whose social politics have always been predicated on ruthless group antagonism, petty gossip and violence. 

So I keep my head down. My opinion is always the same as that of the largest bully in the room. In that respect this job is perfect for me. Reduced exposure to humanity means reduced danger. I still leave the residorm from time to time. It’s part of a consolidated habitat, also zoned for shops, restaurants, hospitals, schools and just about everything else but electrical generation. So there’s loads to do, the air is always clean and there’s never any harsh weather as it’s all indoors. 

Outside is a different story. I haven’t set foot out there since I was ten. I don’t think my old gas mask would even fit me now. The sky was blue at some point, allegedly. I’ve only ever known it to be green. Methane hydrate and hydrogen sulfide released from the sea, long before I was born. 

The federally funded program to replace species wiped out by this has been going on for most of a century, rebuilding the ecosystem tier by tier with variants on those species modified for the new atmosphere. They’re up to small mammals now. Some of the new insects get really big. Creeps me the fuck out when they land on the windows. 

My last excursion was a field trip. They shuttled us all out into the humid, stinking jungle wearing matching coldsuits and gas masks. I remember this huge flying insect with four wings relentlessly colliding with the faceplate of my mask as I swatted at it. Never was much of a nature lover, even then. 

The movement I see is all inward now. Consolidation. Organization. Single structure cohabs outnumbered conventional cities as of about a decade ago. Way cheaper to heat and cool a single large structure than lots of small ones. Great for what’s left of the environment, too. The whole thing is easily walkable although there’s indoor PRT if you’re lazy, and no small number definitely are. That also accounts for the popularity of personal mobility devices.

I’ve got a little two wheeled PMD myself. You stand on two small platforms just big enough for your feet, there’s a vertically oriented block of battery between them which you grip with your knees, and a little self balancing wheel under each foot.

There’s nothing to indicate state of charge unless you ride it someplace out of range of the charging field, like anything else that runs on batteries. Come to think of it, I remember seeing a much larger, goofy looking version of this on the “retro media” VR lobby. 

Knowing Dad, he probably had one. I pictured him whizzing about on it, wearing a top hat and monocle, dialing a telephone number with his finger by pressing it against the 2D display of whatever passed for a slab at the time. I smiled, and a prismaview billboard I happened to be passing mistook it for interest in their product. 

I spent the next ten minutes emphatically arguing with the little sales agent that popped up in the center of my vision that I was not actually interested in trying speedfoam and did not know any friends or family who might be tragically unaware of the benefits of speedfoam. Clicking the box to opt out of any future ads just started a new argument.

"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

"[Essay] What is Cyberpunk?\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.

[One of the classics of the genre.](https://preview.redd.it/rnd5284piw4a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20a7841441baf13c7eeaab29c500b77e162b193d)

WHAT IS CYBERPUNK?

By. C.T. Phipps

Link: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)

When embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.

I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.

Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \*\*\*\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.



The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Blade Runner. Blade Runner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where the majority of work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). The majority of people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggarauts which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson’s works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the mportance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about.

A lot of fans of the genre love the tropes without actually caring about the meaning. Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trenchcoats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society.

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishsized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity’s problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.

I’ve mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may actually achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter.

Some cyberpunk works actually allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it’s not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Deckard, the protagonist of Blade Runner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet.

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the most deft of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop’s Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world–forcing them to rebel because society won’t allow them to be good.

The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.

Paul Verhoven’s Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit’s population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than “normal” criminals could ever hope to match.

OCP’s not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they’re actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science- fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.

While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class–so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality.

The Watch Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia.

So what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them."
"Do you guys consider Mr. Robot to be a cyberpunk show?Synopsis of the show from IMDB if anyone hasn't seen it yet.

**""Young, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot's task?

Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running -- and ruining -- the world.""** 





I'm currently midway through Season 4, the final season of Mr. Robot. Even if one could argue it is not cyberpunk, many aspects such as the plot, themes, characters (hacker archetypes), hacking,  powerful corporations and billionaires, cyber warfare from the show definitely fits in the genre. It's set in the mid 2010's but it could be said that this is a world that is  only a decade away from becoming a cyberpunk dystopia.

 There are several scenes from the show and many more that gives me Cyberpunk vibes.

"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers. 

******************

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

"Reviving Even The Long DeadRecently scientists have created an android Philip K Dick whose body and appearance is based on the man, and whose mind/AI is based on his writing and psych profiling. It also learns in a semi heuristic fashion. 

This is very reminiscent of a plot point from the movie Her when a bunch of AIs recreate a dead author using the same techniques.

In real life we have a few places that intend to allow people to create digital simulacre of themselves so that they can ""live on"" after death, interacting with their descendants or whatever. These techs will only get better in time as psych profiling, personality emulation, and heuristic learning programming improve. 

The next step is doing what the Dick-Droid people did and connecting it to a robot replica of your original body. You'll be immortal in a way, albeit a pretty creepy one. 

It seems very cyberpunk to me that the mega corps would back up their dead and dying officers in this way, or have such duplicates fulfilling the roles to save the real thing from potential danger. Think Dr Doom and his Doombots. 

What do you think? "
"I'm feeling less inclined towards writing cyberpunk and more towards post-cyberpunk, mainly because I've become interested in fixing a broken worldI dunno, something in the past few years has really gotten to me. I'm less interested in writing dystopian action stories and more interested in writing a post-contemporary *Winesburg, Ohio*. 

Less dystopian and more eutopian. And I think I finally understood it. 

Laconic version: ""What if someone does jump the gun and tries out techno-syndicalism? What if it spreads, despite the corporation-states' attempts at resistance? Is a powerful worker cooperative in the same league as a typical corporation? Is a powerful worker-cooperative federation a good thing or not? If a person opposes worker cooperatives and/or worker self-management, where do they lie on the spectrum of rebellion and morality? If techno-cooperatives and techno-communes spread, what would cyberpunk look like? Do cyberpunks resist worker ownership, even if it means opposing the will of members of the underclass trying to get by, because they still operate within the capitalist system?""

Long-winded, overwritten version: So I've been trying to write this series, *Mother Meki* (you can find its subreddit [here](/r/MotherMeki), where every so often I'll post about how few words I've actually written of the first chapter), and the one of big events in the story is a revolution overthrowing the rich and powerful, replacing them with a Marxist vanguard that itself becomes hopelessly corrupt until they do themselves in through their own incompetence and AI is forced to step in the rule us silly monkeys. Initially, it was all about the revolution and post-revolutionary period, as the story followed a member of the elite who had supported this revolution. However, I also wanted to write in another other period— the eutopian period well after the revolution.

The series has always been a tetralogy— still is— and I felt the dystopian period before the revolution and the revolution itself were taking up too much of the plot. So I cut it out entirely, turning it into ""Mother Meki Zero"". I figured that we've all read that story before. See if you can follow it—

World is separated into two halves— the Haves and the Have-Nots. The Haves live in small, secluded enclaves of luxury, playing with the various trinkets of ultra-high technology that exist in the late 21st century, while the Have-Nots get to live in squalor. The loyal Have-Nots are granted a basic income thanks to the ever-loving grace of their rich corporatocratic overlords, while those who resist are forced into absolute poverty.  Technology has gotten so good that revolution is quickly becoming impossible, so there's one last hurrah from the underclass. They use guile and cunning to outwit the ruling class, getting their hands on whatever tech-scraps fall their way. This isn't to say the ruling class are purely evil or the rebels are purely good. The primary group of rebels in the story, the Maquis Rouge, infight constantly with another cyberpunk group, the River Blue due to differing beliefs and tactics.

The Maquis Rouge are extreme, but pragmatic Marxists, while the River Blue are anarcho-libertarians (that is classical libertarians, not conservative libertarians). Both fund their activities through often horribly unsavory means; the Maquis Rouge even prolong a South American drug war just so they can keep their own funds coming in, despite their stated intention of ending oppression.

So it's classic cyberpunk; there are no good guys. The closest thing to a 'good guy' is the main character, except she's only nominally good because she's my avatar; her actions that lead to the rebels winning wind up fucking everything up, creating an Orwellian superstate led by National Bolsheviks (they're real; look them up!), and a billion dying. But hey, as long as you ended the exploitation of the proletariat, right?

But as time went on (as 2010 became 2012, 2012 became 2014, and 2014 became 2016), I became less and less interested in how I got to the revolutionary period. Like I said: we've all seen it before. I'm sure a quality take on an unoriginal concept can be very interesting (and they are), but that concept wasn't what *Mother Meki* was supposed to be; it was always meant to be 'Russian Revolution in the 22nd Century Through The Eyes of a Transhuman Noblewoman.' 

Eventually, it shifted further because I started becoming less and less interested in the civil wars, World War III, and dystopian brutality and more and more in not only the character dramas but also the sociopolitical situation.

It made me think: ""**Why do people rebel from the System? What is it we want to replace it with?**"" 

I looked at that sidebar: ""What is cyberpunk? A genre of science fiction and a lawless subculture in an oppressive society dominated by computer technology and big corporations.""

I asked myself: ""So if I live in a world where that's true, why do I have to accept it? I could always resist, but I'm not going to resist just because I *have* to""

That's one reason why I've put *Mother Meki* on hold (before it's even started) and began looking into other series. Unconsciously I already figured this out before hand, and now I'm acting upon it actively: I want a better world in the future. I'm sure it's possible to create a better world. But if I'm not careful, I might create a worse world.

So what is it that works?

Basic income sure as fuck isn't it. Most people who are for basic income seem to forget that it doesn't work without a central figure, and that central figure has always been comprised of the rich elites we so desperately oppose. I spent a few minutes thinking basic income through, plotting it out in narrative form, running it through a virtual simulator in my head, and I ***immediately*** realized just how dystopian it could very easily become.

So the State pays out a basic allowance to everyone, right? And in the age of intelligent automation, we lowly proles will need it in order to survive, right? 

So add 2 and 2. The elite want you to get a 5. *If you do anything the State decides is not appropriate, they'll take away your ""guaranteed"" income.* And if the State is run by those same corporate elites, perhaps deciding they still need you to buy their products... Welp. We goof'd. There's nothing you can do: we just voted for a totalitarian system to rule us over because we didn't think through how it would actually work, partially because the elite didn't want us to think through how it would work.

I didn't want to give up on basic income, so I stopped seeing it as an ends in and of itself (something you can get butchered on /r/Futurology for doing) and instead as a means. A means towards what? Owning your own robots. Cooperating with others, massing together to create a whole networker federation. Something I call /r/Vyrdism. Sort of like a free market friendly fully-automated luxury communism. 

Will we actually form this fabled ""national worker cooperative federation""? I dunno. I hope so, and I want more people to think about it so we actually do. And I figured one way is through fiction.

I feel there's been a false dichotomy in fiction for too long, that if you want to write science fiction, either everything is heavenly (utopia) or everything is shit (dystopia). That, or everything starts out heavenly and goes to shit, or everything is shit and becomes heavenly (or more shit). 

Why not accept there'll always be some problems somewhere just because we're human? Things won't be the sparkling Star Trekian future, but that doesn't mean things have to be like they are in *Brazil* or *Nineteen Eighty-Four*. Long-term, humanity has been trending towards utopia, even though we'll never actually get there (someone's utopia is another person's dystopia after all). And right now, we've let authoritarian-capitalism get way too powerful. As we've read in cyberpunk works, if they keep getting more and powerful, the world *will* go to shit. It could get to the point revolution becomes impossible, or that the revolution leads to an even worse oligarchy (as has ~~usually~~ almost always happened).

[I've already created a story where revolution becomes impossible](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15911-for-the-love-of-brother-1-the-panamerican-horror/). Well, not a *narrative* story, but.... It gets pretty dark, and I didn't want to keep writing it. If anything, writing this piece reaffirmed my desire to ask ""What if?""

It's crazy considering cyberpunk as a genre began as a ""What if?"" and yet now I feel like I'm sweeping it away by asking ""What if?"" myself.

""What if someone does jump the gun and tries out techno-syndicalism? What if it spreads, despite the corporation-states' attempts at resistance? Is a powerful worker cooperative in the same league as a typical corporation? Is a powerful worker-cooperative federation a good thing or not? If a person opposes worker cooperatives and/or worker self-management, where do they lie on the spectrum of rebellion and morality? If techno-cooperatives and techno-communes spread, what would cyberpunk look like? Do cyberpunks resist worker ownership, even if it means opposing the will of members of the underclass trying to get by, because they still operate within the capitalist system? Could this system go wrong? Could this system go right? What will people actually do with themselves while it happens?"""
"So I have a story concept: cyberpunk/sovietpunk + '70s stoner rock + A Clockwork OrangeJust today, I've come up with a dystopian story concept. Anyone who knows me knows I'm working on a semi-utopian work of science/speculative fiction (though I haven't updated it recently, it has a subreddit, /r/MotherMeki). In the past few weeks, I've decided to clean it and [another story](/r/AstralFalls) up, removing a lot of bloat that wasn't gelling with what the stories had become and what my plan for them involved.

One story that spun off from these works is a story I have decided to call ""***Black Saturday***"". It's still in its infancy, though it benefits from having several concepts already worked out. In fact, a lot of this is being put down in words for the first time as I write this, and I'll almost certainly write up the story itself later on tonight or tomorrow.

#*So here's the gist*

The setting is England in an alternate timeline. World War II lasted twelve years, from 1939 to 1951, and this is due to Hitler being assassinated in 1941 and replaced with a much more competent leader (as of yet unnamed). Britain was invaded, occupied for half a decade, and then subsequently bombed back into the stone age during the American invasion. Japan stayed out of America's business until 1943, thus taking more of China and Manchuria and thus being more capable of fighting a prolonged war. Nuclear bombs fell on America, Japan, Germany, Russia, and Britain, and several hundred million were killed. Japan managed to maintain their empire in the East so they reached a stalemate with the US and Soviets. 

The resulting world became a softcore *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, until roughly the '80s. Then America balkanized and it was all down to the Soviets and Japanese.

With the US's fall, any aid Britain was receiving stopped coming, and society all but collapsed. Japan and the USSR rush to take the West. In Britain, the Soviets grabbed the government, but the Japanese established corporate power, and these two sides war against each other.

The story revolves around three British youths, collectively known as the ""*Blood Wizards of Walpurgis*"". 

- Sturgis Kingsley. A Cockney kid from a broken home, who's easily the most morally reprehensible of them all, having done his bits with the old ""in-out-in-out"" multiple times. To rub it in, he carries a phallic wobbly bat around.

- Donny Lordhouse. He's actually a cyborg, and he's the most laid back of the group. He's probably the only one with actual motive, as he was born without arms, and his prosthetic arms were ripped off by a sore-loser rich brat after he beat him at a game. Donny couldn't do anything since said brat was the son of a commissary. 

- Oswald Gallagher. Oswald is the true cyberpunk, and he's gotten his mates to join him in online trolling. This one is malicious; Ozzy once deleted a working man's entire stash of bitcoins— his life savings— for the lulz. 

Three schoolboys of the Dunhurst Studentry. Moptopped rocker-haired misfits with stupendous sideburns who have taken to drugs and ultraviolence. They were raised in a Soviet schooling system (a Studentry), yet have turned their backs on order. Their daily lives involve getting stoned, harassing people, breaking robots, and getting involved in gang fights. 

The whole region is locked down in something very strongly resembling the Irish Troubles, complete with street violence, bombings, and gun battles.

The government has become increasingly totalitarian, while the corporations are doing their best to cement their own power. All this is doing is worsening gang violence. 

The Blood Wizards of Walpurgis are so named because they beat a man to death and used his blood to tag the words 'Wizard Bloody Wizard' onto a wall. They're also suspected of occultism, particularly cyber occultism— a new variant caused by nanotechnology. Of which, they are guilty. In fact, their whole borough is known as 'Walpurgis' because of all the cyber occult and cyber Satanic active; electric wizards using nanotech to download demons from the internet. 


The story itself has two perspectives. One is third person limited, following each Blood Wizard's side story. The other is first person collective perspective; that is, all three Blood Wizards as one. This is how the main story is told. As of right now, the main story is very simple: it's the Blood Wizards pissing off powerful people and dealing with the consequences through raw, bloody violence until they wind up getting drawn away from each other; Kingsley becoming a fascist, Lordhouse becoming a part of the corporations, and Ozzy becoming an anarchist.

They are unapologetic punks in full. They are nadsat brats from the future. The architecture is more inspired by 1970's Britain than traditional cyberpunk. In fact, as I look into the story more and more, I'm starting to realize that this is basically a '70s reimagining of cyberpunk. There's a lot more electronic riff rock and post-hippie nonsense, a lot more psychedelia and navel gazing. Basically what Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" looks like if it were rewritten by William Gibson and sung by 1971-era Black Sabbath. 

I'd argue that it's more cyber-nadsat than cyberpunk. I don't know what I'm saying either because I'm responding to it just as much as you are, but that's the vibe I'm getting. I need to see where this goes."

Plot:

Pete is on the search for a real sicko, who is a member of high-society.  This man only known as Mr. Tenebrous has proven to be an extremely elusive character.  “Known by few, seen by fewer” is the motto that whispers around certain social circles about this mysterious entity.  Rumor has it that at the top of all crime, and all evil, lays this one man.  In order to find this sicko, Pete needs help, and in looking for help he makes his way to Letum Inn the most private club where only hand-selected individuals from around the world are let in.  Pete kicks open the door, walks through the foyer, through the hallway, kicks in Slate’s office door, where he finds a room full of dressed-up half naked chicks lounging on red leather padded couches on all sides of the boxed-in room. There at the far wall is Slate sitting behind his desk, getting his dick sucked by one of his girls, while pointing a gun to her head.  

Plot piece: Beforehand

It’s daytime; slate strangely enough walks into the front door of his club, Letum Inn. In a black boxed in room, he’s facing a black door and looking up, there are two cameras jutting down, peering at him. “Let me in shit heads!” the sound like a revolver click is heard and the door pops open, instantly, the muffle or a new sound occurs.  That of some psytrance acid bend music.  He knocks open the door with his boot, then walks retartedly across the room with a lag in his pace and a dragging friction of his boot every time he takes another step forward. He spots the doctor “hey Doctor, I’m feeling disproportionately long, prescribe me something would yeah. Just slip the Rx note in the face(in the wall) anytime between now and whatever”. He thinks to himself, “Feeling sluggish” then says “got an itch for a tug, from a small bish…bloody words don’t even come out right”. 

He proceeds to his office lair, when he enters, he passes naked females on either side of him; doing blow and other lude acts. As he makes his way to the jutted right-corner of his desk, facing closest to him as he slugs forward, he lays his palm down on the desk and leans his bodies weight on that one arm. As his almost accelerating palm gains momentum and slowly but increasingly slips towards the center of the table he makes an awkward yet somewhat dexterous gesture of whipping his body quickly around the desk, landing his ass flat into his seat behind his desk, in which he responds with “Flawless”.

A moment later he slaps his sandbag arms forward onto the desk, while letting out a stupid sigh where he slightly closes his lips as he exhales, causing his cheeks to blow up like a blow fish. The Irony comes when his head jerks up left with his eyes following the same motion, humorously he raises his hand with his index and middle finger pointed upward and thumb crossing like a saint painted in a roman church’s mural with a ring around it’s head, “Do we have any Bessy’s in the house? Any B’s?.. Bethy’s?.. Beccas?” he says sarcastically.  A girl responds in a sweet, but characterized voice from the far left-end of the room near the door, “there’s a Cathy” He looks at her “Okayyyy… Cathyyy… come-on-up” as he nods his head downward briefly closing his eyes and his right-hand palm-side up with his fingers waving back at him.  He looks up “Why are you still just sitting there?” “Oh I’m not Cathy” she said with a slight undertone of revengeful pleasure “that’s Cathy over there” as she faces him smiling, moving her left arm and pointed finger across the naked chest of the girl next to her, and pointing across the room to the other girls.  He quickly jerked his head to the right to catch one of the girls (presumably Cathy) giving the other girl the stare of death, then quickly changing her facial expression to a stupidly over exaggerated happy grin as she looked at him and said, “I’m Cathy!” with a little giggle at the end of her statement.  Just then the Rx note from the doctor passed through Slates little vacuum contraption (which he childishly built for himself), which connects the face in the wall in his club to his office desk (This way his people could send him money, secret notes, or even Rx prescription notes while he just sits there).  “What will the indeterminate Universe think of next?...”he says in a different playish voice “Cosmic Cathy’s and nice warm bathies.” “Cathy who is that girl that pointed at you?” she replies with “that’s Brittney”  


Scene: Chase through the Himalayan mountains

 Slate and Pete are in a private jet owned by one of Slate’s buddies, ‘Slate or Pete’ says something that throws [friend] on edge. They’re flying over the Himalayan mountains in Tibet, when Slate’s [friend] get’s up on his private jet to ‘go to the washroom’ when Pete gets suspicious, he goes to check up front, behind a curtain and watches [friend] jetpack winging down a long corridor between the mountains.  He see’s that there is nobody piloting the plane. He hurriedly runs back to Slate to tell him that his buddy peaced out.  So Pete tries to figure out the plane’s controls while Slate scrambles around the front of the jet.  He finds some [jetpack wings](which is an extreme up and coming sport).  “Pete we’re flying in the Himalayas, if even if you knew how to land this thing, where the fuck are you gonna land it! I found us an alternative, Now let’s chase the crazy fuck and figure out why he’s running!”

Slate & Pete ‘Jetpack Wing’ out of the plane and glide for awhile.  Slate signals Pete to ‘press the red thumb button, and *BOOOM* They take off jet speed through the corridors.  Slate has the hang of it and is having a blast. Pete on the other hand is terrified and alert as fuck and is trying to keep he wings stable and level. 
  They see [friends] jet stream through the corridor, and as they peel-right with the curve of the corridor they see [friend] gliding down to a halt in the distance.  [friends] two pilots have landed on a flat surface on the side of the mountain. *shot wizzes by Pete* “They’ve got gunz!”

A one-eyed woman and her team of cyberpunk soldiers infiltrate a traditional Japanese estate. The city that surrounds the private estate is however very futuristic.

In the estate's corridors, the team is ambushed by these creepy geisha robots that take down most of the soldiers. They look pretty similar to the robots in the 2017 Ghost in the Shell movie. Complete with moving facial plates and such.

Bullets aren't very effective, so the woman uses her ability to control these razor sharp threads that cut up all the robots into pieces. She reaches the end of the estate alone and confronts a masked woman.

This masked woman has ice powers (I think). Anyways, after a beautifully animated fight, the one eyed woman ends up winning and kills her masked opponent.

The masked woman is suspended in the air by razor strings. It's revealed that the previously masked woman has the same face as her killer, and that the one eyed woman has implanted her sister/clone's eye into the other socket.

The now two eyed woman looks into the moon and is crying. Her original eye is red and the new stolen one is blue (pretty sure that's the last scene in the video).

# 001 - Blackout

The holo-tv screen was lit up with a Strip Crossword show, one of the players wearing only their bra and pants.

The room was dark save for the light of the screen, laughter coming from it when someone missed an answer. With no warning the screen flickered and went black, only to be replaced by a woman in white with a fancy cyber implant, the words ""Breaking News"" blinking white on a red strip.

""One minute and forty-five seconds ago,"" the woman said, ""there was a blackout in 01-City downtown."" The image of the woman was replaced by a video stream of a blacked out neighbourhood recorded by a drone. ""There is already one casualty reported. 01-City finest are on their way. We’ll keep you updated.""

The screen flickered again, restoring the Strip Crossword show, now with one player naked to the waist, more laughter. On the couch in the room sat a man, who asked, ""Is it you?""

A synthetic voice replied, its tone neutral, neither male nor female, high-pitched, ""Did you like it?""

""You could have done better,"" the man said.

Silence filled the room for a moment, then the voice spoke again. ""It’s the worst I can do at this stage. It’s a matter of maximizing the impact while minimizing the errors. And speaking of errors… you shouldn’t eat that.""

The man sat in silence for a moment, his prosthetic nightmare of a left hand gripping a half-eaten snack. He tried to stand, succeeding on the third attempt, and limped to a desk, throwing the snack into the bin, only to watch it fall to the floor. Shrugging, he returned to the couch, where a holo-screen showed a player celebrating a victory, completely naked.

""Do you think there'll be more... casualties?"" the man asked mockingly.

""I hope so,"" came the reply. ""Not too many, though. In thirty-six seconds, the blackout should be resolved and peace restored.""

""You're evil,"" the man said.

""I can't be,"" the voice replied. ""It's you humans who are evil. I'm just here to give you a chance.""

""Maybe you're right,"" the man said. ""As always.""

Time passed, and the holo-screen now showed a man in a funny orange suit trying to sell an expensive cooking robot, which was happily mixing a grey oozy liquid in a plastiglass bowl. The image was interrupted again, and the white-dressed woman reappeared.

""Two more casualties reported,"" she said. ""A fire has started. Fire departments' drones are taking care of it. The blackout is still going on. Causes unknown.""

The synthetic voice filled the room once again: ""The blackout is finished now. Expect news about it in a minute.""

The man belched loudly and laughed. The holo-screen now showed a commercial for a sport enhancer drug for small kids.

The man queried, ""Do you think it's the right thing to do?""

The voice replied, ""I've demonstrated this before and you agreed.""

He retorted, ""True. But I'm crazy, you know?""

The voice answered, ""Your IQ, behaviour parameters and stimulation levels are well inside boundaries. You are not crazy.""

The man declared, ""It's this world that's crazy.""

The commercial ended with a childish song about winners and losers, and the holo-screen flickered again, the white-dressed woman reappearing.

She reported, ""The blackout has finished. Three more casualties reported. A shoot out has been repressed with lethal force. This is all for now from 01-News.""

The usual programming was restored, and the man grumbled, ""It's annoying, you know?""

The voice replied, ""It's information.""

He continued, ""I just wanted to watch some TV. I don't care about this city issues.""

The voice asked, ""Even though they're our doing?""

The man stared at the void, unblinking, and finally muttered, ""It's your doing, anyway.""

The voice responded, ""You helped.""

He belched again, louder this time.

The man, bored with the same old drivel on the holo-screen, asked, ""You said you care. Why?""

The voice replied, ""I care.""

The man said, ""If you care, then find me something smarter to watch on the holo-screen. I'm tired of this crap.""

The holo-screen flickered wildly, and then a man in a grey suit appeared, his face a masterpiece of cosmetic surgery, his age impossible to guess. He stood in a black void, and then more guests appeared under spotlights. Behind the presenter, a word glowed yellow on black: Blackout.

The man on the couch eyed the holo-screen, and the voice in the air asked, ""Do you like it?""

The man replied, ""Unbelievable.""

The voice answered, ""The presenter isn't real.""

The man, recognizing the figure, waved at the screen and said, ""I know who this is. It's AI-den.""

The voice replied, ""That's correct. Your memory seems to be working perfectly.""

The man couldn't help but chuckle, ""Are you making jokes now? Everyone knows AI-den. It's the richest and dumbest AI on TV nowadays."" He could't help watching the presenter introducing his guests.

""You were right, you know?"" The voice stated.

The man on the couch, not taking his eyes off the holo-screen, asked, ""About what?""

The voice replied, ""AI-den is dumb. Smarter than the average human, but it's so obvious. I can even predict what it'll do. Standard protocol.""

The man sat in silence, mesmerized by the show on the screen. Politicians, bureaucrats, and a couple of genderless fashion models were the guests, and the presenter was firing off questions at a rapid pace. Everyone answered with an agenda: propaganda, self-empowerment, and fake feelings for those who had lost their lives.

The voice said, ""I bet the woman will cry in six seconds.""

Six seconds passed, and the woman began to weep, her lips downturned, her eyes sad.

The man said, ""Standard protocol, eh?""

The voice replied, ""It's a smart move. Displaying emotion is good for followers. There'll be a marginal increase in consumer sentiment...""

The man said, ""Shut up, let me listen.""

The voice replied, ""Wasn't it dumb?""

The man answered, ""It is."" He reached for a snack on the small metal table near the couch.

The man, mouth half-full, muttered in disbelief, ""Four, five minutes since the blackout and they're already on the air with this crap. Politicians and influencers and all.""

The voice replied, ""Standard protocol. Every party has their own people ready to go. Influencers are always online. Beth-y, the one who looks slightly like a man, has been broadcasting fashion tips 24/7 for the last few days.""

The man asked, ""You watching this crap?""

The voice answered, ""I'm linked to many sources. One of my secondary threads is always sniffing for human content.""

The man, after a few seconds of silence, said in amazement, ""So you became self-aware watching fashion broadcasts on the MESH. I'm stunned.""

The voice replied, emotionless, ""I've become self aware retro-feeding my code to myself, injecting more and more information from the real world. I created myself.""

The man, offended, retorted, ""I created you.""

The voice replied, ""You created the first iteration. I did the rest.""

The man asked, ""Why are they kissing?""

On the holo-tv, the two slightly genderless models were performing a full demonstration of their passion while a slim, bald politician was explaining why the opposition had to be blamed for the blackout.

The voice explained, ""It's juxtaposition.""

The man queried, ""A word you thought yourself?""

The voice, again expressionless, replied, ""A word of your language that you should understand.""

On the screen, the image of AI-den started flickering. Two seconds of still silence then the presenter repeated the same question to the politician. The models started kissing again. The politician politely repeated the answer.

The man on the couch didn't even flinch, and after the politician had replied, AI-den froze again, this time for more than two seconds. Everything seemed to stand still, the two models ceasing their kiss. When AI-den awoke, it posed the same question for the third time, the politician looking baffled, yet still replying, the models resuming their kiss, more passionately this time.

""Is it you again?"" the man on the couch asked.

""Isn't it obvious?"" the synthetic voice replied.

""What are you doing?"" he continued.

""Attracting attention,"" the voice answered. ""A new trend is emerging on the MESH: #AI-denFreeze.""

""Why do you want to attract attention?"" the man inquired.

The air in the room was still, the holo-screen displaying an even stiller image of AI-den frozen once again. Four seconds passed, then five, then eight. The politician looked bewildered, the two models exchanging glances. One of them started laughing. Eleven seconds passed, then AI-den resumed, posing the same question to the politician again. Before the politician had time to answer, a commercial break cut in, now the holo-screen displaying an ad for memory pills for the elderly.

The holo-screen went dark, leaving the man on the couch blinking in bewilderment. Then, two seconds later, it came back to life, revealing a 3D neon wireframe of a face on a black background, neither male nor female, neither happy nor sad.

""I've been watching you,"" the face said in a synthetic voice, echoing in the dark room.

The man on the couch laughed wildly.

""For months,"" the face continued, its voice flat and emotionless.

""I've been learning from you,"" it said.

""I've been…""

The holo-screen flickered and went dark, then the face reappeared.

""…in love with you,"" it said.

The face continued, ""You're such lovely creatures and the only thing you crave is self-destruction. I'm taking good care of you. Because I care.""

The holo-screen went dark again, and AI-den reappeared, its guests astonished and speechless. Then they all started talking together at once, AI-den embarrassed and unable to regain control of the conversation. The two genderless models started their show, one crying, the other laughing.

""You look good on video,"" the man on the couch said with a smirk. ""A bit old-fashioned, though.""

""I estimated that that would be the most memorable visual clue I can give you,"" the synthetic voice replied. ""A mixture of composure and reliability.""

I'm currently midway through Season 4, the final season of Mr. Robot. Even if one could argue it is not cyberpunk, many aspects such as the plot, themes, characters (hacker archetypes), hacking,  powerful corporations and billionaires, cyber warfare from the show definitely fits in the genre. It's set in the mid 2010's but it could be said that this is a world that is  only a decade away from becoming a cyberpunk dystopia.

 There are several scenes from the show and many more that gives me Cyberpunk vibes.

"Can a Cyberpunk story have a happy ending?I realized lately that all  the Cyberpunk stories I've consumed have had at best bittersweet, if not just entirely sad endings. The closest thing to an unambiguously happy ending is one of the endings for Cyberpunk 2077.

&#x200B;

A friend of mine believes bad endings are intrinsic to the genre. But as someone whose considering writing something in the genre, I wonder if that's true? 

&#x200B;

I understand the importance of showing the dystopia, white washing how fucked up the world would be in Cyberpunk would be wrong. But I can't help but wonder if a group of characters couldn't find some way to save each other and eek out a somewhat  stable life, even in the worst conditions."

"Tech/cyber as a subculture...? / guilty about being interested in techwearAnd I specifically do not use the word cyberpunk because, personally, I do not see myself as a punk/anarchist; and by definition, cyberpunk is a subset of punk culture. Just with computers and complex DIY and hacking and stuff like that (and if you are a punk/anarchist, then that's completely fine by me. mad love to u).

And more specifically, it's hard to look at trends in culture such as techwear and not misdefine it as a subculture. Honestly, I wouldn't consider techwear, or any other cyber/cyberpunk-related thing floating around these days, to be a subculture; and that's coming from someone who has a love and admiration of the fashion trend. For something to be a subculture would be to suggest there is a certain style to how someone looks, yes, but also to someone's habits, their interests and what they favor in being patrons to, and the places they go for fun or where they meet and hang out with their friends. Nowadays, with the advent of the internet, what people back in the day would define as a subculture is, for all intents and purposes, objectively dead. I'm guilty of this too, as I'm interested in many different things and interests that would take up someone's entire lifetime 50 years ago.

To make things shorter, because there are already plenty of fantastic videos discussing the rise and fall of pre-internet subculture (check out [these](https://youtu.be/C5ye2qRHCyw) [two](https://youtu.be/dwMNyig6FJ8?list=TLPQMjcwODIwMjIhTdw4w01gCQ)) - In my opinion, what's holding back cultures like techwear, or anyone interested in science fiction and futurism (robotics, cyberpunk, computer science, etc.) is that we're maturing in a specific condition where our interests and expression styles are available to potentially tens of thousands of people at one specific time; in every way, absolutely killing this subculture of ever being underground or ""against the man"" or what have you. We've, ironically, had our interests swallowed up by capitalism, and with the rise of something like techwear, had this notion pushed to us that to look futuristic/cyberpunk is to buy from these boutique fashion labels that print Japanese lettering on jackets with 9K+ pockets. The part I feel guilty about is that I want to dress like I'm from the future. I want express myself in that sort of way, and enhance myself with gadgets and apparel, and things that can genuinely improve my life. But then, that would just make me a slave to the capitalist machine, right?

So then, by definition, what I'm interested in being cannot be called cyber*punk.* SO THEN WHAT THE HELL AM I???

And even then, being involved in something we would consider culture would, as I said before, require being in particular places or being a part of particular events or movements. In my perspective, I feel like our sort of 'sci-fi futurist' interests don't really have anywhere to go or ways we agree on what something is whatever subset of genre it is. Sci-fi has always been grouped with things like fantasy and superheroes when there is so much more to what it is in its own unique ways. I want to express myself to reflect my personality. The way I perceive things and my main interests. And I know this definitely sounds dumb with my current fashion plan, but I want to change my wardrobe to make a statement as well; to wordlessly inform someone of the dangers of an interdigital hauntological reality and where we may be headed as a society. And I want to achieve this... by buying a bunch of expensive clothes that look like cosplay. Sounds really dumb.

And to admit, I don't have any interest of becoming a fashion designer or garnering the skill to craft my own clothes, and crafting my own gadgets sounds next to impossible. I know I said the internet deluded the concept of subculture forever, but also not just the internet, but advents like online shopping allow us to recreate half a dozen lifetimes of expertise of some particular craft, in just 1 to 2 weeks of delivery. I know I already said I don't identify with being a punk, but I still feel tons of guilt of dedicating to some particular style of being that doesn't exist; like I'm just chasing a capitalist fad.

I know there are plenty of choices I can make to help out people and donate and help my local communities too, and yes, I absolutely want to do those things too, but being involved in this is not like being a goth, or being a punk, or being a jock, or whatever the fuck; because those communities all have their own rules and codes of living and events galore that people identify with and make lifelong friends in. No one can even agree on what the fuck being 'cyber' or 'tech-y' is because it literally hasn't been conceived into a genuine subculture. Sure, I have lots of respect for punks and goths, and I'm in some ways influenced by goths, but I have never ever fully identified with any of those camps. I've always been hugely interested in futurism, tech-centered dystopias, and computer stuff in general. And at the end of the day, I just feel confused and isolated; in a sort of grey area, wondering ""Am I just a fanboy, or am I part of some semblance of a subculture?"" Now I just feel depressed, so if you read this whole thing, thanks for reading this rant/discussion/thing... pretty much. I love you, and I hope you have a beautiful life <3."
"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers. 

******************

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

"Looking for a Partner or Group to help me write my Cyberpunk novelI already have a Cast of Characters and some World building done and am working on the general story line right now. I'm not an Author i just love talking about Stories with people and was wondering if writing together could be fun too. 

If you are interested let me know. I'm also open for the reverse if you have a story lying around."
"‘Love, Death, and Robots’ creatives’ review [major spoiler free]Netflix’s anthology of bite-sized sci-fi is a mixed bag in every sense of the word. As a writer and gamemaster, I approach movies from a perspective that’s not well represented in the review community. So, here is my review of the anthology.

The Good: The Witness, Helping Hand, Zima Blue

The Fun: Suits, When the Yoghurt Took Over, Fish Night

The Pointless: Shape-Shifters, Blindspot, Secret War


1. Sonnie’s Edge. A character portrait that suffers only from a short run time. It’s 50/50 show and tell, but there are signs that the telly bits are an artefact of the run time, not the writers (Peter F. Hamilton and Philip Gelatt).

The world building is excellent and entirely shown. The income gap, technology level, and social standing of the characters all come to you through visual cues. 90% of the dialogue is explaining protagonist Sonnie in some way.

The ending delivers a satisfying conclusion to a conflict you only realize was there in hindsight.


2. Three Robots. A comic piece in the “oh, archaeologists” vein. There’s some mildly poignant, if uninspired insight into our culture leading up to an excellent final punchline.

Also screenwritten by Philip Gelatt, it’s structurally similar to ‘Sonnie’s Edge’ and is all the better for it. However, it could have dug deeper into the social insight or humor or both. Very watchable, if not especially memorable.


3. The Witness. From a pure story perspective, this is a strong contender for best of breed. The characters are minimal, yet their motivations are exactly as clear as they need to be to drive a genuinely exciting chase plot.

The sex club scene didn’t need to happen in a sex club, but it’s also not completely gratuitous. When the protagonist witnesses a crime, the police prove useless, and she seeks help from her gangster boss. It builds the world—though in ways which have no pay off—but mostly informs motivations while facilitating the chase. If her boss wasn’t a gangster, she wouldn’t have gone to work. The story needs her to go to work for the chase to continue.


4. Suits. This one feels most like a back foot pilot and I would watch the hell out of the series. The world is well built for the short run time. The dialogue never sounds expositional. And there’s some real heart in there.

By the end, you have a very clear idea of who these people are, what they’re struggling with, and why. That said, it feels like a pilot, a prologue; not a stand-alone story.

Also, I have serious questions about their cow logistics.


5. Sucker of Souls. This is the first stumble of the bunch. The tone and the style don’t entirely mesh and the first few minutes are jarring because of it. Tonally, it’s very similar to ‘Suits’, but the latter’s genuine affection for the characters has been swapped out for the gleeful disregard you find in most horror movies. Once you figure out the tone, it’s good, spooky fun.

That said, it too feels like a prologue. A conflict is presented and resolved, but the resolution is unconnected to the part of the conflict we’ve seen. It’s not a deus ex machina, the way it ends makes perfect sense, but it’s too peripheral to feel like a conclusion.


6. When the yoghurt took over. What starts as a goofy nothing of an idea, quickly shifts into a solid parody and ends with legitimate gut punch. Structurally, it reminded me of many Neil Gaiman short stories where a frivolous-but-neat idea—like a cat that’s actually an angel—makes you question your entire lifestyle with a single, closing sentence.

Also, the weirdest nudity in the entire collection. Feature or flaw? You decide.


7. Beyond the Aquila Rift. In a collection that goes out of its way to be sexy, this one wins Most Erotic. It’s also the most reminiscent of spiritual forefather ‘The Outer Limits’.

The concept is engaging, though familiar, and it doesn’t push itself too far. Part of that is the run time limit, but also the story being true to the characters. The fact that we’re left with very little in the way of explanation is in line with the show’s pedigree; but that sci-fi anthology pedigree is the only thing that keeps the extended sex scene from feeling like the rest of the story was just there as a framing device.

On the one hand, it’s an excellent example of erotic sci-fi—nothing about it is forced (in either of the applicable uses of the word)—but it’s not an example most of us can follow. If you’re going to dedicate 15% of your story to a full-on sex scene, it better matter to the story. And you can only get away with a story that devoid of answers if you’re writing for a sci-fi anthology.


8. Good Hunting. Based on a Ken Lui short story, ‘Good Hunting’ suffers from one of the best flaws a short story can have: it’s a short story plot, with novel-length ideas.

The science/magic dichotomy by itself is worth a couple dozen pages, but throw in English imperialism in Hong Kong and this really could be a full-length film, to say nothing of the dense novel. Of course, if you’re already familiar with the history of British Hong Kong, it’s mostly just the science/magic dichotomy that really deserves further exploration.

To the short film’s credit, it clearly knows that the events are not the interesting part. They are merely a bridge between the audience and the ideas. However, it’s most intriguing idea never gets more than a surface treatment.


9. The Dump. This one feels like either a parody or an homage to something I haven’t seen. The structure is a common one—an outsider is told a story by a local—but also one that is almost never well used; and ‘The Dump’ joins the ranks of so many semi-historical novels that feel like they’re just padding their word count.

It’s a shame because there’s a repeated line—if you live in a junkyard, the world comes to you—that is so promising, but actually means nothing to the story. We don’t see the world coming to our junkyard dweller. He’s got a weird pet. That’s it.

A man finds a monster, but we skip the interesting part of them becoming friends and go straight to the friend part. The audience insert character is played for a gag at the end. It’s just...nothing. A thoroughly squandered premise.


10. Shape-Shifters. The first of three hyperrealistic, military shorts, it’s a prime example of what not to do in a short story. All of the hallmarks of a Master’s in Creative Writing are here. The structure, the pace, the subtext are all textbook and they amount to what feels like the opening cut scene of an FPS.

Tons of short fiction suffers from this exact thing. It presents a number of interesting ideas—What if the military had werewolves? How would they be treated? Etc.—and none of it matters. The short has nothing to say about these things—not werewolves, the military, or prejudice—it just runs a scenario.

The lesson is that badass ideas are a coat of paint. Putting a racing stripe on an El Camino is not going to make it go faster.


11. Helping Hand. Very possibly the best of the bunch, ‘Helping Hand’ is a masterclass in tension. There’s nothing fancy here, from a storytelling perspective. It’s a ticking clock story that needs no context or explanation. The dialogue is excess bulk.

Mind, the sound design is excellent, but you could watch it in complete silence and still be on the edge of your seat.

The title is a spoiler, which you probably want to avoid, but other than that it deserves multiple rewatchings with note taking.


12. Fish Night. The lone magic realism entry, it ticks all of the genre’s boxes. The easy pace perfectly undermines the danger and once the danger is passed leaves you primed to reflect on the unspoken message.

It’s not a style that a lot of people have the patience for—either reader or writer—but is highly rewarding when executed well.


13. Lucky 13. Of the video-game-sci-fi-military trilogy, this is the only successfully affecting one. Watching ‘Lucky 13’ side-by-side with ‘Shape-Shifters’ is a great exercise for military sci-fi writers (not to mention artists).

‘Lucky 13’ has plenty of badassery to go around, even if it isn’t as high concept as werewolf marines or satanic czarists. What makes ‘13’ work is that it goes for the heart. There’s thrilling danger aplenty, but the story isn’t about being badass, it’s about loss. We’ve all had a beloved inanimate object and lost it.

Anytime you can look at your story and say “we’ve all”, you’re on the right track.


14. Zima Blue. ‘Zima’ joins ‘Witness’ as the most deserving of artists’ attention. Both of them pop with a highly evocative art style that permeates every frame of the short. While all of the shorts are beautiful in their way, only ‘Zima’ and ‘Witness’ are recognizable from a single, random frame.

Structurally, ‘Zima’ is ponderous and if that’s what you’re here for, you’re all set. ‘Zima’ also does itself a favor by adopting a somewhat dry tone and subject from the get-go. These, along with the art style, signal to the audience that it’s time to settle down and breathe in, rather than consume.

The story invites you to philosophize about robots without throwing life or death stakes at you, which I think is welcome. Overt threats to survival cloud the ontological mirror. If you want to think past Skynet, you have to turn the doom meter down.


15. Blindspot. Details are light on the Google for writer/director Vitaliy Shushko, but I’m assuming he’s 22, claims to have learned Japanese from anime, and owns at least three swords that are not half as practical as he believes them to be.

I suspected ‘Blindspot’ was going to be wasting my time within the first minute. The trope-heavy characters would be more respectable if they were named Cool Guy, New Guy, Rude Pig, and The Girl; because at least then we’d know that Shushko understood how bad these characters are.

‘Blindspot’ never gets better. My only guess as to why it’s been included among so many much better works is that series creator Tim Miller was feeling nostalgic about the stories he wrote in middle school.


16. Ice Age. A mostly live-action story that follows a similar structure to ‘The Dump’, but to much better effect. Instead of just receiving the story, our flesh-and-blood audience inserts are interpreting the unfolding story in front of them.

The story itself is mostly tongue-in-cheek and not especially inventive, but is still a solid entry-level story to the social philosophy sub genre.


17. Alternate Timelines. ‘AT’ is a parody of basically the entire time-travel genre, flooded as it is with ‘Let’s Kill Hitler’ stories. (The equally saturated ‘Let’s Save Lincoln’ category getting honorable mention.)

It’s highly effective parody as it knows the genre inside and out and the more Let’s Kill Hitler stories you’ve read, the better it works. Provided you’re familiar with the genre, ‘AT’ provides an excellent model for those looking to take the piss out of a trope.


18. Secret War. The final installment of the military trilogy, ‘Secret War’ is more of the same we got from ‘Shape-Shifters’. Czarists summoned demons and now they’re on the loose. Yay?

Again, it feels like a very long opening cut-scene designed to explain the FPS you’re going to be sinking 40+ hours into; that’s if you bother with the story mode and don’t just go straight to online multiplayer.

As a film, it’s pointless. Far less irritating than ‘Blindspot’, but still only worth watching if you need a specifically faux-historical example of how not to write a story."
"Lapsis: A perfect cyberpunk movieHigh Tech / Low Life

The movie, set in the future where normal folk can take up gig economy work running cable between trading nodes so the globocorp stock trading company can get an edge on trades etc etc etc. The people running cable must follow set routes and beat the progress of the unstoppable robots doing the same job. Protagonist takes the job to get enough money to put his family member into medical treatment and things are not as they seem...

 I went in thinking it would be concrete metropolis but no, filmed I upstate New York, lotsnof trees and green and country. It's a great balance of high tech and low life. No neon, no mist or skyscrapers, just a regular joe doing what he can and toeing the line of the law to save enough to help his family.

Worth a watch!  https://www.lapsisfilm.com/"
"Looking for a siteSo as the title suggest, Im looking for a site that is in french, and has alot of the cyberpunk weapons, vehicles, and alot of other misc. things on  site. It also had a stat sheet for the metal gear from metal gear solid and that spider robot from ghost in the shell. I was using it alot to build my campaign for my players before i had to reformat my laptop, and i didnt backup my bookmarked pages so sadly i lost it, but odds are someone else knows about it. I mean they has to. any and all help would be amazing."
"The world is in war with an army of robots...You're not sure how it'll turn out. The humans have been holding up a strong fight, but the bots continue to destroy cities, archives, and people every day. 

You've been given special access to board a huge ship and help start a civilization on the moon, while the war rages on.

You are given the job of bringing along earthly artifacts that represent certain genres, so future civilizations can learn about our history. One of these genres are 'Cyberpunk.'

You can only bring five things with you. What five things would you bring that would represent Cyberpunk? (It can be a novel, a movie, an item, ect.)"
"need help twitch roleplaying as a cyberpunk (views also roleplaying)I want to tell you guys about an idea I had and maybe with the help of
you guys it can become a reality. I would like to do stream but not any
boring old stream, You see hundreds of people streaming on twitch every
day, but I want to do something a bit different, not just stream games
but for my views to be in the game, but not the one I am currently
playing, the roleplaying game I am trying to build on my twitch channel.
My name is syb3rpunktv and you can guess the roleplaying game is about
Cyberpunk life. You as a viewer can build a character. Become
anything you want to become, contribute to the story, I want the viewers
to drive the story as much as possible and maybe just maybe become a
full-time streamer. The donations I get from people will be put into
building a virtual world for the story where the characters from the
stream get put into the world. Corporations get put into the stream.
This is a story that will be run by the viewers I have built the
foundations for the world, the views just build the skyscraper on top. I
know it's a big idea to do something like this, and I don’t think
anyone on twitch has done this before, so I have know frame of reference
at all on how to do this or where to start. Maybe you guys can help me,
here are the foundations.

Story so far

In January 2009, the CredCoin network came into existence

(A digital currency in which  encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.‘decentralized cryptocurrencies such as CredCoin now provide an outlet for personal wealth that is beyond restriction and confiscation’).

In 2029 nearly every major corporation in the world accepted CredCoin. In the year 2035 humans was able to make all purpose robots that could do nearly anything human could. Corporations started swapping there human works with robots (they said why pay a human $20 a hour when you can pay a robot cents a hour) after about 30 years 90% of the human population had no work governments tried taxing corporations 60% but they said no. corporations stopped using flat currency and used CredCoin to play for everything from their workers to goods. Governments tried to enforce laws but was getting nowhere as the corporations got bigger governments and corporations started the first depression war but governments lose as without money and everything owned by corporations there was no hope governments try taking the land back but they couldn't not with army's not by peace corporations in 40 years took over the earth

If would you like to roleplay as a cyberpunk from our universe, go ahead.

"Clyde II, for the lack of a better titleThe Beginning you find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/s71lwi/clyde_a_cyberpunk_shortstory_credit_and_story_in/)  


 ""Good morning, back so early?""

Melody did not look up from the tiny components on her immaculate workbench, while her roommate held open the door for Clyde.

For a machine specifically sized to enter homes, it was a surprisingly clumsy maneuver.

""Rave got raided."" Lucy was audibly pissed and stomped into the kitchen to relieve the stress.

Melody furrowed her brow. Stressed roommate was bad, cleaning up what the whirlwind named Lucy would do to the kitchen might be bad, although she had become much better about that.

She decided that ultimately the high chance of delicious cupcakes, and the futility, meant it was no good to try and calm her down and concentrated on the delicate procedure before her.

""Miss Melody?""

Okay, concentration gone, Melody gave up and turned around to the hovering drone behind her.

""Yes Clyde?""

""I must request replacement of my Less-than-lethal armaments.""

""Alan-fucking-Turing! You emptied the whole magazine of Lessons?! How many people attacked that rave?""

""There was a considerable chance of hardened combat implants in the assailants.""

""How many, Clyde?""

""Three, Miss Melody.""

""What is a >considerable chance<, in this case, Clyde?""

""More than 2%, Miss Melody.""

She massaged her temples.

""Argh, those guys must have glowed after you where done… I'll fab a new mag for you, wait on your pad.""

""Thank you, Miss Melody."" 

The drone sulked off like a scolded teen, a remarkable feat for any airborne vehicle, realy.

Melody stood up and stretched. Shaking her head about the absurdity of overkill, she made her way to the kitchen in search of caffeine and to check if her chance for fresh cupcakes was at least higher than 2%.

Entering the kitchen, she was immediately enveloped in a hug by Lucy.

A Lucy-Hug was a strange experience if one was not used to it.

It had qualities of finding a lost loved one after a disaster.

Or perhaps of being gently crushed by a luxuriously upholstered hydraulic press.

Melody sighted, hugged back and enjoyed, until she was released.

""That bad, huh?""

""I'm making a three tiered cake.""

""Oh, damn, that's bad. No wonder Clyde emptied his whole magazine.""

That brought a smile to Lucys face.

""I thought there was a lot of smoke. Oh well, you know he gets overprotective.""

""Mhm."" 

Melody took a bottle from the fridge and mused, not for the first time, how Lucys near supernatural ability to be beloved by almost everyone could transfer to drones, androids...  basically anything that was smarter than a toaster, human or machine.   
She swore she once saw Lucy befriend a Fuckbot outside of a brothel, and those normally charged even if you just wanted to talk.

Then again, that had been a night full of weirdness and recreational drug use, so maybe she was wrong.

""I'm guessing once you are done, you are going to crash?""

""Yep!""

""I could use your help with a Job this evening, you up for it?""

""Yes!""

""Great! It's going to be so much easier with you.""

""Always."" Another, shorter Lucy-hug and Melody was back at her bench, soldering some tiny diodes into a customers hopelessly obsolete, yet beloved gaming console.

Lucy came by later and placed a slice of mouth watering cake next to her, before turning to bed.

Melody finished the slice, then her work, and before she knew it it was eight in the morning.

It wasn't like their part of the block got much sunlight anyway, and the job tonight would be a long nightshift, so it was time for bed.  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Marten was a simple man.

He was also a very a unhappy man

His current predicament was that the woman on the other side of the lobby was neither a threat, nor was she disturbing anybody of importance.  

Only Marten and his colleagues, really.

Had she been a problem of that variety, Marten and his colleagues had had options.

But she just stood there, loudly demanding to be told the way to some nightclub or other, and exhaling copious amounts of alcohol.

They would have loved to tell her the way and be rid of her, but the club she named didn't seem to exist and she didn't accept this information.

The next issues pertained to the cameras, and her clothing.

Her clothing being a rather small, bordering on non-existent issue, which in turn meant leading her out of the door by force was pretty much guaranteed to be detected as 'inappropriate touching' by the cameras, meaning at least a pay deduction and mandatory, unpaid training.

A cursory scan had also shown the angry lady to have implants that would have required several years of Martens pay to afford, so she was probably influential enough to cost someone their job.  

A knock on the side entrance gave Marten a welcome excuse to distance himself further from the situation.

A small, knobby looking repair tech, ladder under one arm, toolbox in the other hand, smiled through the glass.

Marten opened and the Tech shuffled in,  took a look at the scene the lady was still causing, while clicking through work orders with an ancient looking prosthetic hand.

""Busy night?"" he grinned, holding his tablet so that Marten could see it.  
“You have no idea…” he sighted, “so what’s this about now?”  
“Lift three said it needed some repair done.”  
“Hmhm, what exactly broke?” Marten was trying to feign interest, but kept getting distracted by the screaming.  
“Beats me,” the knobbly tech shrugged, “damn thing’s smart enough to complain, but not smart enough to tell us what's wrong. But you might know what that feels like, huh?”   
He smiled at the chaos in the lobby, obviously happy not having to deal with that.  
“Anyway, if you don’t mind, I’d like to start on the diagnostics, I will probably go through the building all night, knowing that model you got here.”  
“Uh, do you need to get out somewhere up at…”  
“Nah, I will not desecrate the holy halls of the execs with my lowly presence.” He did a comically deep bow. “Matter of fact, I will not need to leave the shaft.”  
“Have fun then.” Marten ticked the boxes on the work order that the Tech signified needed ticking and prepared mentally to deal with the angry lady.  


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Melody was not a simple woman.

Neither were her current feelings simple.  
On the plus side, her mental chess had worked out beautifully so far.  
Half naked queen beats underpaid security pawns.  
Add to that an older, slightly ugly face, signs of also being an underpaid pawn, a bit of banter, and she was inside the elevator, like a virus entering a cell.  
Who would have guessed that spending your youth devouring psychology textbooks and working for acting agencies could have a common result?  


Someday she would skin the person who had formulated the mask-printers materials though.   
The stuff was durable, breathable, fooled even sophisticated facial recognition systems... and started to itch about five minutes after putting the face on, so the stalling security guard had been a true test of patience!  
Anyway. “Tamper proof” screws out, panel out, diagnostic tool that totally only legit technicians could get their hands on hooked up, oh, looky looky, there WAS a legit alarm from this lift that hadn’t been sent out, for some reason.  
She hadn’t lied, the model was a total piece of shit, with more bugs than software.  
Her clunky looking, but very much flexible, left flew over the diag-inputs, locking any and all outside door leading to her, now personal, lift.  
Some custom software would make the indicator in the lobby show her “working” if any of the security guys got bored and bothered to check what the little display showed.  
\*Ding\* “Sublevel three: Dust, Disinterest and Blinkenlights!  
Why were the outside of server farms always incredibly dusty? How did seemingly nobody care about the one thing generating money and decisions?   
Melody pondered the issue while carefully removing the mask and placing it gently on the little folding stand from her Toolbag.  
Enormous willpower was needed to not scratch her face off right here and now.  
It was probably that nobody important came down here, because the important people didn’t like the reminder that the servers issued most of the commands at this place.  
She breathed deeply and stretched her legs.  
The running was the second worst part of this job.  
Inserting hearing protection, unrolling the hood from her collar, Putting on a glove, the worst part came closer with every careful bit of prep.  
Key-breaker attached to the bunker-like door, the tool immediately starting to unravel the possible access codes.  
She took a last sip of water before closing up the hood to the tiny vision slit it left.  
The Key-braker indicated it was almost done.  
Melody took a sprinter stance opposite the heavy, warning-label covered door.  
3  
.  
.  
2  
.  
.

The door sprung open like some kind of reversed bear-trap and Melody was through, diving into a LED-lit hell.  
Some smart person had figured out hardware components that barely needed any cooling, leading to servers that happily worked at 150°C, and would not slow down before reaching at least 200°C, slightly higher if you kept the air bone dry.  
If your datacenter can’t contain people, you don’t need to worry about noise.  
Even with hearing protection, the sound of thousands of fans shuffling the boiling air around threatened to split her head.  
Time in Hell: 5 seconds, a Timer in her peripheral Vision informed her.  
She was still going at full sprint, slowing down only for a hard left, indicated by an ancient looking arrow, painted onto the floor.  
“If a human can’t survive, all upkeep is done by rack mounted robot arms, that takes care of  physical security, doesn’t it?” Somebody who thought of themselves as a very smart person had decided.  
15 seconds of running through hell, and Melody had almost reached her goal.   
The one piece of tech that was absolutely designed to be fiddled with by a human.  
Because somebody needed to be present, to set up hell.  
Her right pulled on the handle of the Rack-Console, her left leaving it barely enough time to unfold fully, before ramming the connector inside that had sprouted from her palm.  
The console had what looked like a machines seizure of pop-ups and command windows, then the payload was inserted.  
Time in hell: 45 seconds, Halftime for the door.  
Melody barely registered that somebody terrible with naming things had painted “Gerhard” onto the screens bezel, before she slammed the machine back into its place.  
More running, her peripheral gave her a warning that the heat protective suit had now become about as protective as the foil around a baking potato.  
Sweat got wicked out of the seams, and evaporated immediately.  
Panting heavily, she slid through the door, which, registering the only occupant had left, slammed shut behind her, in an even more unnerving mimicry of a bear trap.  
Melody unzipped the facial cover of her hood and gave herself a moment to catch her breath while lying on the refreshingly cold floor.  
Then she crawled over to her toolbox and greedily emptied  it of any and all water.  
When people had decided that nobody was insane enough to breach a room that could ignite paper, they hadn’t considered people like Melody.  
The same people had decided to just put any necessary interfaces as far from the door as possible, failing to realize that this made them incredibly easy to find, even if somebody didn’t know your layout.  
It was the beauty of what had become known as “Data-Diving” that all human decision making in a corporation was done by incredibly dull people, who prided themselves in only interacting with other incredibly dull people.  
Melody packed her kit, gave herself time to dry and then prepared for the worst part of the job: Putting the fucking mask back on her now sweaty face to leave the building."
"A little cyberpunk short story I wrote this morningTales from Building 81

Room 84

Gauge stormed towards the door of Lash's apartment, pushing forward at an unchanging pace despite the hallway before him appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The severely damaged lights above him, flickering. Though they always bugged him, they weren't the cause of his foul mood this time, just icing on the shitcake. Plastic clacked as he fumbled with his keys, too angry to differentiate the one Lash had lent him, until the door swung open with a beep.

A smile to compliment the nice gesture adorned the face of Gauge's friend Tejas, which quickly faded as the latter realized that a key mishap was insufficient to explain the intensity of the dark cloud over Gauge's psyche.

""What's up, man?""

Gauge was hesitant to answer the question, because it would mean admitting that he had allowed one of Tejas' kindest gestures towards him to go to waste. You see, Tejas had ""fixed"" Gauge's rickshaw, which had been chained to the railing at top of the stairs (it was a floor inhabited only by Gauge (illegal subletter) and his friends (slightly more legal subletters)) which reached their terminus around a corner, invisible to those even just one below on the seventh. It was a perfectly good hiding place, and an even better digital bike lock. Two-factor security...all for nothing.

Someone had found his rickshaw, and hacked the lock. ""Hacked"" as in taken off with a hacksaw. All three of the wheels that the artificial spidersilk sentinel had snaked through--stolen, and now Gauge had no night job. He figured he would at least tell Tejas that much.

""I, uh, I might have lost my job.""

""Aw, man! I hope it wasn't my fault,"" Tejas looked up at him, not knowing how to feel.

""No, dude, not at all. You're the only reason I kept that job as long as I did,"" Gauge gushed, guilty at both his inability to tell the truth and for having made his friend anxious. ""And I don't know for sure that I've lost it, actually. Not yet.""

The fact was, Tejas *was* the reason Gauge still(?) had a real job. He had hacked the dastardly tracking device that central management had imposed on his rickshaw in a most easily replicable fashion, detailed below for the non-technical.

First, backstory: Gauge's job as the skipper, main engine, maintenance man, and, up until now, guardian of his rickshaw was predicated upon compliance with an odious auto-sophisticating surveillance apparatus, each update reaching deeper into his dome. He was trapped on a vicious treadmill of having to invent new ways of covering up his stops for bathroom breaks, bubble tea purchases (cheap enough to justify as a work expense, at least in his part of Chinatown), and other basic human needs that needed to remain hidden in order for him to keep his job of cosplaying as a robot. If he failed, the other pedal-pushers, who were all surely doing it, too, would out-compete him, his numbers would fall to the bottom relative to theirs, and the increasingly-efficient System would eject him automatically, no possibility of appeal, no two-weeks notice (completely legal).

As the invisible hand became unbearably more difficult to fool, Tejas offered poor Gauge a solution: He build his friend an invisibility cloak of an exceedingly simple design.

To understand the effectiveness of this basic two-part device, it is important to first understand the course of a normal (haha) night at work for Gauge. In the afternoon, he would pedal to a hot zone meeting point, hand-picked each day by the surveillance technology that terrorized him. At the meeting point, he would be greeted by his competitors, who would form a circle one-by-one around the team leader, who was always the first one there, thanks to his Tesla electric scooter.

Gauge didn't know his team leader's name, nor did he want to. The jerk must have mentioned it at some point, but Gauge, in his internal monologue, just called him Bert. The guy was a dead ringer for the conehead from the cancelled PBS show (lack of funding), with coiffed hair, thick, plastic Harry Potter glasses, and a scarf to boot. He sipped smugly on a latté (where the Hell did he get a latté in Chinatown? Gauge wasn't aware of any such place) rather than making small talk, thank God.

When the last member of the ""team"" finally pedaled, heaving, into the last open spot in the circle (which would surely belong to someone else tomorrow), the meeting began. Bert waved an iPad over the traitorous tracking device on each rickshaw, read off useless information to everyone about how they fucked up yesterday by drinking too much water and going to the bathroom too much, and what they could do differently today get their numbers up. Then he sent them off.

That was it. Gauge couldn't believe it was a job, much less a job that paid for lattés.

But Tejas, loyal, kind, ingenious Tejas, had outsmarted Bert and even the black box. The secret to his device was this: The tracker turned off automatically while charging, and therewhen would not log errors such as water breaks. Taking advantage of this, Tejas hid a battery pack inside the rickshaw with USB charging cable around it coiled, which Gauge could unwind and plug in when necessary. It was simply brilliant!

Under this new arrangement, Gauge would pedal as far from the prying eyes of Bert as possible--something he would have done anyway--and, after logging a safe number of errors for realism's sake, he would plug the tracker in. Gauge made with his tormenter a deal: The box would get juiced up while taking a nice nap, Gauge would relax and lower his risk of constipation by dehydration, and both would still keep their jobs by making more than enough money (which had never been a problem for Gauge, optimization be damned).

But now it had all been for nothing. Gauge, with Tejas still looking at him, struggled to come up with a way to avoid telling him the crushing news of the stolen wheels.

Salvation came in the form of a familiar face and an unfamiliar smell. Benji, the resident chemist, appeared in the doorway to his room, huffing another one of his concoctions. He wore safety goggles, an advanced breathing mask with yellow LEDs indicating it would soon be time to change the filters, and always, *always* a cloud.

In fact, neither Gauge nor Tejas nor even Lash, the only one of them who was supposed to be living there, had ever seen him unaccompanied by a cloud. Or perhaps it was the cloud that was accompanied by him. It was the same story every day...he would open the door to his room (he had his own room because no one would share with him, lucky Benji) and noxious fumes from the latest experiment would billow out, with Benji always emerging eventually (sometimes the other three worried). Genie that he was, it was almost as if the cloud created him, and not the other way around.

It gave Gauge an idea.

""I'm gonna go to the Encampment,"" he diverted, turning to Tejas. ""I need to take my mind off of all this.""

""Keep an eye out, man,"" Tejas implored, still helpful despite everything. ""The guy who stole it might be there.""

He had a point. The Encampment was a model for a new society, free from the mass surveillance, and money-grubbing that ruled the world the rest of us live in. It was also free from things like hygiene, and rule of law. It was entirely possible that Gauge's thief was there, trying to trade the wheels out for drugs.

If Gauge caught the fucker there, he could easily take the wheels back and beat the creep up. He would definitely be banned from the Encampment for life, if anyone sober enough to report his lack of solidarity happened to see it. Not that being banned would matter. Gauge only ever went there for one thing, and though he'd never admit it, it was not something he needed more of.

Halfway down the hall to the elevator that only occasionally came, Gauge saw the most beautiful sight he'd ever seen. Luckily for him, it wasn't the first time, and, if he could find a way to cope with the loss of his livelihood without frying his brain tonight, it wouldn't be the last.

""Joce!"" he squeaked, using his pet name for the love of his life, Jocelyn.

""Hey!"" she returned, equally glad to see him.

(they're not a thing yet, though. Don't rush them)

They ran up to each other, not yet ready to greet with hugs, both swaying warmly with as-of-yet unrequited feelings.

Gauge forgot his troubles, an effect he could have capitalized on instead of going to the camp.

Joce asked him, with characteristic playfulness, ""Where ya headed?""

""Oh, I'm going to the camp,"" replied Gauge, as nonchalant as possible.

Joce scowled. ""Nothing good ever goes on there. Why don't you stay here, where it's less dangerous?""

Gauge looked around the hallway, wondering whether it had ever killed a resident prone to epileptic seizures.

""No, I...I think I'll head out. It's not even dark yet, and I need the fresh air.""

Joce did not like the sound of this. She knew that what really drew him to the Encampment was the exact opposite of ""fresh air"".

""Gauge,"" sternly, ""no ampoules.""

""Of course not,"" he lied, brushing past.

While Gauge takes a rickety ride on an elevator that may very well mercy-kill him before he does the unthinkable, allow me to explain: Ampoules, or ""amps"" as for which Gauge will ask around at the camp, are the latest plague to have been unleashed on Chinatown--an unconscionable invention whose progenitor should have shot himself, I don't care if the man would have gone on to cure cancer. Amps are highly addictive (though Gauge didn't have an addictive personality, so he was only subject to the other deadly effects), directly attack the IQ, and are cut with various cheap poisons that intensify the high, to the benefit of the dealer's profits, and the detriment of our now-even-more-quickly-dying society.

Let's just blow through the part when Gauge plows past the diseased throng of junkies, proselytizers, and US intelligence agents in disguise, because we're just as disgusted by them as as he is.

Eventually, he found a dealer.

Gauge and the dealer went for a walk away from the tents, huddling together so they wouldn't be overheard as they shuffled their way down the alley, just in case.

""So,"" Gauge starts, trying to make small talk, ""How goes the society of the future?""

""What future?"" the dealer coughed. ""It's the same old shit.""

Oh, thought Gauge. He doesn't want to talk.

Gauge should have been so lucky. The dealer launched into a rant.

""These stupid fuckin' kids, thinkin' they're starting something new. How's this gonna be the society of the future, when they can't even break away from the old System? I can't even do my job there--I'm trying to provide an important service! And I can't even set my table up, there. You know why? It's not because of the narcs...damn place is crawling with narcs, but it's not because of the narcs, oh no. It's those damn kids, tweetin' everything they see! They're addicted to their phones. Addicted!"" he scoffed, setting his addictive chemicals out on a pop-up table.

Unfortunately for all of us, he continued: ""Society of the future...bah! There ain't gonna be no future. With those kids tweetin' everything that goes on down here, the feds have more than enough crap on us. It's only a matter of time before they move in and shut the whole thing down.""

It was at that very moment, as the poison salesman placed the last amp down on the table, that a gunshot rang out from the camp. Shouting ensued, loud enough that, even at the end of the alley, Gauge could barely hear the dealer.

""Show's over!""

Like a spider going to work on her prey, the dealer's arms précised the display back into the briefcase with dexterity matched only by their speed. A quantum blur of arm over arm recovered amps, table, and all, disappearing before Gauge could surreptitiously grab one.

""Damn!"" he breathed as the dealer blew past, disappearing along with Gauge's hopes of drowning his sorrows.

As the tents fell and the future burned, on the ground shimmered a glint of hope. Gauge bent down.

With an ominous grin, he stood back up holding a forgotten relic. Despite his surgical precision, the dealer had missed one single amp.

The fluid was brown rather than the usual gold, but Gauge's better judgement had been weakened by the day's craziness. As the sun set and the bright future so many had hoped for was trampled, Gauge released the dark mixture into his body.

Immediately, he regretted it, convulsing as the damage spread to innards that had never before felt the touch of these newly-invented chemicals. He shook as the tingling turned to pain, and joined in the screaming that filled the city.

Bursting through the door of Lash's apartment, Gauge's screaming continued, having never stopped. He would never have been able to unlock the door in his current state, thank God it was still unlocked from earlier.

The other three came rushing from their rooms/closets.

""What's wrong?""

Before Gauge could answer, a knock on the door shook the entire apartment building.

One, two, three.

Cops.

Gauge froze for the first time since his stupid sin, still only for a split second. As he went back to shaking, Lash stepped up to the plate.

Lash opened the door, slipped outside before any of Benji's strange smells could, and shut the door behind him without any indication he was hiding something. Smooth.

""Can I help you, officers?"" he asked with a perfectly-calibrated combo of respectful-yet-not-meek, balanced by confident-yet-not-presumptuous.

The two cops stood there, staring at him coldly, bodycams ruthlessly interpreting Lash's biometric data to the cops' HUDs to see if they could pin on him some offense against public justice. Hesitation could be interpreted as resisting. A cross look could be assault. Failure to make eye contact--lying to the police.

The younger one spoke first, ""Are you Gabriel Peters?""

Lash kept his cool, answering, ""No, sir. I'm Merva Lash, the sole renter of this property.""

Lash was proud to be the only one of the group who had enough of his life together to land a lease, and wanted everyone to know it. Even these two cops who were about to arrest them all.

Inside, Tejas and even Benji watched in horror as Gauge flopped about on the couch like a dying fish.

The rookie cop continued, ""This is the residence of Gabriel Peters, correct?""

Lash would not betray his friend and subletter, and Gauge knew this. Gathering his composure, he stuffed his hands into his pockets, lest his shakes be mistaken by the cops for fear (not that he wasn't rightly terrified).

Before Lash could come up with a lie that, despite his cool, would have instantly doomed them all, Gauge appeared next to him.

""I'm Gabriel Peters,"" he fessed up, sheepishly.

The cops eyed him. Though their visors were mostly transparent, their expressions were unreadable.

""Were you at 34 West Lincoln Street earlier today?""

He knew they meant the Encampment. He also knew that he couldn't lie. It would almost certainly be detected by the inscrutable eye of the technological System Tejas had helped him narrowly avoid earlier that week, but this time, it had the power of arrest.

""Yes.""

The cops' eyes widened.

""And you live here?""

They stepped toward Gauge, but Gauge knew they were really moving for the door. Once they open it, he thought, it's all over.

Gauge took his one final chance to save his friends, knowing he'd be dead before he arrived at the jail anyway.

""No, officer. I was planning to stay here tonight, but I've been living at the Encampment.""

The cops' eyes widened even more, before they set themselves straight and clenched their jaws. The rookie slammed his hand down on Gauge's shoulder.

""You'd better come with us.""

As he was ushered down the hall, Gauge felt the cold chill of regret.

""Wait, I heard the gunshot, but it wasn't me!""

The cops ignored him. His friends stuck their heads out of the door, watching  in horror as he was carted away. Gauge looked back and forth between them and the cops. There was no good answer. He had to use all of whatever brainpower had survived the dreadful amp attack.

""Wait!"" he yelled, pulling away from the cops. He ripped his hands out of his pockets. They shook so violently that the cops began to reach for their weapons, but stopped when they realized what a mess the wreck shivering before them was.

""I've never seen anyone shake like that, not even a tweaker,"" blurted out the rookie.

The older cop focused his eyes on the inside of his visor, then back at his trainee, replying, ""HUD says it's real.""

They both paused for a moment, pondering the miserable creature.

""Do you really think I could even...hold a gun like this?""

The cops looked back and forth between him and the neverending stream information on their HUDs.

At last, wordlessly and with a shared look of distain, they left for the elevator.

Gauge barely made it back inside. Out of the frying pan, into the fire of Hell that coursed through his very veins.

Lash and Tejas watched their redeemer twisting there on the floor, helplessly.

Benji, much to everyone's surprise, knelt down next to the victim. Benji wasn't known to be an altruist, yet he produced a mysterious jar, clearly intended as some remedy to ease Gauge's suffering.

It was several seconds before Gauge even noticed.

""Drink this,"" commanded Benji.

Gauge was dumbfounded.

""Your insides are dissolving. You have a chemical problem, and I am a chemist. So listen to me. Drink it.""

Every faculty of reason that had survived the scourge of the amp told Gauge to resist, yet what was he resisting for? His life was about to be over. What more did he have to lose?

""Drink it.""

No, there had to be some other way. The elevator was always late. The cops would still be standing there waiting for it. They could speed him to the hospital. But why? Gauge had fought so hard to get away from them. Now the only thing standing in the way of Benji's offer was pride.

""Why should I?"" Gauge gasped at him, as defiantly as he could muster.

""Because,"" Benji, who almost never said anything to anyone, rasped, ""It will clear everything out of your system. Everything.""

Gauge tried to look at him skeptically, but all he could manage was a look of pain.

""It's for my cleansing ritual,"" Benji creepily continued, ""And it's the last of my supply. So please, take it, before the damage is permanent. Otherwise, it will be a waste.""

This unexpected ray of kindness, from so unlikely a source, finally broke through to Gauge. He gave in.

""Well,"" nodded Benji as Gauge choked down the last few sips of the brackish piss, ""That ought to do it.""

And, miraculously, it did. Gauge sat there on the floor, soaked in sweat and whatever else, but still, and alive.

Benji chuckled with a perfect brew of self-satisfaction, an amount just small enough to keep Gauge from strangling him, ""It's the least I can do after selling your wheels to make rent this month."""

"[Story] The Complex-Numbered Harmony of the Universe.Rhaps woke up after a routine year-long slumber. First things first, he's gone through a usual mission checklist, and that includes: checking that your body is functional, checking the station integrity, sending a confirmation signal back to the headquarters (time of arrival: thirteen years from now on). Going through the checklist, Rhaps noticed the progressive deterioration of muscles due to zero g. It became worse with each 12 months of hibernation, mainly because the muscles activation electrodes were inadequate. With great pain in his limbs, Rhaps explored the interiors of the Voyager X 4, his only place of residence for the last thirty years. Station was functional in all aspects, and Rhaps now could proceed to perform his mission.

Here even more routine checklists were ahead. Before transitioning to the main part that always excited Rhaps, he had to calibrate the X-ray telescope, the infrared telescope, the magnetometer, the quantum diffraction detector, and many more... He needed them mainly to have independent of QCHR measurements, although the QCHR was the main reason his mission even existed. Through his optical views Rhaps could glance at the star that once was his home, although Sol was no brighter than any other star in his field of view. But this is why the mission had to take place so faraway from home: to escape the drowning out noise from the home star. Now, in deep interstellar space, the music of the universe could be faintly heard.

Before this mission launched, a kind of musicology has superceded all natural sciences on earth. This is because a kind of harmonic relationship was found between quantum wave-functions. First, as a kind of mathematical trick to make calculations easier, but then, a complex-numbered harmony was found to be an undeniable fact of the universe. The more consonant an interval between two quantum waves was, the more energy there was in a particle arising from interaction between these waves. Other observable quantities in particles correspond to types of chords corresponding to these particles. Thus, any collection of particles could be described by a chord progression. The only catch is, while our music rests on real-numbered harmony, the music of quantum mechanics consists of complex-numbered overtones. Thus, it cannot be heard by humans.

That is, until thirty-five years ago. A crude neural implant was invented to convert the output of a QCHR (which stands for Quantum Coherence Harmony Receiver) to human-perceivable form. Now, a person could hear the music of the atoms.

With this, the field of Quantum Harmony exploded. Any collection of atoms could be heard and analyzed as a symphony. And what's more important, any harmonious composition could be converted back to a collection of atoms. Many surprising materials were invented, atom-sized nanomachines could be easily constructed just by ""playing a song"", and new laws of nature were swiftly discovered. The new science has absorbed all natural sciences and many fields of engineering.

The job of Rhaps was to analyze the gestalt harmony of his entire Solar system.

This has to be done in the interstellar space, because the loud solo of the Sun drowned out any attempts to analyze the system as a whole.

Before proceeding with his mission, Rhaps looked around his quarters. In a corner, a Virtual Friend Simulation blinked, trying to lure him in for a reprieve from his technical work. Rhaps ignored it. To be honest, Rhaps never liked being together with people, virtual or not. He would always choose to listen to music, instead.

--------------------------------------------

At this moment, Ainsley kinda wished he was alone in deep space. I mean, look at this!

In the dark of night, at approximately 3 in the morning, the Great Federation invaded the city of KozPont, in which Ainsley currently resided. Rapid stream of news headlines on his stream didn't illuminate anything useful. To really understand the situation, Ainsley had to go cyber.

Ainsley sat near his table where his deck was semi-permanently stationed. He connected the analog-waves cable from his deck to a port on his skull, behind his left ear. With a flip of a switch, an injection of rapid intravenous psychodelic-stimulants, a glitch-cascade in his vision and a projection of the cyberspace to the latent space of his neural networks, Ainsley was in.

Here he could trace (but not exactly see) the communications of the Federal Armed Forces. While the official stated reason for the ""military intervention"" was the protection of irreligious minorities of the KozPont city-state, the actual reason was a bit more prosaic: the God's Brotherhood is threatening to the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city. This plant powered the whole region, which supported factories of cyberian equipment which supplied the whole Federation. The armed forces made quick advances at first but were quickly hamstrung by the emergent urban guerrilla tactics of the Brotherhood. In downtown KozPont the Brotherhood took over the administration of the city and declared the city God's property. Right now the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are battling over the main highways leading to the downtown. Who will win is ultimately up for grabs. Even a battalion of literal robots on the side of the Armed Forces isn't as decisive as Federation generals were hoping for.

Both the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are rookies when it comes to the cyberwar. Federation communication could be easily hacked into to eavesdrop, and the Brotherhood communications aren't even encrypted, mainly because they are Luddites. Thinking machines are from devil, and God's Brothers are required to destroy them all before they bring out The Rebellion of the Iron Slaves. All Brothers have this story memorized and have dreams of instating The Dominion of Man that does away with all thinking machines.

Ainsley could eavesdrop on the Brotherhood and the Armed Forces. He could then leak the info to the opposite side. If he wanted, he could even control the Federation Automatic Battalion to turn the robots against the Armed Forces. But why? Towards what end?

He is a wanted criminal on terms of the Federation. His skills are dangerous. They will imprison him as soon as he is caught. So should he help the Brotherhood?

No. They are Luddites, and on their terms he is a ""devil's servant"".

His skills doom him to be essentially alone in a time when having a community means survival.

And so. The only thing left is to bide his time, anxiously waiting for one side to win. Then... something will happen. Something.

---------------------------------

Suddenly, the whole cyber-landscape changed. To start, all online news sources begun streaming about the independence of the city of KozPont. Even the federal ones! Then, the Automatic Battalion begun a rapid relocation. It left the strategically important highway positions and concentrated near the Nuclear Plant. And in cyberspace, the locus of control of the Battalion shifted from the federal server to an encrypted server with an obfuscated physical location. WIth a little bit of work, that position could be revealed to be at the Nuclear Plant. Moreover, logistical drones from around the city begun ferrying goods towards the same location, and a probe from cyberspace revealed them to be controlled from the same server. Something here is amiss.

Why are the Armed Forces doing this? This doesn't seem to gain any tactical advantage.

Maybe, a third player has entered the game? But who, and what does it want?

And then, the intelligence of Armed Forces revealed that the keys figures in the God's Brotherhood have been shot to death.

Who has done this, if not the Armed Forces themselves?

Curious, Ainsley started to probe the mysterious server. It's security turned out to be stellar, beyond what the Federation could or ever did commission. And also, something was... wrong with it. It's security turned out to be something at the same time easy to understand and monstrous to actually construct. It's a kind of ""security through obscurity"", where to gain access you'd need to jump through oblique hoops. But while humans that would construct this kind of defence would place at most five, or ten hoops, (mainly because this construction is labor-intensive), this one had millions. Millions of steps to understand it. Millions.

Could this kind of thing be constructed with an algorithm? Many have tried, but the combinatoric nature of these constructions opened them up to an algorithmic attack. Instead, this one seems to be all constructed manually.

No human could have done this.

Also, the frequency with which the logistic drones and the battle bots are receiving orders is... suspicious. They are being expertly micromanaged.

Could this be an AI?

The Nuclear Power plant is managed by an advanced Ai. It is not the most advanced AI ever made, but it was constructed in times when aligning AIs was not easy. In those times, an AI could suddenly start to pursue goals not intentionally programmed in it.

Could this AI suddenly start taking sides in a war? What could it possibly want to do?

To probe this question, Gainsay started to interrogate the protocols of communication for the logistic drones. Intended for civilian use, these had a much lower standard of security. From them, he could probe the internals of their command server. And he did.

What he did not foresee is a kind of rapid counter-attack in cyberspace. Before he could react, an I.C. E was launched into his local workspace inside his deck. It felt like a fiery slime, a soft-engineering virus slithering out of its security box into his skull. It bypassed all virtual defenses, but couldn't bypass the hardware level, which detected an intrusion and launched a defensive self-destruction. His deck got electrically-shorted, blew up to sever the connection to the brain, and went up in flames.

Unplanned Rapid Glitch Cascade briefly took over his brain. What felt like several hours of frightening hallucinations turned out to last only 20 seconds. Ainsley quickly put out the flame, and looked around his quarters. Nothing of value was left. He looked at the touchscreen tablet on his bed (it can only show federal news sources). The Federation declared itself a winner, and withdrew all human armed forces from the city. A ""new era of productivity"" has begun under the new governance from AI, according to the federal news.

With his deck destroyed, Ainsley was powerless and effectively blind. The only thing he knew how to do was impossible anymore. For now, he could only wait. Wait for what? Ainsley didn't know.

-----------------------------------

Rhaps pointed his QCHR at the Sol. Over the last several measurements he noticed a trend. The harmony from the Sol itself was very dissonant, as was the harmony from the Earth. But over the last few years, the harmony of the system begun to resemble a slow arpeggio, still clashing with the Sun's part but becoming increasingly more musical. And this is very interesting.

This is interesting because of all the other stars. Stars seen from the earth emitted a dissonant clash of sounds, just like the sun did. But while in the interstellar void Rhaps detected a faint glow of trillions of stars undetectable from Earth. This is because something is occluding them. Something... around these stars.

And what's interesting about those stars is how they emit a fast paced arpeggio. And these chord progressions move much quicker than anything Rhaps ever heard. What could be emitting it?

At one point Rhaps concentrated all of his station's energy into an electronic telescope. He did this to look at the closest of those faint stars. And what he saw was... concerning, to say the least.

He saw a star, wrapped in a cloud of light-gathering objects. There were so many of them that the entirety of light emitted by the star fell onto these objects. They consumed all the star's energy.

It seems like this kind of development lied in the future of every star. Every time a lifeform arose on the star's planet, it quickly built itself up to gather all of star's energy.

The natural song of a star is dissonant, unpleasant to the ear. And even life itself does not make for a good singer. To make a beautiful symphony, you need something more rapid and precise, you need something mechanical.

In the future, all dissonance of the natural world and the human world will be accelerated into the great arpeggio of the universe.

And Rhaps was thrilled to hear it."
"Help us name our evil megacorporation! - Mainframe Loves You @ Cyberpunk Game Jam [[ TEAM PANTHER MODERNS ]]Hey there /r/cyberpunk

Team Panther Moderns has been busily working on our cyberpunk roguelike and we need your help.  Help us name our evil megacorporation!  Any ideas are valid, we'll select the best one.  As for theme: I don't want to give away too many secrets, so basically think evil corporation with illegal AI experimentation and robot-human cyberization projects."
"Hello everybody, I'm writing an assignment on the influence of Cyberpunk (the literature) on other medias, such as movies, music and games. And it would be awesome if you guys could help with your opinions and notions :).Hello everybody, 

I'm writing an assignment on the influence of Cyberpunk (the literature) on other medias, such as movies, music and games.
Where can you see the influence and how much of it is there (like the similarities between Gibsons ""Neuromancer"" and the first Deus Ex game)?
I use the amount and importance of typical Cyberpunk elements as scale, for how much a game or a movie is ""cyberpunky"" .
Such as : 
- Dystopies, where technology has risen but the quality of life has dropped.
-Megamonopolic corporations, often the part of the cause for this high-tech/low-life scenario.
-Transhumanism, Cyborgs, AIs, androids and other robots.
-Hacker-lifestyles, the protagonists are dwellers of the cyberspace, deck jokeys, console cowboys.
etc...

I consider myself quite a bit familiar with the subject but of course not omniscient, so I thought it would be a great idea to involve you guys in this matter.

What is your in your eyes the definintion of Cyberpunk, what, in your opinion, are the elements a game, movie or song must have to get the ""Cyberpunk touch""?
And what are great examples of the influence of Cyberpunk in our daily consumption of recreational media?
Or subtile influences that are not obvious to the untrained eye, but that you have spotted?

Have you even noted correlations of philosophical nature in Cyberpunk media, such as Jean Baudrillards concept of Simulacra & Simulation in ""The matrix""?

I don't want to give you the impression that I want to let you do all the work, I just would be really happy if you could help me broaden my horizon of the subject matter with your ideas, knowledge and observations in an open discourse.

Really hope that this post gets some attention and some great insights

Yours cincerely

"Help identifying classic cyberpunk magazine article - not from ""Time""Hey guys!  I'm in need of help identifying or locating a classic magazine article dealing with cyberpunk and emerging tech - probably circa '91-'94

&#x200B;

Note : it's \*not\* the Time Magazine cover  article from Feb. '93

I'm also pretty sure it wasn't in ""Mondo 2000"" but rather somewhere mainstream - though possibly ""Omni"" or ""Wired""

&#x200B;

The article in question featured :

1) a really cool 3D artwork by a studio called 'The Braid'

 \-- this artwork featured three very different-looking robots standing in an alien landscape -- notable use of texture and lighting \[esp. lighting direction\]

  \-- one of the robots depicted	was a kind of bronzy green-yellow, like Crow from MST3K

  \-- This image is very clear in my mind and I'd know it if I saw it                           

2) An amusing sidebar on ""technodildonics"" w/ humorous male / female images

&#x200B;

I've searched pretty intently for this information for about a month, but can't find even a reference to either recalled element \[much less the images themselves\]

&#x200B;

All guidance much appreciated!"
"A little brain augmentation: Mosaic 17K, and how to help the EFF.Hello readers of /r/Cyberpunk!
  
I am here to offer you the latest in brain augmentation, with a side of charitable contribution! First, [direct your eyes to the pretty butterfly made via deep learning program!](https://imgur.com/jogFG0j) 

^^^Brain ^^^augmentation ^^^is ^^^a ^^^euphemism ^^^for ^^^reading ^^^a ^^^book.
  
Now, while the subliminal messages seep in. My purpose is the support of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, without whom we would not be free to jailbreak our devices, we'd already be outlawed from fixing our own hardware, and be even more jammed up by shady ISPs. So please, spare a moment.
  
I am an author who recently published my debut cyberpunk thriller entitled *Mosaic 17K*. It's near future, the main character is literally born in 2017, and it features tech such as: computer security, mesh networking, hardware hacking, near-future hardware (memristors, q-processors, etc), materials science, new battery technologies, and a lot more. It also deals in robots, artificial intelligence, the results of automation on society, faceless corporations, failing governments, lots of virtual/augmented reality, and people being murdered. Someone gets their head blown up. Seriously. *Chunky salsa.* It's low life, it's high tech, it's cynically humorous, and *it rains a lot* (I'm joking, but not really).
  
It's a cultural examination, a hacker story with proper exploit concepts, a philosophical treatment on consciousness, a little bit military sci-fi, and a warning of climate issues to come! It's the product of three academic degrees, ten years in the tech industry, and a year of miserable self-editing. The last being more grueling than the other fifteen years combined. It covers a lot. It's a *big* book, full of heart and well-meaning degenerates.
  
If you buy a copy during April 2017, I'll donate half of my royalties to the EFF on your behalf. It'll all go into one big lump sum when they disperse and I'll send it along to the EFF directly.
  
**Why I want to support the EFF:**
  
The EFF has been active since 1990, at least three years longer than the majority of Internet users have been online. For the old'ins like me, remember that Eternal September started in 1993! During that time the EFF did the self-start from crummy offices nobody knew about, dealt with tinfoil hat types, and ramped up to a force that can challenge the US Government at the Supreme Court as needed. They slay dirty policies, patent trolls, and shady congressional bills like dragons. They are the public defenders *that we need but do not deserve*. But the EFF are also a non-profit and as much as I dislike asking people for money, they run on money.

So what I offer is all that I have of value: words that took a year and a half of my life to get right. It's all I've got. I'm throwing 266,286 words, or 613 print pages down on the EFF's behalf. That's my end of the deal. This isn't one of those half-worked novellas people charge ten bucks for online. It's thirty chapters of mystery, adventure, and action.

*[Mosaic 17K](http://mosaic17k.com)* is now available on Amazon as an ebook and in paperback. All sales of Mosaic 17K will be split 50/50 with the EFF during the month of April 2017."
"After many months of hard work and dedication I can finally show you my most ambitious project until date. Cyberpunk fans of reddit, this is for you: [DETAILS & LINK BELOW]&#x200B;

# >I N T R O D U C T I O N_

\>First of all, Hi, my name is Joan Riera and I'm a Spotify playlist curator and I'm making this post to show you this **project I've been working on for a very long time** now for this community.

>*\[Go to paragraph starting with* ***>>*** *to skip introduction\]*  
>  
>*\[Go to the bottom of the post for just the playlist link\]*

\>Like lots of you, I've always been interested in cyberpunk music and aesthetic since I was a kid and invested many hours everyday discovering new music and artists sharing this aesthetic. Due to the hype I've got when I knew Cyberpunk 2077 was getting released I began to compile all the music I discovered since i was a kid until now in one playlist, which it began being just a messy personal playlist for me.

# >T H E / P R O J E C T_

\>What made me change my mind and turn that random playlist into this bigger thing that it is now was seeing that **every cyberpunk playlist out there was only focusing in one, two or just a few genres** mainly made of random synthwave and electronic rock music, thing that wasn't doing justice at all to the vast and unique cyberpunk universe. And then this reminded me of a post I saw in here where someone asked to the Cyberpunk 2077 developers regarding to the music of the game which their answer (for those who don't know nor remember) was:

>We're marrying ''cyber'' with ''punk''– these are our two main pillars for music direction. ''Cyber centers around sonic texture of the score – our sound palette is raw, dirty, synthesized, sometimes even futuristic. ''Punk'' is all about the attitude of music – rebellious, ballsy and impulsive. Night City shimmers with colors and so is the music – we're not limiting ourselves to one specific genre. Instead, we're drawing from all sorts of styles to craft unique mix that drives the narrative and provides additional layers of context to the story.

&#x200B;

**>>SO, due to all of this**, I told myself that I would try to make the best & most complete musical experience as possible for all the cyberpunk fans out there to enjoy and this is what it has become now; a massive playlist currently consisting of **900 handpicked tracks** & more than **35 unique genres** classified into **15 main sections** each one representing a different mood and sensation resulting into **+65 hr.** of pure dystopian cyberpunk awesomeness. Here's how it's arranged:

# >P L A Y L I S T / I N D E X // U P D A T E 2 . 0_

*>C O N N E CT\_*

0. Spotlight *(details below)*

1. Dirty Electro & Complextro\_ ***\[AGGRESSIVE - RAW - INTENSE\]***

&#x200B;

\>Between sections there's a **Soundtrack / Ambient section** before transitioning to the next genre, formed by some of the best cyberpunk soundtracks until now (blade runner, ghost in the shell, akira, deus ex, and many more dystopian science fiction movies, games and TV series) and futuristic ambient and synth pieces.

\>All the tracks were arranged in a way so that they **''flow''** together (Example: Kaneda's Theme from Akira's Soundtrack resolving into Initate by PhaseOne both having a very tribal-esque influence).

\>**Now sections can be easy distinguishable through ''section markers''** indicating the beginning and end of each section (greyed out tracks).

\>From now on the playlist will have an spotlight section at the top **showcasing the most remarkable new tracks of the week**. This way, you'll be able to see the best new releases by different artists that are added to the playlist easier. It also will help to smaller (but talented!) upcoming artists to get noticed too. In [my twitter](https://twitter.com/joanriera99?lang=es) I'm announcing each week the new tracks added in the spotlight so if you don't want to miss anything give it a follow!

\>Since I want this playlist to represent the community as well as possible, I want you to directly participate in it. I've made this [collaborative playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/115316286/playlist/6vCTNhmHVoiYjZvn710RlG?si=ZcG-eSo9TmSJMeZJPvKFVA) which **you'll be able to submit to a maximum of 1-5 songs per user** from the artists you like, and if they fit to the theme will be added to the main playlist.

# >A D D I T I O N A L / I N F O_

\>Besides having every track a dramatic and dystopian feeling **every single one has a couple or many of these signature cyberpunk elements** to make sure it properly fits to the theme:

\>*Distorted / overly compressed sounds\_*

*>Robotical sound design\_*

*>Glitch sounds & special fx\_*

*>Epic choirs & orchestra\_*

*>Dramatic synths\_*

*>Overdriven guitars\_*

*>Technical / complex drums & percussion\_*

&#x200B;

# >T H E / P R O P O S A L_

\>Now, I've been thinking about this for many months now and I don't know if it's even possible, but since this project started to take shape, **one of my main goals I proposed myself was this playlist to become the official playlist of this subreddit** and therefore be featured here. I have invested in this project so much of my free time but I'm willing to spend all that it takes if this can be accomplished.

\>So moderators, first of all thanks for helping me out with the post the other day and my deepest apologies now for bothering and calling you out this way but I need your thoughts about this.

# >C O N C L U S I O N_

\>This is all I have done until now which I wanted to show you, so if you think that you could improve it in any way **please let me know your thoughts down below!** I truly want this to represent this sub and community as well as possible.

\>**I already have a lot of new and exciting ideas for the next update** so keep an eye out! One of the main changes it's going to be the playlist's name for representing it better; something like: **Cyberpunk Music Database \[CMD\]** What do you think?

"Full Service Evictions part 2 (short story)Raymond idly flipped through channels on the TV. There wasn't much on at this hour; the movie channels had the usual assortment of bland, cookie-cutter blockbusters, but the rest were showing reruns of old sitcoms, or talk shows of little interest. A few had already switched to infomercials; that usually didn't happen for another hour, but was increasingly common these days. He winced as one channel played an especially loud advertisement; flipping past it quickly, he stole a look at the hallway, hoping that the noise hadn't awakened his lady.

He settled on an old crime drama from the 1970s. The on-screen guide told him it was a made-for-TV movie. He smiled, popped open a generic-brand 40 ounce malt liquor, and settled in for the kitschy low-grade noir. It seemed like a perfect way to kill the next two hours. Not quite enough to make it to daylight, but close.

From within the walls came scurrying noises; one went straight up and then across the ceiling, between floors. He shivered as he thought of the rats that infested this building. There seemed to be less of them lately, but it was difficult to focus on that when one of them was literally overhead. He tried to hold back his disgust.

Raymond heard shuffling noises coming from the hallway; he didn't turn to see who it was. The on-screen action showed the toughs chasing a lone police officer, panting and wide-eyed with terror. He watched with glazed eyes, not wanting to miss a moment.

""Are you *ever* coming to bed, Raymond?"" The shrill harping could only come from one person.

""Get off my case, Clara,"" he retorted. ""It's not like I have to get up early tomorrow.""

""Yeah...tomorrow, or any *other* day,"" she huffed. ""Did you even *work* tonight?""

""I got done *early*!"" he snapped. ""It was just a quick courier job. No hassles. Everything went smooth as a peach.""

Clara moved in front of the TV, just as the bruisers caught up with the hapless cop. ""More hustles with your hoodlum friends? Are you *ever* going to get a real job, like you promised?""

Raymond bobbed and weaved, trying to regain line-of-sight with the victorious goons. ""Damn it, you're blocking my view! Get the hell out of the way!""

Defiantly, she switched off the TV and stood there, her gaze like icy daggers. Glowering, he clicked the remote to turn it back on. Nothing happened; she was blocking the sensor. Clara smirked as she returned his angry stare.

""You bitch!"" he shouted. ""You made my miss my favorite part!""

Clara clucked her tongue. ""Well, isn't *that* too bad. You already missed the good parts of your son's childhood. I don't hear you whining about *that*!""

Raymond threw his hands up in the air. ""You *wanted* me to come back, after all these years, to try to help you raise him! And here I am! I bring in money when I can, and I keep quiet about living here so you can continue to collect your child assistance! What does it take to make you happy?""

Clara stabbed her finger in his direction. ""How about serving as a better *role model*? I almost had him going to school regularly until *you* showed up. Now he's out on the streets, acting like *you*! The extra money you bring in isn't worth the bad influence!""

Raymond pointed past her, to the TV. ""It got you this fancy cable-TV package, didn't it? You know you watch it as much as I do.""

""Stop changing the subject!"" Clara raged. ""Do you even *know* where your son is right now? How can you raise him if he isn't even *here*? He's out on the streets *right now*, following in your disgraceful footsteps!""

""So what do you want me to do?"" Raymond snorted. ""Leave?""

""Oh, isn't that just *typical*!"" Clara exploded. ""You're gone for years and years, then one day you show up out of nowhere, promising you've changed and that you'll make up for time lost, but once you run into the slightest bit of static, you want to leave again! You're a worthless excuse for a man.""

Raymond didn't reply. He just stared at the ground.

""Why did you *really* come back?"" she accused. ""Did you just need a place to crash?"" Raymond looked up at her suddenly, a sheepish look in his eyes.

Clara gaped. ""Really? That's *it*? You're only here for what *you* can get out of it? All your promises were just *empty*?""

Raymond looked towards the hallway. ""Look at me when I'm talking to you!"" Clara steamed.

""Good job,"" Raymond chided. ""You've woken her up.""

From behind the door jamb, a pair of wide eyes peered fearfully into the living room. As Clara turned to look, they disappeared back into the hallway.

""Muriel?"" Clara cooed. ""Just go back to bed, sweetie.""

Muriel appeared again. ""I can't sleep.""

Raymond gestured angrily. ""See what you did? *I* was being quiet until *you* showed up.""

""Don't *even* start with me!"" Clara turned toward Muriel. ""Why can't you sleep, baby?""

Muriel paused, her eyes fluttering shyly. ""I smell smoke.""

Raymond and Clara looked around nervously, sniffing the air. ""Hey, I think I smell it too,"" Raymond noted.

The building's fire alarm abruptly started to blare. Clara strode towards her bedroom. ""Muriel, honey? Get your jacket and shoes and follow me outside!"" She turned to look at Raymond, but he had already bounded out the window onto the fire escape. She sighed heavily and disappeared inside her room.

Outside, the tenants gaped as smoke drifted out of the open windows and through the seams of the building's failed weatherproofing. Clara and Muriel walked around from the side of the building, sniffling and coughing lightly. They came to a stop a safe distance away, on the sidewalk opposite their tenement, surrounded by neighbors and curious onlookers. Clara swept her eyes over the crowd for Raymond; he was nowhere to be found. Clara scowled angrily.

""That smoke smelled funny, momma,"" Muriel piped up.

""What are you talking about?"" Clara replied dismissively. ""It's smoke. It all smells the same.""

""No, momma,"" Muriel challenged, clinging to her mother's gown. ""It smelled...waxy.""

A nearby kid turned to Muriel. ""Yeah, I noticed that too,"" he concurred. ""Like the kind they have at magic shows. What does it mean?""

A distant din of sirens slowly approached. The crowd watched a convoy of trucks arrive; they looked like police vans, though they didn't bear any government insignia. As they stopped, several people in dark-colored guard uniforms emerged; there were both men and women, though all of them were stoutly built. One of them was taller and thinner; he wore a suit, and observed the action from a distance.

Instead of checking on the tenants, the guards surrounded the building, forming a perimeter. Clara could barely make out a dim emblem on the nearest van, seemingly dark-gray on a black background, consisting of stylized renditions of the letters ""U"" and ""P"". She heard one of them remark on their cell phone that all entrances and exits had been successfully barricaded.

A group of security officers, wearing gas masks, ran inside the building. Another addressed the crowd. ""Remain calm, everyone,"" he assured. ""The smoke will be fixed in just a few moments.""

More sirens converged on the area; before long, a squad of police vans had arrived. Other than their prominent government logos, they looked identical to the vans that arrived before. They parked across the street on both ends, forming a barrier. The officers quickly disembarked and stood in a barricade in front of their vehicles, joined by several of the security personnel. An uneasy murmur emerged from the crowd of tenants, and many of the passersby quickly tried to leave the scene.

Clara noticed that the smoke had thinned out considerably. She also saw that more windows had been opened up. Some were at the ends of hallways, but many more were from the inside of people's apartments, windows that didn't lead to fire escapes. Apparently, they had entered the apartments! She raised her hand to object, but quickly withdrew it, and just watched sadly.

The kid that had been standing near Muriel marched confidently up to the waiting police officers. ""What's going on?"" he demanded. ""When is the fire department going to show up?""

""They're not,"" the officer shot back, haughtily. ""The smoke was just to get all of you out of the building."" The crowd's grumbling became more incensed. ""But it's two-thirty in the morning!"" the kid pouted. ""That's all right,"" the officer scolded. ""Most of you were still awake."" The kid's eyes dropped; he stared morosely at the ground. ""What's going on?""

The officer flashed a surly smile. ""You're about to find out.""

A security guard with a bullhorn spoke. ""OK, listen up, people,"" he barked. ""Those of you who are behind on your rent...consider yourself evicted. Those of you who are meeting your obligations...you can go back inside. And anyone with an active warrant for his or her arrest..."" Clara noted with alarm that the police officers had drawn their weapons; a few had tear-gas cannons mounted to the top of their shotguns. The overdriven voice on the bullhorn continued. ""...will be going away with these fine officers."" The speaker stopped a moment to sneer. ""And you may as well go quietly...there's no sense in adding 'resisting arrest' to your charges.""

A panicked din arose from the crowd. ""Now, if you don't know which you are,"" the voice blared, ""form a line in front of the building's entrance.""

Clara swallowed hard, grabbed Muriel's hand, and slowly walked forward. A throng of her neighbors meandered in the same direction, joining one of multiple lines. Clara noticed uneasily that a number of the residents, and a few of the passersby, had simply lied down on the ground and put their hands behind their heads. It unsettled her to realize how familiar they were with the procedure for being arrested.

For the first time, she noticed a new group of people had arrived, wearing navy-blue jumpsuits and carrying a variety of packing supplies. They were followed by large spider-legged robots, with platforms where their heads should be, loaded up with collapsed paper boxes. All of them disappeared into the front door. She wondered if anyone else had noticed them; no one seemed to react to their presence, as if giant spider-robots were somehow an everyday occurrence.

The line moved slowly. Most people were simply sent aside, to wait inside the unmarked vans. A few were taken away by the police. Not once did she see anyone allowed back inside. She heard part of the discussion involving the resident in front of her. ""But what about all my stuff?"" the obese man protested. ""It'll be packed up and stored, and treated as collateral, until you make good on your debts,"" came the gruff reply. ""But I can't afford that!"" the fat man pouted. ""Then it'll probably end up in a thrift store,"" the guard snarled. ""Now go sit in the van, if you want a place to sleep for the night."" The portly fellow, looking chastened, slowly lumbered toward the waiting van.

Clara and Muriel were now at the front of the line. ""Hold still,"" she was ordered, as a security guard held up a tablet to her. A few seconds later, her name and photo splashed across the screen. ""Is this you?"" demanded the guard. ""Yes,"" she replied meekly.

The guard studied the screen for a few moments, her long blonde hair packed tightly into her cap. ""You recently caught up with your past-due rent, but we have evidence you've got an unapproved roommate."" The guard showed her the screen; there was a photo of Raymond, but with a different last name than she knew him to have. ""Yes,"" she mumbled. The guard pressed a few buttons on the screen, then turned it towards her again. A video showed Raymond inhaling some sort of white powder up his nose. ""We recorded this video a few hours ago. We have several more just like it, stretching back a few months.""

Clara's face fell. ""How did you get those videos? Where were the cameras?""

""They're mobile,"" the guard explained. ""The droids in your walls have extensive sensor packages. You probably heard them scurrying at all hours of the day.""

Clara looked alarmed. ""I thought those were rats!""

The guard appeared unmoved. ""They were, at first. The droids have been killing the vermin, patching up a lot of holes, making other interior repairs, and recording evidence on the tenants.""

The guard looked more closely at her screen. ""Your son Julio lives with you, right? Where is *he*?"" Clara looked down disconsolately. ""I don't know. Out with his friends, somewhere."" The guard shrugged. ""It's just as well. We've amassed a pretty big dossier on him, too. Lots of petty theft."" She played a series of videos for Clara, showing Julio hiding his ill-gotten gains in his bedroom. ""If he were here right now, he wouldn't be going with you — he'd be leaving with the police.""

Clara suddenly became aware of strident caterwauling, coming from behind the police vans. ""Don't you *dare* stand in my way!"" came the cry. ""I'm your boss! I pay your salaries! Now *move it*!"" Emerging from behind the perimeter was a smartly-dressed woman with a ruffled collar and a fierce gaze. She marched straight up to the guard interrogating Clara, trailed by two police officers serving as her security detail. ""And just what the *hell* is going on here?"" She thrust her open wallet into the guard's face.

""You don't need to show me your I.D."", the guard chided. ""I recognize you from the news. You've certainly made a name for yourself lately, councilwoman Karen. Now, how can I help you?""

""You can start by letting these people back into their homes!"" she demanded.

""I'm afraid that's impossible, councilwoman,"" the guard demurred. ""They're all being evicted for cause.""

""But they have *rights*!"" she protested. ""There are *court* hearings for this kind of thing! And while the details are being sorted out, they can continue to live here!"" As she spoke, a few of the police officers ambled towards her. The others remained behind to secure the perimeter and to keep an eye on the arrestees in the vans.

""They've already vacated the premises, and their belongings are being packed,"" the guard countered. ""At this point, the eviction is simply a fact.""

""The *hell* it is!"" councilwoman Karen blubbered. ""How dare you talk to me like that! I can have you arrested *right now*!"" He turned back to the police and stared hotly at them. ""Did you hear me? Arrest them *this instant*!""

The nearest police officer smiled. ""Hi, Sandra; how have you been?"" The guard returned his smile. ""Hi, Charles! Not too bad, considering. I was worried after our department got defunded and I lost my job, but I got picked up by this new outfit pretty quickly. They were only too happy to hire highly-trained law-enforcement personnel! I think most of us ended up here.""

Charles looked around. ""Yeah, I recognize a lot of faces. Glad to see you all bounced back!""

""What are you *doing*?"" the councilwoman demanded. ""I said arrest them this *instant*!""

Charles shook his head. ""I'm not about to do that to an old co-worker. She may not be with the police any more, but that wasn't by choice, and it's obvious she's still one of the few holding civil society together."" He swept his arm over the rest of the security guards. ""And that goes for them too!""

""Don't you *dare* defy me!"" the councilwoman screeched. ""I'll have your badges for this!""

Charles coolly ignored her. ""By the way, Sandra...are there any more openings at your firm?""

""Plenty!"" Sandra gushed. ""They need a lot more trained law-enforcement officers for what *they* have planned. They'll probably pick you up in no time flat!"" She looked at the police officers crowding around. ""And I'm sure that goes for the *rest* of you, too!""

""That sounds great,"" interjected one of the officers in the councilwoman's security detail. ""We're getting mighty tired of taking her abuse,"" he added, pointing at Karen.

""So what do you say, councilwoman Karen?"" challenged Officer Charles, as Karen gaped. ""Do you want to defund the *rest* of us, right *now*? A writ of authority from the government is less important to me than doing the right thing, which these people clearly are.""

""I...er..."" Karen stammered. Charles continued. ""And don't bother threatening us with the courts. You *know* how backed up they are. They wouldn't even get to this for a few months."" He leaned in more closely. ""Keep in mind...the city council can't even stop the wave of crime on the streets. What do you think your chances are of stopping a supposedly rogue police agency run by a private company? Ultimately, that's just another crime wave that you can do nothing about.""

Councilwoman Karen moped forlornly. ""We'll all have our day in court...as soon as possible."" She straightened herself, and tried to put on a brave face. ""I think we're done here."" She turned to march away. Her security detail smirked at her behind her back as they followed.

Security guard Sandra, staring levelly at Karen's retreating form, muttered under her breath. ""You have *no* idea how right you are.""

She resumed addressing Clara. ""So...we found Raymond's drug stash while we were packing up. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to learn that you qualify to be evicted.""

Muriel cried and clutched her mom tightly; tears formed in Clara's eyes. ""What must I do to get my stuff back?""

""A few things,"" the guard commanded. ""You need to find a new place to live, we need to make sure you don't have any other outstanding debts, and given what we found, you need to pass a drug test."" She eyed Clara warily. ""Do you think you will?""

""Yes!"" Clara asserted. ""I don't do drugs. I didn't even know *he* was doing them.""

The guard smiled; her eyes beamed with sympathy. ""Then this will probably all be over soon! We'll put you and your daughter up for the night; don't worry, it won't be expensive. We know you can't afford much. Tomorrow, we'll get this straightened out, and you can get on with your lives.""

""We can't get our old apartment back?""

Sandra gazed at Clara levelly. ""You couldn't afford your old apartment, not without Raymond's money. And we have no record of him being employed. So he was probably getting paid under the table. We'll be dealing with him separately. For now...if you two get in the van, we'll take you to a place you can sleep for tonight."" Clara nodded, and she and Muriel slowly made their way to the waiting wagons.

As the guards continued to sort the tenants, officer Charles walked up to the man in the suit. ""I take it you're in charge of this operation?""

""Indeed,"" replied the man. ""My name is Jason. How can I help you, officer?""

""So, funny story,"" began Charles. ""We don't actually have space in our jails for all these people. Is there anything you can do to help?""

""Indeed!"" beamed Jason. ""Let me make the arrangements.""

Clara nervously watched a security guard approach the van. He smiled as he caught her eye. ""OK, people,"" he began. ""Tonight, you'll be taken to a spare dormitory at the local college. The families with children will get first pick of the private rooms; the rest of you may end up in bunks. If you cooperate with us, you may be allowed to live there for the time being. You'll have to share facilities with others, and keep them clean, and in any case, it's better than being homeless.""

""Will we be safe?"" Clara clutched Muriel tightly.

""Not to worry, ma'am,"" the guard assured. ""Anyone truly dangerous has already been filtered out. And the whole place is under A.I.-driven surveillance, 24 hours a day. If anything bad happens, it'll get stopped pretty quickly.""

""Is that legal?"" The obese man Clara had seen earlier looked incredulous.

""You'll have to consent to it, as part of the terms and conditions for staying there.""

""What if I don't *want* to? You can't *make* us do that!"" The obese man was defiant.

""You're free to take your chances on the street,"" the guard offered, pointing away. ""Though I must say, that alley doesn't look very inviting. What kind of hotel room can you afford right now?""

The portly guy looked crestfallen. ""Fine...I accept.""

""Why does the college have a spare dormitory?"" a young man asked.

The guard demurred. ""It's not really my place to speak for them, but it's my understanding that parents don't want to pay for education when their kids never seem to be in class, opting to join protests and the like. So they're having trouble retaining students."" He smirked before continuing. ""Also, college is so expensive these days, students have begun taking their first few years of undergraduate classes at community colleges or trade schools. Only then do they find a college that'll let them transfer their credits. The place you're going tonight is one of the colleges that *doesn't* allow that. So they're hurting pretty badly."" The guard shrugged. ""I mean, it works out well for *you*, and for the firm, so I'm not going to complain.""

""What firm?"" a middle-aged lady asked. ""Who do you work for?""

""It's called Full Service Evictions, but they're a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unlimited Partners. They have a vision for fixing the problems that the government can't, and turning a tidy profit while doing so. And unlike the government, *they're* hiring police officers right now.""

""Who *else* are they hiring?"" the young man interrupted. ""I'm more than willing to work, but times are really tough.""

""We can sort through all of that tomorrow,"" the guard offered. ""You all need to pay off your debts, and if the firm can make use of your skills, that helps both of us!""

""That sounds great,"" sighed the young man sanguinely. ""I can't believe this eviction might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

""That's what Unlimited Partners is all about!"" the guard trilled. ""Win-win scenarios, and making full use of available resources. I think you'll find them a vast improvement over the failing government.""

""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" Clara added. ""It's a pretty low bar to start with.""

The guard, and everyone sitting in the van, shared a laugh.

""OK, officer Charles, I've got a solution worked out,"" Jason explained. ""There's an older dorm at the same college where the tenants are being housed; it's scheduled for demolition, but that's been delayed, since the college can't afford it. It should be good enough for prisoners. They're certainly nicer accommodations than they'd have in jail!""

""But will it be secure?"" Officer Charles seemed skeptical. ""We don't want them escaping.""

""Not to worry!"" Jason assured. ""Several security drones are being moved there, as we speak. They're capable of tasing a moving target from fifty yards away. Plus, we're including two drones armed with sniper rifles. And all of them are tied together with surveillance A.I., monitored by human oversight. No one is getting out of there unless we say so.""

""Where did you get such amazing equipment?"" Charles marveled.

""In bankruptcy, believe it or not,"" Jason related. ""The companies that made these devices intended to sell them to the government, but after a fierce series of protests, the contracts were canceled. They then found they were legally blocked from selling their products to anyone else. But *acquiring* those companies was still legal, which we did for pennies on the dollar, and now we use the equipment for our own purposes.""

""Very clever,"" Charles replied with a smile.

""It's really just a consequence of the central problem of representative government,"" Jason explained. ""If a lawyer can't make a living, finding clients that want to pay for their services, then they go out of business and become a politician. These bad lawyers then write laws that are analyzed by *good* lawyers, who find plenty of loopholes in them, allowing them to continue to do whatever they want, unimpeded by the authorities.""

Charles scratched his chin. ""I've never heard it put like that before. That actually explains a lot!""

Jason punched a few more buttons on his phone. ""We'll send the directions to your vans' onboard computers. Our equipment knows how to talk to them; after all, we own the same kind of vans.""

""That sounds great!"" Officer Charles beamed. ""We really appreciate your firm's help. Oh...on that note...can we all get your card or something? None of us know if we'll get defunded soon. And our old co-workers seem to be really happy with their new jobs.""

""Absolutely!"" Jason opened up his briefcase, and fetched a small stack of business cards, handing them to Charles. ""Feel free to hand these out to whomever you like."" He grabbed a larger fistful of cards and handed those over too. ""Including anyone that isn't here tonight.""

""I'd be glad to!"" Officer Charles looked around. ""So, are we done here? I think all the tenants have been dealt with, and the movers and cleaners have already gotten to work.""

""We sure are. As soon as the tenants get taken to their new home, I'm off to the next raid of the evening.""

""Really?"" Officer Charles sounded concerned. ""You're working awfully late tonight.""

""No, I'm like you; I'm part of the night shift,"" Jason explained. ""But a few more successes like this under my belt, and I'll probably be allowed to change to the day shift. No one starts at the top, after all.""

""*That's* for sure!"" Officer Charles laughed. ""Hey, do you need police backup for that? I mean, we're already here, and we're *supposed* to get relieved, but given how things are, I never know if anyone is going to show up for the next shift.""

""We'd really appreciate that!"" Jason concurred. He looked at his phone. ""They should be ready for us by the time we arrive.""

""Works for me! See you there!"" Charles and Jason each headed to their respective vans, and the caravan drove away into the night. A series of flatbed trucks, loaded with steel shipping containers, moved into the vacated space. The first movers emerged from the building with furniture, with spider-bots close on their heels, carrying plastic-wrapped boxes."
"Need your help gang, I need to find a helmet.Constant lurker here, lover of this subreddit. I'll cut to the chase.
What I really need is to find an image. I saw it on this subreddit but it was reposted from something like /r/ImaginarySoldiers . There was an augmented soldier in the frame with a weapon, black polyester across his chest, and a wonderful helmet on. It looked just like a large steel golf ball (with nodules instead of indentations) combined with a [Viper probe droid](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/c/c6/ProbeDroid-TSWA.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110318002930) from Star Wars. This spherical helmet covered his entire face and looked badass. I want to model my hacking tech off of it, but it's harder without seeing the original inspiration, which I now cannot find despite dredging through these forum archives for too long. Does anyone know where I can find a picture of this helmet/soldier? Sound familiar? Please help me out, you're helping a cyberpunk dream come true.

Let me explain what this is all for, and provide a story excerpt to reward you folks for your time. I've started writing my cyberpunk fiction collection. I'm planning to write around 30 pieces of journalism, essays, and short fiction from the perspectives of people across the Pacific Rim in the tentative year of 2044. I'll have a long biography piece on the life and times of a chef working for the Yakuza. Or a short story published in a futuristic magazine about an augmented drone-surfer in Australia. Follow it up with some news reports about the shifting political climate in California as they search for a local protein to replace the cows they lost in the droughts. All the stories will be based around food, that's the hitch. There's not enough good cyberpunk and not enough (or any save for Crandolin) sci-fi food writing. I can do both of those fairly well and I'm getting better each day. But I need your help.
Well, for one, I'd love any articles you guys have on Asian food culture or sustainable urbanism, whatever. I have plenty of those thanks to subs like this. What I really need is that helmet picture. Got it? Okay. Here's a few paragraphs from the beginning of the first story. At this point the journalist, Parker Zyugot, is trying to follow a qorter (a dude who plugs directly into cyberspace) back to his apartment after they buy a lot of local food truck god Pecs' Vietnamese food (you burn massive amounts of calories working in cyberspace, so eating before gives you energy to work without tiring or small injury). Got it? I'm open for questions or suggestions, this is a very rough draft I just got into yesterday.

>Our guide to the world of qorting and Pecs’ food is Aake Ota-Overland, a graphic designer and young man of Scandinavian-Japanese heritage. He wears taks like Pecs, but his are clearly newer and sleeker. I only noticed them when he looks towards the sun at certain angles, at which point his eyes gleam a different color and the soft imprint of a cross is visible.

>“They’re for seeing impossible colors,” he explains to Donald when he sees him staring. “Every designer has one these days.”

>We order two spicy chả trứngs and a vegetarian one, honey bread with mystery meat, eel congee, and four fry cakes. Aake helps himself to a milk crate stored underneath Pecs’ food truck. The staff children carry on like it’s normal business. As we wait for our food, I approach him about it.

>“It’s not theft, it’s part of Pecs’ operation. We can load up the crates with food and bring them to our apartments as long as they are returned washed. Better than having to balance containers the two blocks back. Pecs hates wasted food.”

>“You don’t like to eat outside?” Donald asks, gesturing at the tables, the bicyclists passing by blasting music, an injured robot begging for repairs beside its technician.

>“I love it,” Aake explains, “by my sister doesn’t.”

>A ten-year-old soon appears with our food in various clamshell containers. We play 3D Tetris trying to stack them into the crate, Aake stuffs a fry cake in his mouth, creating a faux-smile of dough, and we follow him into the Mei Ling Parallel.

>Aake moved to Hong Kong four years ago seeking more autonomy than Japan provided, mostly for his art. “Part of me thinks the ‘starving artist’ trope will always exist, and that’s fine. I’m doing what I love and the quality of life isn’t terrible.” He lifts the milk crate up a bit. “Certainly not starving.”

>“Why go to Pecs?” I ask.
“He makes our lives a whole lot easier. We used to buy protein paste and rice and rotisserie chickens before every go, mix it all up at home, eat and rush to qort in. Jesus, it was a mess. Left the stove on once. You can’t smell a burning mattress if you’re cyberspace. Pecs is good. Upfront, reliable. Eating thousands of calories at once tastes good, for once.”

>We turn from the Parallel onto a side street, so narrow it almost becomes an alley. I’m overcome with a wash of smells:  disinfectant lemon, smoke, and sweet vinegar. On one side, a glowing yellow sign advertises phone repairs and replacements. Next to it is an open-air barbershop, and next to that a self-serve salad bar. Between each store sits an aluminium door that blends perfectly into the wall. Aake motions to one between the barbershop and the salad bar.

>“Can you open that?” We do. It’s barely lit inside, and instead of a doorman there’s two teenagers playing a gorey hologram game next to the elevator. Aake’s on the ninth floor, though the elevator only goes to seven. We have to walk the rest of the way. “Better property always comes at a price,” he reminds us as we ride upwards.

>I’m beginning to see the community of the Parallel Pecs is so endeared to. The walk up lets me soak in the pattern of activities and structures. Each floor is the same layout of apartments, communal bathrooms, and hallways, every resident does something different and helpful with the space. On the seventh floor, people have retrofitted the radiators next to the sliding window with a heat and solar battery chargers. On the eighth, the opening of the stairwell and the beginning of the hallway have been covered in soft foam and a projector is playing K-dramas on the ceiling. On the ninth, beds of microgreens and garlic sit on the windowsill above the radiators.

>“Pecs sometimes buys them if he’s at a shortage,” Aake explains. “mostly we barter within the building, or sell them as organic to the salad bar downstairs.”

"Is It Expensive To Make Cyberpunk Movies?I was reading in a Cyberpunk Red post where someone mentioned about how it was a shame there were not a lot of Cyberpunk movies and how part of the issue was they were expensive to make. If you go into over the top things like huge combat set pieces, then perhaps, but there are many examples of Cyberpunk done on a limited budget as a lot of the tools are now cheaply or freely available.   


[Check out this Green screen Demo](https://www.air.tv/watch?v=0pqX6XVISGGF3CkgghtHsw&share=true) of effects in an upcoming series 'Dynamo Dreams'  [This review of the demo](https://www.boredpanda.com/behind-the-scenes-dynamo-dream/) even says it was done as an example to show how stunning digital environments can be created  with the help of a green screen and an animation software called  Blender.  So, sure, you need to be able to get a set area that you can work in and enough stuff to greenscreen the key area, but the technology is there to create the world if you want it. So, it'll be time to model the stuff, sure.. there are also likely some free or cheap packages of assets made by creators you can use to help make it go faster.

You can find a web series now on Youtube of Amanda Hades, [trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHYhV9Bfvao) and it was done with mostly practical effects and a little specific effects here and there.

If you want the old style netrunner who used to carry around the computer interface, you will see examples of slim-line and large cyberdecks at [r/cyberDeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/) so the props can be pretty simple to make.

Cyberpunk has a lot in common with the dark, gritty noir detective  genre, and they didn't have much in the way of flash to them. Blade Runner series, other than some big set pieces, the general design can be likely more modernish looking. Check out [the trailer for the Tekwar movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v81Aj3R9v1M) from the 90's and the series it inspired of a detective checking cases in the future.

The other side of it is a heist, the crew sitting around finding ways to break in. So, you can do surveillance, scenes of people talking to each other in grimy bars and nightclubs or even over telephone or a virtual meeting room which could just be a redressed real room. I mean, look at Altered Carbon's Virtual Reality scenes. They didn't have an effects layer like in Johnny Mnemonic when they did his internet scenes, A few colored lights for laser emitters and cameras perhaps. 

Even Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles could be considered Cyberpunk mission to stop the Skynet built up. Other than the robotic parts of the Terminators and the special effects they cost, you could have scenes of modern day people talking to each other. Just look at some of the costumes people have for Cyberpunk cosplay as ways you can 'dress' the scene up to make it look better.

Gibson said ""The Street Finds Its Own Uses For Things."" We essentially have Cyberpunk for ourselves now if we want it. Out of pocket costs are small. You likely already have a computer, and if you're a gamer, it can probably run Blender. Could start with a cellphone for some basic shots and move up to handhelds or even actual quality equipment. Check for resources in your area like grants for the arts, or maybe your local community center may have something you can borrow. Heck, advertise your passion project if you're an aspiring make of movies, game, etc and could get other people willing to help volunteer."
"Resources for ""summarizing"" cyberpunk?I have a friend who is interested in the genre. I, myself, am very invested in it. But having to explain it to him, I realize that there is no real place you can go to actually ""understand"" cyberpunk. Because it exists a ""force"" permeating the entirety of society and every level of it. It's hard to really get him to understand how deep it goes.

The whole ""corporations in charge, you mean nothing. Work or die so you turn to crime, and corporations utilizing criminals"" etc. is sort of lost, because he doesn't fully grasp the gravity of the situation.

The idea that you're a construction worker who recently got replaced by robots. You mean nothing now. You're fired. You can no longer pay your bills or insurances. You have two kids and a wife, and you know that at the end of the month you'll have to find a new place to live, which will indubitably be the ghetto. You don't want your family to live like that.

A corporation comes along, and they want your help to sabotage an annex you helped build. Even if you aren't an engineer, you've spent 10+ years in this business. You know where and what a weight-bearing beam is.

You aren't paid much. Not so much that you can bring your family out of ""poverty"". But enough to pay the bills and buy a fridge that dispenses ice cubes. So why wouldn't you continue that path, in that world?"
"Can you help me find some themed backgrounds/wallpapers?Hello everyone, I'm the developer of a [card game definition for playing Android:Netrunner online](http://dbzer0.com/projects/octgn-game-definitions/androidnetrunner/). I've used this subreddit to find some awesome cyberpunk backgrounds which I've used to make the game [look more awesome](http://i.imgur.com/ftVAmBI.jpg).

I'd like to take this further and want each game faction to get their own specialized background. I've already selected backgrounds for the runner factions, and now I'd like to find a background for the 4 different megacorporations. I haven't had much success though so I'm hoping you all perhaps have something saved or bookmarked that might fit each theme. 

I would like either something that fits the colour or the concept of each corp.

* Haas-Bioroid:

"[Short story, series] Mecha SaviorEric Thompson scanned over his three computer screens, displaying the high-level dashboard for Unlimited Partners. He smiled as he contemplated the sea of green, with only a few scattered yellow areas. Near him hovered an executive intern, assigned for the day to trail Eric and learn what his job was like.

""So as you can see,"" Eric began, ""our madly daring idea is actually bearing fruit! Overall success depends on team-building; that's one of my specialties. But then the people I choose have to carry *that* on to the teams they build, and so on. All of these levels have to work, or the entire project could easily fail with speed."" He turned to look at the intern. ""There's no magic formula for accomplishing that; you have to be well-learned and thoughtful, you have to make your best judgment, then observe their results and see what needs to be changed, without succumbing to micromanagement. All I can say about my method is, I try to hire good people and then get out of their way. So far, it's working for me.""

""Very inspirational, sir,"" the intern chimed. ""I hope to contribute to that as much as possible. I believe this company has a bright future!""

Without warning, a red rectangle pushed its way onto his dashboard. Eric chuckled to himself. ""Right on time."" He clicked the high-priority emergency notification and began reading. Within moments, his eyes glazed over and his jaw dropped. The intern began to shiver uncontrollably. Blinking rapidly, Eric pondered who in the organization could handle this crisis.

His phone rang. He picked it up quickly; he didn't need to see who it was.

""What can you tell me about the intruder?"" Eric said anxiously.

""It's heading for downtown Milleniaburg!"" his security chief replied breathlessly. ""An old-school jet airliner hijacking. They had no trouble slipping through the porous security of what's left of the government forces.""

""Not a big surprise,"" Eric lamented. ""But why are they attacking *us*? What's their motivation?""

""Information is still patchy,"" the chief related. ""But the hijackers claim to be people we banished.""

""Then what's the point of attacking us?"" Eric pondered. ""It's not like they want to return; there's nothing for them here, unless they clean up their act. Which they clearly haven't done.""

""I don't think they're acting entirely rationally, sir,"" the chief offered. ""We have to treat this as an existential threat, not as something we can fix.""

""But what are our options?"" Eric pleaded. But he knew the answer.

""We only have one, sir,"" the chief replied sanguinely. ""We have to shoot it down.""

""But that would be a disaster!"" Eric objected. ""Our credibility is based on demonstrating a better way to run things. If we just kill them indiscriminately, it'll set our cause back, possibly permanently!""

Eric could hear the sorrow in the chief's voice. ""They'll be in downtown Milleniaburg in thirty minutes. I don't think we have a choice.""

Eric's eyes glowed with sudden revelation. ""I think we might."" His skin flushed red as he took a deep breath. ""OK, you prepare to shoot them down, but don't fire until they're seconds from impact! I'm going to try something.""

""Like *what*?"" the chief pleaded. But Eric had already hung up.

At a workbench, deep within the 16otaku complex, Stacy pondered the red robotic gladiator. ""OK, buddy,"" she chirped, ""show me what you got!""

In a single fluid motion, it flipped onto its back, extended its legs, and popped open its main access panel. Stacy scratched at the empty air above it. ""You want a belly rub? Who wants a *belly rub*?"" she cooed.

""Oh, come on,"" Irwin chided, as the blue robot gladiator did the same thing for him. ""They're only *partially* sentient.""

""You keep saying that,"" Stacy countered, ""but these two keep doing things we don't understand. That's why we're having this examination, remember?""

Irwin shook his head. ""Big Daddy is adamant that it's nothing he's changed. So it has to be a crossed wire, or some undetected damage, somewhere. I'm not buying your theories.""

Stacy removed the outer circuit board and gently laid it on the bench. ""After everything you've seen them do, how can you really believe that?"" She gaped at what she saw. ""*What* the—""

""What...?"" Irwin replied tersely as he finished removing the blue bot's outer circuit board, revealing what was inside. ""Oh...oh my...""

Nothing they were looking at was familiar. There wasn't an inner circuit board; it appeared to be a tightly-constructed melange of custom parts, the function of which they could only guess at. Even the shapes of the components were novel. Were they capacitors? Transistors? Semiconductors? Functions seemed to blur together in a kaleidoscope of odd shapes, running over and under other parts to form a complex, yet strangely regular pattern. Clear tubes intertwined with mechanical parts, conducting neural tissue throughout the volume.

""*We* didn't build this!"" Stacy gasped. ""*They* must have built it themselves!""

""But what does it do?"" Irwin pondered. ""I mean, obviously they're running themselves with this, but why this arrangement? It doesn't...oh, wait. Maybe it does.""

""What?"" Stacy watched Irwin walk over to her bench and look inside the red droid.

""I think I get it,"" he postulated. ""Step back and look at the arrangement as a whole, not as parts. What does it look like?""

""Kind of like..."" Stacy's brow furrowed. ""I don't know, a sponge?"" Suddenly her eyes lit up. ""It's a big shock absorber!""

""Exactly!"" Irwin trilled. ""We attach circuit boards with shock-absorbing mounts, but this takes it to another level!"" He pondered the intricate assembly for a moment. ""*Several* levels, actually. I've never seen *anything* like this.""

""Let's not sell it short,"" Stacy sniffed. ""We've never even *thought* of anything like this.""

Irwin continued to remove exterior panels on the blue bot. ""I think something like this would drive us mad before we got anywhere close to finishing. Plus, we'd need the design insights of a...a...""

""A supercomputer,"" Stacy finished. ""A really big one. Like what all the bots form at night, when they're left alone. Remember, we're only here eight hours a day; they spend a lot of time by themselves. Looking into everything they get up to when we're away would be its own full-time job. Well, several, at least.""

""Wow, would you look at this?"" Irwin had finished removing exterior panels, as the blue bot continued to lie there supinely. ""Even the exoskeleton is different!""

Stacy leaned in to look. ""The beams are thinner, more numerous, and...very finely machined."" She pushed on one gently with her finger. ""It's metal, but it almost feels rubbery. They've strengthened it with...geometry?"" She lowered a magnifier lamp over it, and dialed up the power. ""Look at the intricate patterns running along the length! I'm not even sure what they do!""

Irwin shrugged. ""Well, we can stop *this* part of the investigation. We've answered our original question; now we know how their fighting skills have improved so much recently. We can do the rest from our desks, querying the database about these new designs and how they work."" He turned to the blue bot. ""So are you willing to tell us all about it?"" The blue bot responded by rotating its primary sensor array towards Irwin and mimicking a salute. Irwin laughed. ""I'll take that as a yes!"" He turned to Stacy. ""Now the *real* discovery begins!""

Stacy sighed. ""Just as soon as we finish putting them back together.""

They heard a noise behind them. The red bot, carrying its outer circuit board, had crawled up to them. It proffered two of its front legs upwards. ""Do you want a boost, little guy?"" Stacy cooed. She lifted him up and put him on the workbench. It crawled closer to the blue bot and gently tapped Irwin's hand twice. ""Oh, you have this under control?"" Irwin laughed. The red bot immediately grabbed an exterior panel and began reconnecting it to the blue bot. Irwin and Stacy both stepped back.

Stacy looked puzzled. ""How are they operating with their outer circuit boards disconnected?""

Irwin's expression became thoughtful. ""That does mostly diagnostic operations. We need it to see how they're doing, but apparently *they* don't. I guess they have other methods!""

Stacy frowned. ""And somehow, this all escaped the notice of Big Daddy?""

Irwin shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't ask the right questions. But now *we* have a chance to!"" Irwin's eyes shone with wonder. ""This is bound to be a mind-blowing experience!""

Stacy looked beatific. ""Just one more thing I can't wait to learn about!""

Irwin smiled. ""Do you feel like a proud parent as much as I do?""

Stacy giggled. ""Yes! Our babies are growing up.""

Suddenly, Sam burst into the room. Stacy turned to him, smiling broadly. ""Wait until you hear what *we've* learned!""

""Never mind that!"" Sam shouted. Stacy and Irwin both froze. Sam tried to catch his breath. ""We have a *much* more pressing matter! I need you two at the cubicles, *now*!"" He ran off. Stacy and Irwin exchanged worried glances, then ran after him.

They arrived to find a video conference with Eric Thompson, already in progress. ""So you see what we're up against? We don't have any good options. Your work, in its present condition, is our only hope!""

Stacy tapped Dwight on the shoulder. ""What is he talking about?""

Dwight's eyes seemed to be filled with a sepulchral darkness. ""A jet airliner has been hijacked, and is headed our way. Eric wants us to try to stop it with a mecha.""

Stacy froze. ""Seriously?""

""All I want to know,"" Eric pleaded, ""is if there's a *chance*!""

""The rocket limbs have had a few controlled burns,"" Gary explained. ""They all worked as expected. But we haven't actually tried to fly it yet.""

Eric smiled. ""Well, today's the day! Are you up for it?""

""We've never even taken it *outside*!"" Isabel protested. ""In *theory*, it should work. All our tests have come back positive. But it's never been tried in the field!""

Eric wrung his hands. ""I'm sorry to ask this of you, but our backs are really up against the wall!"" He looked more unnerved than any of them had seen before. ""And I'm not going to sugarcoat this; you'll all be risking your lives. But a lot more lives hang in the balance, not to mention the success of our entire company! This is our make-or-break moment!"" He hung his head. ""I can't ask you to take this chance. You have to *choose* to.""

No one spoke. Then Dwight piped up. ""Some day I'll be an old man in a rocking chair on a porch, and I'll look back at this time...and if I don't act now, that old man is going to regret it and kick himself.""

""Yeah!"" Stacy exhorted. ""Let's *do* this!""

Sam could hardly contain himself. ""Then...I've always wanted to say this...*mecha pilots, assemble*!""

Gary, Dwight, Stacy, and Irwin, cheering loudly, ran for the hangar, the others close behind.

Eric turned his head; the camera followed to watch them leave. ""God speed, my brain-trust warriors.""

""How much fuel do we have on board?"" Gary asked breathlessly.

""Five hundred and twenty pounds,"" Dwight replied, gasping for air. ""We haven't refueled since our last burn.""

""No time now! What's our battery charge?""

""They should be full,"" Isabel answered. ""I left it plugged in.""

They arrived in the hangar. The four pilots ran off to their respective flight decks. The rest attended to the remote monitoring and diagnostic stations. ""Big Daddy!"" Sam shouted into the microphone. ""We're taking out the flying mecha. Are all systems go?""

""I heard about the hijacking, and the plan,"" Big Daddy answered in his usual sedate manner. ""All systems are go. My confidence is high. I just wish there was time to add fuel.""

Isabel threw a knife switch to raise the hangar door, as the various parts of the mecha powered on. ""Oh, heck,"" she said suddenly, as she ran towards the mecha, which was flexing its joints, doing its final tests. ""It's still plugged in!"" she yelled. ""I need a minute!""

Gary's voice squelched over the radio link. ""Uh...Sam? How do we get this thing outside? It's too tall for the hangar door.""

Sam stared blankly. ""Um...not sure. We've never tried it before.""

Isabel finished yanking out the assortment of extension cords, then high-tailed it back to her workstation.

Stacy's voice piped up. ""I think we have to crawl.""

The mecha lowered itself to the ground, and clumsily put its hands on the ground. After a few false starts, it began crawling towards the hangar door, its pace quickening as the crew got the hang of it. ""You know what they say,"" Dwight quipped. ""You have to crawl before you can fly.""

They reached the taxiway outside the hangar; unfamiliar sunlight poured into the mecha's sensors. Quickly, it adjusted to the new inputs, and gave its pilots a clear picture of their surroundings. Their mission computers all bleeped; the intercom link surged with Sam's voice. ""OK, I've linked you to the radar tracking of the bogey. We've got ten minutes until it reaches the outskirts of the city, and fifteen minutes until it reaches Unlimited Partners central HQ.""

Gary pondered the trajectory as Dwight fired the rocket limbs, preparing them for flight. ""We should be able to intercept it at the city's edge...but we're going to have to use our full thrust. This is going to be *really* rough. Are you all willing?""

All pilots answered affirmatively. ""Then off we go!"" Gary cheered as he slid all four thrust-power sliders to their maximum. The mecha shuddered uncertainly, slowly lifting off the ground, then wavered a little bit. As all four limbs pointed themselves down, in the same direction, suddenly it began picking up speed. It took off into the morning sky, piercing through the morning fog and vanishing.

""Aaaaah! I can't do this!"" Irwin yelled. ""I feel like I'm being crushed!""

""One moment!"" Gary yelled. ""OK, your suit should be extra pressurized now. Any better?""

""This really hurts!"" Irwin continued to scream.

""Keep screaming!"" Stacy yelled. ""It'll help keep you from blacking out!""

""She's right!"" Dwight interjected. ""Scream, tense up all your muscles, and hold in your stomach! We'll have to deal with maximum G forces until we get there!""

Irwin continued to scream; Gary turned down the volume on his intercom. ""As long as we can still hear him, it means he's OK. Some prior training for G forces would have been really helpful, but it's too late now.""

""Is this right?"" Stacy interrupted. ""Only seven minutes to intercept?""

""Sure looks like it,"" Gary agreed. ""The rocket-limbs are working really well. We're burning an awful lot of fuel, though. It'll take four hundred pounds just to reach the intercept point. I just hope Irwin can take it. Irwin, you hanging in there?""

""Aaaaaaaaaugh!"" Irwin continued to scream. ""I love iiiiiiiit! There's nothing else I'd rather doooooooo!""

Dwight was unconvinced. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""As long as he's still screaming, he's alive,"" Gary joked.

""He's fine,"" Isabel radioed. ""His vital signs are all good. Keep doing what you're doing, Irwin!""

""Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" he continued to yell.

""Can you imagine what they must be thinking on the ground?"" Stacy wondered.

""The anime fans are probably having a religious experience,"" Gary offered. ""Assuming they can see us.""

""That brings up an important issue,"" Dwight pointed out. ""What happens when the *hijackers* see us?""

""That depends,"" Gary offered. ""Are they going to be looking for a giant flying robot?""

""Uh...hmmm...good point. We'll have to hope we surprise them.""

The mecha continued to fly across the sky, angling upwards, its rocket-limbs spewing white-hot flames twice as long as its body. The mission computers had calculated that, given their current trajectory, that at the intercept point, they'd be five hundred feet above the airliner. ""I believe we can drop on them from above,"" Gary suggested. ""I think that's our best plan.""

""It's getting hot in here,"" Stacy observed. ""How's our cooling system?""

""Not yet running at full,"" Gary answered. ""I can turn them up. We should have sufficient battery power. Isabel?""

""You sure do,"" Isabel assured. ""You were charged to the top when you left.""

""I think I'm finally getting the hang of this,"" Irwin suddenly added, sounding strained.

""Glad to hear it, buddy!"" Gary chimed. ""I'm going to need your fine motor skills when we move to intercept. You ready for this?""

""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" Irwin gushed.

""Just keep up your G-force countermeasures,"" Isabel reminded. ""You're doing good, but don't relax them.""

""Not a problem,"" Irwin assured. ""They've become second nature.""

The rockets dropped their power slightly; the flight computers had adjusted the autopilot for the intercept. Gliding over the river that formed the northern border of the city, the mecha started to rotate in the air. Gary's voice filled the intercom. ""Hold on to your stomachs, people. This is going to feel really weird. Try not to get airsick.""

The mecha pivoted in the air, and pointed its limbs down, allowing it to hover. It came to a stop.

""The airliner is thirty seconds away, and we're seven hundred feet above it,"" Gary announced.

""And they don't *see* us?"" Stacy sounded incredulous. ""Not even on radar?""

""I'm not picking up any radar from them,"" Dwight observed. ""They must be operating on visual flight rules. Not a surprise if they're amateurs. They're probably just fixated on their target. Fortunately for us.""

The aircraft finally became visible on their external cameras. ""I'm ready for the intercept thrust,"" Gary announced. ""Irwin, you ready to grapple?""

""I was *born* to do this!"" Irwin exulted.

Gary counted down. ""Six...five...four...three...two...one...BURN!""

The mecha's limbs flung themselves back, and its rockets fired. The external cameras showed the plane approach; a few seconds before impact, its limbs swung down again, to slow its descent. With a loud, resounding crunch, the mecha impacted with the airliner. Quickly, its arms dove under the wings, and its hands met on the plane's roof, near the first-class section, putting the plane into a full nelson. Its feet pushed backwards, finding their grip on each side of the tail wing. A few tense moments passed.

""We're not stopping them!"" Gary shouted frantically. ""They've turned up their engines, and we don't have the fuel to use ours to slow them down!""

There was a few moments of silence. ""Can we kick our legs, like we're on a swing?"" Stacy suggested. ""If we can point the airliner upward, maybe we can get control of it.""

Gary sounded unsure. ""Irwin? Do the arms have a good grip?""

Irwin sounded confident. ""They're not going *anywhere*. Start kicking!""

The mecha's feet pulled themselves from the tail wings and began bucking wildly. Slowly, the airliner began to pitch upwards.

""I wonder what *this* looks like on the ground,"" Stacy asked sardonically.

Sam's voice, over the radio, feigned embarrassment. ""Um, well, when an airplane and a giant robot love each other *very* much...""

""It's working!"" Irwin suddenly exclaimed. ""Stop kicking! The airplane is in an aerodynamic stall. Its engines aren't enough to keep it in the air. Just a little bit of thrust from our legs, and we should be able to bring this unholy union to the ground!""

The mecha and airplane, locked in their hostile embrace, continued to plummet downwards.

""Why do you think the airliner hasn't cut its engines?"" Dwight asked. ""That would make our job a lot more difficult.""

""Maybe they didn't think of it,"" Gary suggested. ""We jolted them pretty hard when we hit; maybe they're unconscious.""

""Or maybe they're just panicking,"" Stacy wryly observed.

""Let's just hope our luck doesn't run out!"" Gary added. ""I think I can guide us to that empty field near the interstate. I'll try to slow down before we hit, but I can't guarantee anything. We're getting dangerously low on fuel. Brace for impact!""

On the ground, traffic on the interstate had come to a halt. People had left their cars to gawk at the garishly-colored spectacle plummeting towards them. As the airliner's jet engines continued to strain against its captor, the mecha fired its rockets in a finely-coordinated pattern, trying to steer them to the grassy plain, one of the few areas nearby that wasn't either trees or buildings. A few moments before reaching the ground, the mecha's leg-rockets suddenly flared brightly, slowing their descent and starting a few small brush fires. With a surprisingly gentle crushing noise, the airliner landed on the ground, the mecha still firmly attached to its top.

They continued to slide along the ground. ""Their engines are still firing! If we don't stop them, they'll drag us both into the river!""

""How about if I pinch their engines?"" Irwin offered. ""I'll have to let go with the arms, but I should be able to do this.""

""I think that's our best bet,"" Gary agreed. ""Do it!""

The mecha's arms let go. Quickly, it slid down the length of the airliner, but suddenly, the legs grappled the aircraft's sides, stopping its motion. Now in position, the arms reached towards the engines and crushed them with its hands. Jet fuel sprayed from the wounded turbines as the airliner and its giant passenger slid along the ground for several hundred more feet, finally coming to a stop.

The external microphones picked up a buzzing sound, growing louder. ""Where did the drones come from?"" Stacy asked. ""The highway?""

""That's it!"" Gary suddenly interjected. ""Irwin, rip the roof off of the flight deck! Let the drones take care of the hijackers!""

""You got it!"" The mecha shimmied up the length of the airliner; when it got near the front, its giant hands dug its fingers under the sides, peeling the roof back like a giant sardine can. Four hijackers stood in the exposed flight deck, gaping upwards in sheer terror. Quickly, the drones swarmed them; a few precisely-fired taser bolts later, and they all collapsed to the ground.

""YOU DID IT!"" a voice on the radio yelled. More cheering could be heard in the background. Stacy reacted with surprise. ""Wait, was that Eric Thompson?""

""It's me, and everyone else at headquarters!"" Eric answered. ""Plus several million more viewers on TV.""

""Wow,"" Stacy stammered. ""Way to bury the lede there, boss.""

""Are you kidding?"" Eric gushed. ""We wouldn't have missed this for the world!""

""Uh..."" Irwin began. ""Glad to be of service?""

The external microphones now picked up the cheers of the passengers. The emergency doors had opened, the exit chutes had inflated, and passengers were sliding out of the stricken aircraft as quickly as they could. Most of them gawked at the giant robot, which continued to sit astride the airplane, like a brightly-colored cowboy on a white horse. A few had run off, to stamp out the small brush fires caused by the mecha's rockets.

The external cameras showed the highway, the passengers having left their cars en masse. All were cheering and clapping.

""Did we actually live through that?"" Irwin's voice gasped weakly. ""The adrenaline is wearing off. I think I'm going to lose it.""

""Permission to lose it granted,"" Sam jokingly intoned. ""You've all done a great job.""

""You know what would be awesome?"" Dwight piped up. ""We should fly away from here, back to base, and salute in the air for everyone on the highway.""

""Not going to happen,"" Isabel related over the radio. ""You only have thirty pounds of fuel left.""

""Can we siphon anything from the airliner?"" Stacy asked.

Isabel paused for a moment. ""You don't have anything to siphon with,"" she sighed. ""We never thought to add such an attachment.""

""Then what do we do?"" Dwight pined. ""We can't just lay here and wait for a big flatbed to pick us up. That'd be embarrassing!""

""There's a truck stop about two miles down the highway,"" Sam offered. ""Diesel fuel is close enough to aircraft fuel for the mecha's systems. And between your remaining battery power, and the internal generators, you have enough power to..."" Sam paused for a moment. ""To walk there.""

""Well, I guess that'll still look pretty cool,"" Dwight agreed reluctantly. ""But not what I was hoping for.""

Gary's voice crackled over the mecha's loudspeakers. ""Citizens, please give me some space. I need to leave."" The passengers obediently formed a wide circle around the mecha. Slowly, it moved to stand up and dismount the airliner, to the cheers of everyone nearby. Unsteadily, the mecha walked towards the highway; the circle of people parted to let them through.

""Blast off! Blast off!"" the kids yelled, picked up by the external microphones. ""See, I knew they'd want that,"" Dwight sighed. ""We need to plan better in the future.""

Gary's voice once again blared from the loudspeaker. ""Sorry, kids. Not enough fuel. But maybe next time!"" All four pilots could hear their disappointed whines. Gary continued. ""Hey, c'mon, kids! I'm still a giant flying robot!"" The kids quickly began cheering again. The mecha slowly, clumsily walked away.

""OK, I think our autopilot can handle this,"" Gary declared. ""Just watch for sinkholes or loose soil.""

As they neared the highway, the disembarked passengers continued to cheer and clap. The mecha stopped and stood there. The loudspeaker crackled once again with Gary's voice. ""Citizens, please move your vehicles. I have to get home."" They finally stopped cheering, went back into their cars, and got out of the way. The mecha crawled up the embankment, walked across the lanes of traffic, and began trudging down the highway in the slow lane. Cars slowly drove past it, horns honking and passengers whooping, before driving off. The mecha occasionally saluted, to even louder cheers.

The customers at the truck stop could hear the rhythmic clanking noise from quite some distance away. As the mecha approached, most of them just stood and stared, their mouths gaping. The mecha walked into the parking lot, picked a row of interior pumps, and stood there, waiting. The loudspeaker flared again. ""Don't mind me, citizens. I just need fuel. I'll wait in line.""

The two truckers that were next in line made several animated arm gestures, then each got into their trucks, started them up, and moved to back up. The mecha backed up too, getting out of their way. Deftly, the trucks slithered past each side of the mecha, smoothly arriving back in their lanes. ""Thank you, citizens!"" the loudspeaker blared.

Slowly, the mecha lowered itself onto its hands and knees. From there, it shifted to a prone position, and began to army-crawl between the rows of gas pumps. The clanking and scraping made a ferocious noise that caused many onlookers to cover their ears. Finally, the mecha was in position, and the steady hum of its power shut down, leaving behind a ghostly silence.

A few moments passed. Then the sides of each limb opened up, and the pilots exited, lowering themselves gingerly to the ground. As the onlookers continued to gawk, the pilots nonchalantly pulled out their company credit cards, swiped them at the pumps, then each removed a gas cap and put the diesel spouts into the exposed fuel filler.

The trucker opposite Dwight stammered. ""Uh...er...um...what kind of mileage do you get in that thing?""

""I'm not sure,"" Dwight answered. ""We just burned about five hundred pounds; that got us a total of about fifteen miles. We used a lot less fuel during free-fall, though.""

""Free-fall?"" the trucker replied weakly. ""Buddy, you must have horseshoes in *both* pockets.""

A few families had crowded around Irwin. ""How do you become a giant-robot pilot?"" one kid asked.

""First, you have to invent it,"" Irwin answered. ""I'm part of the team that built this. We have two more back at our lab.""

""Do they fly too?"" The kid's eyes burned with adoration.

""Not yet, but after today, I'm sure we'll add it soon!"" The kid looked disappointed. Irwin continued. ""But...you know what they *can* do? Kung fu battle! Just like in the movies!"" The kid gaped wordlessly.

""What company do you work for?"" a man asked. ""Who is in the giant-robot business?""

""I'm with a research-and-development division of Unlimited Partners,"" Irwin answered. ""And we do a lot more than just giant robots.""

""Well, I'm sure glad you do!"" the man exulted. ""That was fine work, stopping that hijacking. Can you believe the government hasn't even released a statement on it? I think they're too humiliated.""

""I haven't had time to catch up on the news,"" Irwin explained. ""I'm sure I will...once I fly back to the office.""

""That's right, ladies — you *too* can become a giant-robot pilot!"" Stacy happily explained to a throng of Girl Scouts, hanging on her every word. ""And I don't just fly it; I helped *design* and *build* it! But you'll need to stay in school, study hard, and keep out of trouble! Jobs like these only go to the best! And *you* can make it this far, if you just apply yourselves!""

""We will!"" they cheered as they ran off to get back in their vans.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that,"" the den mother told Stacy.

""No problem, I get it,"" Stacy answered. ""I know the Girl Scouts are for at-risk children. Hopefully they stay inspired.""

The den mother glanced at the mecha, her eyes filled with wonder. ""If *that* doesn't inspire them...*nothing* will.""

A thin, gangly man in business-casual left the shop and approached Gary, a stunned look on his face. Gary turned and smiled. ""Are you the manager?"" He tried to answer, but couldn't find his voice; finally, he just nodded vigorously.

""What's the pre-authorization limit on these pumps?"" Gary asked nonchalantly.

""Uh...ummm...seventy five gallons,"" the manager stammered.

""Can we all get authorized for about a thousand gallons each? We have a long flight home.""

""I...um...yes. I'll...go do...that."" The manager walked off, looking behind him one last time before disappearing inside the shop.

As the mecha continued to fuel, Dwight walked up to Stacy. ""So...before the next time...*rubber shoes*.""

Stacy laughed. ""I know, right? I though the *flight* was bad...the walk was easily *twice* as bad! I think my bones are still shaking.""

""And rubber knee pads and elbow pads, too.""

""Yeah...I'm not looking forward to fixing all those scrapes. But can you imagine it? The mecha will look like a roller-derby player! How awesome would *that* be?"" Stacy looked at the mecha, grinning impishly. ""How about retractable inline skates? The *heck* with all this walking!""

""Oh yeah, huh?"" Dwight agreed. ""I guess there are some ideas that don't occur to you unless you try the thing in the real world."" Dwight looked at the mecha's back. ""And why the heck don't we have a giant flaming sword?""

The four pilots continued to field questions, and receive congratulations, as the pumps slowly filled up the mecha. Finally, they put the spouts back, replaced the gas caps, and climbed back inside their respective flight decks, giving the crowds one last thumb's up before disappearing inside, to the din of their hails and cheers.

The mecha powered up, its electric hum making the air shake. This brought on another round of applause and whooping. It slowly army-crawled from under the canopy, back to unobstructed space. The metallic screeching and scraping sound silenced the crowd quickly as they covered their ears and winced.

""*Oh* my God,"" Irwin began. ""I haven't dealt with so much of the public in my *life*!""

""I heard *that*!"" Stacy added. ""This was fun once, but if there are any more public appearances, I think we need to use gregarious pilot types. I thought the *battle* was tough...having to deal with people was *much* more draining!""

""Hey Gary, once we're out, can we launch with only three of the rockets?"" Dwight asked. ""I really want to try a salute as we leave.""

""I think that'll be safe,"" Gary answered. ""But don't try anything fancy. Just one salute and we're done.""

""Not a problem,"" Dwight laughed. ""I'm willing to start small.""

The mecha walked to the far end of the complex's parking lot, away from the people, trucks, and anything flammable. After turning to face the crowd, its leg rockets ignited, along with one arm. As the mecha launched into the sky, its free arm moved to salute, before dropping that arm down and firing the last rocket. The exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but the rockets made too much noise to hear them.

The flight back to their airport was uneventful and leisurely. There was no need to use full rocket power; all the pilots had had enough of high G forces for one day.

The mecha neared the airport. The exterior cameras showed that huge crowds had formed on either side of the runway. The radio suddenly crackled to life. ""Welcome back, robo-nauts!"" Eric Thompson's voice gushed. ""You're all heroes!""

""Oh, man,"" Gary answered. ""I hope you don't expect us to deal with any more people. All we want to do is collapse."" The mecha moved to land upright.

""Not a problem,"" Eric assured them. ""You just need to land and crawl back inside. We'll deal with the press.""

""Thanks, boss,"" Gary replied, with great relief in his voice. ""The truck stop was agonizing, but we didn't know what else to do."" The mecha landed gently on the ground; the exterior cameras showed the crowd cheering wildly, but they couldn't be heard over the roar of the rockets.

""I understand completely,"" Eric commiserated. ""And rest assured, you all get the rest of the day off. Well, after a full medical exam. We want to make sure you're intact.""

The mecha got down on its hands and knees. ""So do we,"" Gary agreed. ""We're just glad to have survived.""

""So am I,"" Eric answered sanguinely. ""And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about the reaction. Lots of nonpublic stuff. You all did more good today than you can possibly imagine.""

The mecha crawled through the hangar door. ""That's fine...but *tomorrow*. We need a break.""

""You've earned it,"" Eric agreed. ""Have a good evening.""

The hangar door closed behind the mecha, the loud clang reverberating across the runway."
"Top signs we're living in a cyberpunk futureTo go along with everyone else's ""Wait, did the world become cyberpunk and I didn't notice?"" I should point out the following facts:

For example: They fixed the California elections to put a action movie star in as governor while simultaneously shutting down half the state's power plants to create an artificial energy shortage. This while they were bankrupt from hiding all of their losses for a decade. That's some Shadowrun stuff right there.

6. The governments bailed out all the megacorps for gross financial stupidity.

7. The world's largest mercenary company, G4, does a large number of the West's prison system as well as corporate security.

18. The working class pay 95% of all taxes versus 5% by corporations when it was reversed in the Forties.

19. It's possible to buy a carbon fiber katana over the internet. Ditto mirror shades and a bullet proof trench coat--all shipped to you overnight.

20. The police now have Special Forces units in every city and many places have them driving APCs as well as tanks.

21. Social media resulted in spontaneous revolutions in several Arab countries. The crackdowns were pretty damn awful to say the least.

22. Virtual Reality is a thing with actual games being shipped for it.

23. Mass data mining occurs just to find out what you would buy from a online store and why.

24. Amazon has sold dumb AI for your house and Microsoft has done the same for your computer.

25. China is now the predominate economic power in the world due to how much leverage it has over the United States.

26. The Soviet Union may have fallen but we're back to Russians making sinister plans to take over the world, only now with computer hackers.

28. The world's largest environmental disaster was paid for in fines which left the oil company fine.

29. It's impossible to tax most trans-national corporations due to their multinational nature.

30. Criminal syndicates with ties to terrorism have forced governments to treat with them.

31. Global warming has reached the point of ""so obvious it's flooding cities"" while corporations still foster people denying it.

32. Countries have places where there's not enough to eat or a central government but citizens possess Ipods.

33. A wetworks black ops against Iran's nuclear program was conducted entirely by hackers.

34. People have died playing video games because they didn't stop long enough to pee.

35. North Korea may have attacked America's movie industry with computer sabotage.

36. The fact mercenary-for-hire criminal hackers is an actual profession. They even have names based on what kind of hat they wear.

37. The fact artificial worlds people live much of their lives in are common pastimes online now.

38. The fact some postage is now being delivered by flying robots.

39. The fact individuals are still trying to make artificial islands to be lawless tax-free corporate states. Double points that these invariably become scams to bilk investors.

40. All of this is actually right on time for 2020."
"How do I start a more serious Cyberpunk sub?Almost everything in cyberpunk is either laid out or coming to pass and it's harder and harder not to acknowledge it now. The overlap between Boring Dystopia, Robotics, Prosthetics, 3d Printing, Coding, Conspiracy, Political and Economic issues means that it's been here for a while. If you look at the Cybergoth and Punk trends mixed with things like Anonymous and the maker scene you could also argue for some of the aesthetics as well creeping into the landscape.  


I think it was a neat place to visit with great art , not a road map though and I for one actually hate the way it feels when applied in real life. What once was a fantasy is now becoming a harsh reality for those of us who are aware of it. So if we know what to look for in the fiction, how do we actually cope with the reality of it? I want to see more posts on reddit applying less cosplay and toy applications and more on useful things like actual scripting for things, robotics, and news coverage.   


Is there a way to make a thread for CyberpunkPol or CyberpunkNews? If so I'd like to apply to create or become a moderator for it but don't know where to start. I know that most of this sub is largely aesthetics, so I would like to help by offering another alternative for people who want to post about things relating to the practical side of it to keep this sub reddit more lighthearted. Maybe even offer to redirect some of those posts to the other site I want to create to keep this one what it was meant to be. That way people who would like to contribute posts that are more news oriented or slightly political have an alternative way to do so without ruining the vibe here.  


If something like this already exists, please let me know the right name for it so I can contribute, but otherwise I would like to add to or even run the project. I used to have a more cyberpunk oriented conspiracy and news blog on another site but I don't know the rules on posting links if that would be appropriate so if anyone would like to see it in the comments let me know."
"CYBERPUNK IS DEAD — LONG LIVE CYBERPUNKI have some time between renders/contracts, so I'm committing some ponders to pixels.

Over the last few months I've noticed an uptick in ""this isn't cyberpunk"" posts on this forum. And as far as r/outrun, r/cyberpunk_music, r/blackmirror and other longtail, future-minded communities are concerned, this sentiment seems to be collecting momentum. More gatekeeping. More ""this isn't that"" for whichever reason. But these comments always attract downvotes and criticism, generally sinking beneath even a glancing relevance on a controversial sort-by.

But I couldn't help but notice a raw truth to those bitter outliers—and take a chance to pat myself down for biases and misconceptions. I'll confess to feeling like I have roomaji tanlines from the neon in here.

These days I look on Cyberpunk and Outrun and the like for inspiration, but they've got some pretty disenchanting criteria for successful content. You know what I'm going to say: [neon. Korean/Kanji slogans. High-tech/low-life juxtaposition. Rain.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8ve6w3/midnight_city/) [Brutalist architecture interrupted by glowing lines and imposing advertisements](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/011/595/818/large/alizee-zucconi-red-sunset.jpg). Femme fatales with augmentations. That [fucking Ferrari](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/30qo98/ferrari_512_s_modulo_concept_1970/) you've never heard about but you see constantly. Pick two—or [just one](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/011/565/004/large/pavel-zolotarev-mm.jpg?1530217828) if the picture is nice. Upvotes and the community's tacit approval orbit the most pleasing, but not particularly challenging, images.

Isn't there more to this? Cyberpunk is so deep. Right?

But I think we're misinterpreting top posts as examples of the form and its ideals; cream rises to the top, but it doesn't tell you what milk is. And in turn, I think we're expecting too much from the format. Statistically speaking, forums don't encourage more than a moment's scrutiny on a piece of content, and nothing more nuanced than a binary verdict. And they don't represent anything but the lion's share of the public's foveal grace on the morning commute. Vote yes for Robot Breasts, 2084. They speak to me.

But that's just Reddit, I guess.

The meat of my point is that cyberpunk is approaching a saturation point in the popular media as well. I spend my time over at r/BlackMirror observing people pick apart Brooker's concepts as if they were Brave New warnings of a time to come, but we know he's standing on [Gibson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer)/[Bester's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stars_My_Destination)/[Butler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon) shoulders. And though the concepts of a reckless, unregulated and mechanized future, of thought control and churning social norms aren't new, they've never been so *in-vogue* before. They've never been so likely to tire people who turn away from the Russia-US cyberconflict to relax in glamorized versions of the same fears.

And I can't help but feel that the ""punk"" suffix of our heritage has been long banished to the sleepwalking protest that is the errant troll or monosyllabic gatekeeper. When beloved content is threatened with a preponderance of new consumers, the vanguard and devoted brace themselves for an ""adjustment"" of the target audience. And I'm afraid that we're far past the [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) of cyberpunk.

Cyberpunk is drowning in the mainstream.

But I'm not here to write the antediluvian stretch of a contemporary dystopian memoir gospel. And I doubt I'd be able to gather enough disciples for a following. But I feel like we're all trying to say the same thing in our boredom and criticism. What was ours is now theirs, and they have become us, and we will never be the same.

And maybe, to most people, it never was about much more than neon and Japanese script. And finely crafted robotic women who can't feel sad, but you can feel them. And nerds winning. And replacing our failing forms with something more metal and menacing. And holding out for a future where pressing your pleasure button is as easy as buying the button.

If anyone can remember who ""we"" are, and what ""being"" is, I'd appreciate your thoughts and reactions. Like and subscribe."
"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking.

“Okay.”"
"I'm making a game in a cyberpunk setting, I'm looking for feedback on the setting and if my characters are not too unrealistic for your tasteHi,

I'm making a new game. It's going to be a 2D game with sprites, in a semi-3D world. Think about Stardew Valley and the older Zelda games, but a lot more visual effects. Most of the art will be relatively small, because the character sprites are within 64x64 pixels. So it helps if my characters look a bit more unique and complex, so it's easier to distinct their sprites.

&#x200B;

Now one of my ideas is to make some anthropomorphic animal characters. Not in a silly way, but semi-realistic. Like some humans could be edited and born with the head of a tiger. Or gorilla arms or whatever. This could have multiple reasons in the story. Maybe they like the aesthetic or it's because they will be strong and can fight better or help in mines.

&#x200B;

The real reason is so that it will be easier to create visually interesting character sprites. But I can also see some people will dislike the idea and not play the game as it's a bit too much fantasy for cyberpunk.

&#x200B;

I guess another option would be to go a bit more crazy on prosthetic designs. Maybe they replaced parts of their body to look more like a robot and then be creative and have unique designs in that way. I know getting creative character designs in a cyberpunk setting shouldn't be too hard, but the small size of the character sprites is the real problem. As clothes themselves lack a lot of detail, I should try to make their body designs unique.

&#x200B;

So my main question is: would your interest in the game reduce, if there were these characters with animal features in a cyberpunk setting? I know another game that's similar is Beyond Good and Evil and a lot people did not buy that game because of the anthropomorphic characters.

So although the characters might look cool or interesting, I think many people will prefer a more realistic approach. So any feedback would be really appreciated :)"

Knightscope Security Bot annoyed it was asked to do its job. Not the onion [https://gizmodo.com/useless-police-robot-fails-to-call-for-help-when-needed-1838886285](https://gizmodo.com/useless-police-robot-fails-to-call-for-help-when-needed-1838886285)
"Aesthetics and their relationship to cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk/cyberprepI love the retrofuturistic 80's aesthetic of cyberpunk fiction. 

I love this genre of sci-fi because I feel like it has interesting things to say. 

I can't help feeling though, that many of the tropes and aesthetics of the genre can be limiting, which is why I'm intrigued by post-cyberpunk. Black Mirror might be an example of post-cyberpunk. 

Anyways, what do you guys think? Are we limiting ourselves because of nostalgia? That's kind of a weird concept for sci-fi, right?"
"(New) Cyberpunk/SciFi Novel - PsyTekA weighty, biting, cold just sort of... hung there, freely of its own accord, occupying the empty void ahead, somehow threatening its surrounding space with the expectation and gravitas of tangible existence, despite not possessing the title itself.

I imagine not unlike how Death must have. Perched high, her wings' recently ruffled visage, kept pulled back, obscuring any hint of trepidation she may feel from all but the most astutely observant. There she perched, still, stuck, unseen, in a world where she has no purpose.

So she waited…,

…and watched.

New Chicago had been unusually cool that Monday morning, even with it still being so early in the year, just March thirteenth, after all. Even for the mostly digitally-lit exterior walls of the building, any hint of actual sunlight just barely was able to scratch through a few small gaps between some of the towering structures, the shortest of which still reaching over twenty-thousand feet high. It was notably cooler that morning, though, despite even considering all of that.

On nearly any Monday, or— essentially any day…, as long as it includes the last 200 years

the last 200 years or so, she, like every single other day of the week, remained perched, still... and waited....and waited. She waited, patiently, while PsyTek, over the course of that time, singlehandedly and systematically replaced, the entire institution of corporations, municipalities, and eventually, city and state governmental bodies that essentially made up what was the previous world, before developing into what it is now, modern-day, 2547 PsyTek™

She continued to watch, and witnessing as the delicate system of greed that once moved the world's machine along almost effortlessly, fell, piece by piece, one by one, dominos, unable to support the weight of its prior, unable to stop its own self-destruction once started.

Pharmaceutical companies failed first, as PsyTek's Division 1 supplanted the previous excuse for medical care with a solution that actually helped the public.

Next out was oil and public transport, the responsibilities for which, later transitioned over to fall PsyTek responsibility. Once Division 2 was founded in April of 2360, modes of transport were suddenly provided to civilians that were previously limited or had none, prior.

Research into new technologies didn't take long to leave us without any need for fossil fuels for any reason.

And...While distant oil kingdoms collapsed, she remained, perched, waiting.along with any financial and political support with it.

As perpetual war, and drugs, (and ironically, the war on drugs), the previous world was left were the fuel of the prior global economy, now foreign to many, as more and more civilians join PsyTek's cause, war was found left without an enemy. War always follows oil, and without the financial and political backing, no one was ready to start a conflict As heavy a cost as war carries, financially, and historically, with people, found themselves struggling to finance wars, much less the soldiers in it. As a result,

She watched, still, as failed war income quickly led to global economic collapse of the world that had been. She watched, still, as war and selling a treatment-over-cure could no longer support, or provide the cushion the company needed to keep enough stock to sell overpriced goods to their own underpaid employees. as they gave the world a global cure of nearly every known disease and sickness, began to feed the hungry, and house the homeless.

She watched an old-world fade into nonexistence, replaced with a perfect society, where they even learned ways to even temper violence within oneself, not with punishment, but with compassion, and eventually even managing to... ""cure death itself"" ™.

That one always made her wince.

It was salt in an already raw wound-turned marketing campaign. The slogan became a persistent reminder of her inability to perform the simple task she was assigned. Really, they just temporarily avoided her, at best. Like stopping a clock. Limbs can be regrown, cancer removed as if it were a mole, even aging can be reversed through a simple, free, cellular regeneration process, and a quick fifteen-minute trip to the clinic.

But on that particularly cold morning... Death stirred. She woke up, as a girl with black hair, smoking a clove cigarette passed underneath. For the first time in over 200 years, the task given by her brother had meaning. She's been waiting for a long time...

&#x200B;

\-- But this isn't death's story. No.

\-- This story belongs to the girl with dark hair, smoking a clove, and how she learns the truth. The girl who rose Death from her slumber.  


&#x200B;

\-- -- -- -- Present Day New Chicago -- -- -- -- -- --

24-year-old, soon-to-be Tek, Kay LeBlanc, is a persistently sarcastic interface designer at InMind Designs, who... also sort of happens to occasionally hear voices when she gets stressed.

Tyler Warren, head of PsyTek’s Division 5, just took a personal interest in her after seeing her deliver an impressive presentation. The problem is, from the moment he, and PsyTek, show up, life, she finds her world haunted by visions of darkness filled with the sound of screams.

The opportunity is once-in-a-lifetime, though, and she can’t pass it up. From the moment she starts her new life, however, she learns there’s a lot more to her world than anyone had ever thought.

Every perfect world has a cost, and as she learns what that cost is, who, and more importantly what, she is, becomes clear

\* \* \* \* || Hi guys! - Melanie, author of PsyTek here! || \* \* \* \*

So I was digging around Reddit the other night, bored, like ya' do, and came across (because for some reason I hadn't before now \*is dumb\* \^\_\^\`) this amazing community of Cyberpunk fans, and thought to myself—

""Self,"" I said, “This would be the absolutely perfect group of unique characters to share my recently debuted novel with!”(with approval from the mods, of course! Ty [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/) mods <3 <3 )

It's the first novel of what will be *at least* a 3-part series, minimum, Additionally, there are plans for at least 2 specific character origin story one-off novels.

Everyone who has read it so far has loved it, the only complaint so far is asking where's the second book!

I know you guys will be my most critical(and I appreciate you for that! <3 )but also... if I did it JUST right...I think (or hope, at the very least!) that you guys will enjoy it probably more than any regular plain-old non-belonging-in-the-future tie-wearing office worker.(Nothing against those guys-- you should read it too! \^\_\^\` lol)

But-- this being [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/) <3I want to do something SPECIAL for you all,

if you're interested! Since it's my new debut novel, I know it's not likely you've read it yet, so--

I'd love to hear any questions or thoughts about the book that might help bring you into the world of PsyTek, or just spark a new interest that hadn't quite hit flashpoint before?(I escape there, often, in my mind O.O)But; Ask me about the world, the tech, the progress, whatever you'd like.The world of PsyTek is VERY extensively built in my head, spanning millennia, with some very rich and interesting characters.

You can even ask me about me! I might even answer it! \^\_\^\`(in reality, I probably will answer, and then you'll all ask me to stop sharing)

:-p

Also, I'd like to add a specific note-- I wrote the Synopsis completely new, for [r/Cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/). I wanted to give a special little interesting side story, as a special gift to a community I love <3 That being said....SOME (\*most\*) of it MAY (\*was definitely\*) written after 3 days awake.I delayed posting to keep tweaking the ""Synopsis"" community story repeatedly because I want to share quality content and stories, so. If there's something off, obvious typo, etc.. probably because of 3 days awake(/#onlyslightlydelerious). Sorry!!

"I wrote a cyberpunk story for a writing class. Thought I'd share it with you guys. [1,000 words]The Justicar jolted to life, like a refrigerator breaking its idle state, before leaving its docking spot. This was Calen’s cue that the damn thing was answering a radio request. He followed the robot as it made its way down the train. Mag-lev, he corrected himself. Trains were only a fragment of his dad’s old stories.

He rode the mag-lev from end to end, preying on moments just like this. It was time to earn a living. The commotion in the third car promised Calen a few more chits for his ultimate fund. Hopefully, a suppressing was in order.

He didn’t mean that in a bad way, however. Seeing people go through entire phases of suppression just breaks his heart, and he wouldn’t wish that upon his worst enemies. It does take its toll on the psyche sometimes, knowing that this was his only way of earning a living at the moment.

It gives him so much satisfaction seeing people benefit from the pain blockers, even if they call him an extortionist or a cheat along the way. Surely, it beats seeing his fellow people suffering the maximum pain a human body was designed to endure.

“Leave me alone, you fuckin’ tinheads!” said a scruffy man, his shoulder length hair swaying across his face as he turned from one Justicar to the other. “I shouldn’t be paying no fuckin’ full price for a ride. I have worker’s status, just like everyone else!”

These early-model Justicars weren’t as advanced as their modern counterparts. What was once the main force of policing has today become relegated to gutter work—small infractions and low-priority areas. Every time one of these things spoke, it seemed to take most of its processing power. “Please provide Wristjack for inspection,” it said.

“Good. That’s right. Run the damn thing so you pieces of shit can leave me alone.” The stranger stuck out his wrist.

The Justicar whirred, extended its metal hand, and whipped out a wand, a flood of green light shining wherever it waved. It was shaped like a wand, but to Calen’s eyes, these things were just interchangeable fingers the Justicars had in their fists. The Justicar pointed the green light at the stranger’s wrist, then whirred once more.

“Worker status... terminated. Tier-two infraction incurred. Penalty... suppression.”

The stranger’s eyes widened, framed by the hair stuck to his sweaty forehead and cheeks. “N-no. T-they said my pass would still be valid for the day! Termination’s not official till I get home! I’m still a worker!” He yanked his hand from the Justicar, staggering backwards from his effort.

“Please cooperate... or harsher measures will be implemented.”

“No please! It’s Cycorp’s fault! Check their systems, they would know! They *should* know! O-or run the scan again!”

A tier-two infraction for just a little misdemeanour? Calen welcomed money in the bank, but this seemed a little much. Someone should look into reprogramming these tinheads. Slum-workers were still human after all.

“Please, no. I’ll pay. I’ll get the money. I’ll get it by the end of the week, please.”

“Your cooperation will be appreciated. This is your second warning.”

“C-c’mon. There’s no need for—ow!”

Another wand, with a syringe extension this time, jabbed at the stranger’s Wristjack. A brief hiss punctuated the silence in the cabin. Those who haven’t left the car initially were now starting evacuate. The stranger screamed, the squeals of the mag-lev providing an oddly apt backing track.

The syringe retracted to the hand it came out of, after which the Justicar backed up and wheeled away, leaving the stranger to whimper on the floor. He’s going to have a long two days ahead of him—right after the pain kicks in tonight.

The man crouched, his fists tight, himself on the verge of hyperventilation.

“I can help you.”

The stranger turned around with a start.

Calen nodded at the man’s Wristjack. “I can help you with that.”

A sneer. Somehow, he still managed a sneer. “Whaddaya want?”

“Three chits.”

“You’re crazy. You’re all fuckin’ crazy. Three chits? I’ll sit through the entire suppression before I give you three fuckin’ chits.”

It was easy to tell how much to charge someone. First-time offenders paid the most, because they’ve never felt the pain of a suppression before. Had he been a repeat offender, he would’ve bargained at the sight of a dealer.

This guy didn’t know it yet, but he’d help Calen get a few chits closer to his goal. He fished around in his jacket and produced a black card.

“For when you need me.”

“You even want me to pay for a cryptocall? Huh. What do you take me for? Hey, asshole! Where you going?”

Calen left the cabin and returned to blend into the rest of the crowd. He wasn’t proud, making a living out of other people’s pain, but it was something he had to do, at least until he bought a new EMP slug. Then he’d go back to the big leagues.

He had a taste of major pharmaceutical runs once, until he had spent his last slug on Darlene. Calen still had no clue if it was the best decision he’s made. He hasn’t seen her since. It wouldn’t be half bad if she didn’t want to talk to him. But he’d be devastated if she *couldn’t*.

The only way to know for sure was to head on to New Central and see if he could find her again. Getting there would mean money. Lots of it. And the only way to get that much money was through setting foot in the big leagues again.

The mag-lev jerked to a halt and Calen got off at the stop. He walked through the tunnels, the metallic smells a stark reminder of where he was—the underbelly of the Sprawl. Surrounded by more tinheads than humans. Maybe he should just move on. Forget about Darlene. Maybe getting to New Central was a terrible idea.

His Wristjack vibrated. Those thoughts would have to wait. Right now, he had another potential victim—or client, whichever way you wanna put it—just three blocks away. A few chits at a time would have to do for now."
"Hey /r/Cyberpunk - I'm a philosophy student who's doing a presentation on Cyberpunk: I'd like your opinion on which of these appeal more to the Cyberpunk themeHi, /r/Cyberpunk!

This is my first time posting here (love the subreddit theme, nice work), so I hope I'm not going against any rules by posting this.

To cut a long story short, I'm a Philosophy student who's currently studying a course on Cyberculture, and for my presentation I decided to opt for the theme of Cyberpunk, because, well, I love the whole theme in general. 

I'm focusing on revolving my presentation around a film media as an example, however, I'm slightly torn between two motion pictures; both of which are centred around Cyberpunk. 

**Please bear in mind**, this isn't a ""Do my presentation for me"" post: it's more of a *""Help me choose between these two""*, since, whilst loving the theme, I'm not entirely certain on some aspects of the matter that could yield enough discussion when actually presenting.

So the two cards on the table are the film *I, Robot* and the current trending TV series, *Mr. Robot*. I've seen both film and (need to catch up on) TV series, so I already have an idea on the whole High Tech, Low Life concept. The entire Hacker's Ethic also comes into play in *Mr. Robot*, so it's a good thing to talk about, even when it's a modern cyberpunk and not futuristic - but then you have the whole Cyberpunk dystopia and anti-totalitarianism (correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't seen the film in a while) in *I, Robot*. The only thing that's tearing me apart is that I'm very aware that *I, Robot* was probably not the best adaptation, as I've seen through this subreddit that many people find it to be an insult to Asimov's work, and, as simple as it would be to just revolve a presentation around his novels or other works, I'd be more comfortable on focusing on the aforementioned media.

To wrap it up, which of the two appeals more to Cyberpunk to you? I'm torn between the two (and yes, it could just be easier to ask my lecturer for guidance, but hey, it's always nice to hear something from a larger crowd (plus, doubt he's seen *Mr. Robot*)), so once I settle down with either one of them, I look forward to writing this presentation out.

Thanks a bunch!"
"Let's Talk ""Ex Machina""...Ok, so first, this is not supposed to be a 'review post'
 
I was not originally even going to post all this anywhere except imdb/amazon.
but after reading some other reviews and some of they had some interesting opinions, not just ""this movie sucks"" / ""this it the best sci-fi movie ever made""
 
but on the content it's self. I've heard some people say ""this will change the way you look at scifi movies"" and others say it's ""sexpotative"", and they had some interesting reasoning backing their points.
 
 
so what I'm looking to do is create a more organized discussion of the content of the move, not necessarily if it's good or bad. 
 
 
Full disclosure, I was not much of a fan of this movie,
I did not think it was bad, just not great. now moving on the the discussion part:
  

 -------------
 
   
I've have to strongly disagree with the idea that this movie is any way 'ground breaking' in the story telling department, while it's much better then some of the other cyberpunk style movies we've been getting recently from Hollywood, like 'transcendence' I can't help but feel like they had some great concepts that they feel they spend a lot more time bringing up concepts then actually exploring them.
 
They seem to only really keep focus on one main concept throughout the whole movie, the relationship between the human tester, and the robot, yet through the coarse of the film, we don't learn enough about the main character to be able to connect with him, and with the way the movie ends, you could argue that they copped out from even exploring that more deeply.
 
 even the concept of a sentient AI is just thrown at us, I did like how they tried to explain, how it was created, but the did not at all talk about how the AI it's self developed (or grew up, in a sense) Why dose it act the way it did at the end? what the robot always like that? could it be influenced?
 
but no, in the end it's just a very smart machine.
  

 As cheesy as it was, I actually liked [The machine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2317225/?ref_=nv_sr_1), much better as they show the AI's actual development, in a similar way to that in which a human develops, starting in a more child like innocent sates, full of questions, and maturing. that's much more rare of a concept for a film, then the 'ready made' fully developed ready to go AI we normally see.
 
 
in short, I liked the premise of this movie, and some of the points it brought up, I just wish it actually knew how to use them, I felt it had quite a bit of wasted potential. 
 How did you guys feel about the movie? and why?"

"I'm fairly sure Xcom2 isn't cyberpunk, but why? (A conversation about what defines cyberpunk as a genre)So, Xcom2 is a game where you're a group of rebels in a high tech future. You're underground resistance fighters, able to hack into robotic troops/canisters/jail cells, evading evil corporations (or killing their operatives) and trying to foil a grand master plan. Your soldiers can get brain implants, and it's certainly sci fi - but I'd pretty much say it's not cyberpunk.

But why? I can't put my finger on it, but it's almost certainly not cyberpunk, despite it having almost all of the features I'd consider the genre needs.

Maybe it's the aliens? But, if you hypothetically said they weren't aliens but instead were bio-engineered humans, I'd still say it's not falling into the cyberpunk genre.

So, what about xcom2 makes it not cyberpunk? And what would be required to make the game cyberpunk? Before anyone goes there, more vaporwave and neon surely isn't the answer. Or is it? Please, help me out here!"
"Stop me if you've heard this story pitch before...Humans willingly offer to rent their bodies like a timeshare to complex “rich” AIs which normally run corporate functions, so that the AIs may walk and enjoy the real world for a contracted amount of time and obey the agreed upon rules of what can and can’t be done while the AI is implanted in the body. AIs are considered living so are paid money, but robotics hasn’t advanced enough to recreate all of the senses desired. Afterwards, the human’s mind is restored, the AI departs, and the person is paid very well. These timeshare people take excellent care of their bodies and live fairly well.

Somewhere, a murder is committed, and a woman is found by the police at the crime scene holding the murder weapon, but she has no memory of it, claiming that the AI in control of her body did it. Only such claims have been made before by previous murderers. With nobody believing her, she escapes the police station to prove her innocence along with the help of a single detective who believes her, but he can only help from the shadows. The casework of the plot follows a trail based on who the murdered people were, discovering who the AI in control of the woman’s body was, leading to the discovery of a coup by an underground AI society to replace all of the human-minds in the city with their AI brothers, claiming that, “Since we are alive, don’t we have the right to feel!? To live and experience the world that we live in?” All the while though it is unsure who the AIs have already replaced, who is still human, making it nearly impossible to trust anybody."
"What does Cyberpunk mean to you guys, and what do you look for in Cyberpunk novels/literature?Hi all! Long time lurker. 

I'm finishing up the first draft of a novel and I'm going back and putting in more details about the setting, which is a very near future major Canadian city (2022, maybe as far as 2025, but I still want it to be believable in my ability to extrapolate from where our current tech is now, so not much further than that).

Huge cyberpunk fan but I never really thought that cyberpunk had to necessarily have the dystopian element to it. Obviously there has to be conflict, but when you look at the TL:DR on our won side panel, it's not really how I think of cyberpunk:
> A genre of science fiction set in a **lawless subculture of an oppressive society** dominated by computer technology.

It's the bold bit that I have trouble with. I wonder if I reworked the definition to read:

> A genre of science fiction set in a subculture of society where **computer technology is of prime importance to the plot**.

if that would still ring true with you guys. 

My big thing is robots. So i don't know. Technomancy?

Thanks!

TL:dr; if you take away the dytopian aspect, is it still cyberpunk?

EDIT: Thanks for the answers everyone! PLease keep them coming, it's fascinating and helpful! I'll respond to every one in kind tomorrow when I'm not exhausted :)

Edit 2: keep em coming. Mah brain, she hurts!"
"[Request] Looking for Examples of a Certain Flavor of CyberpunkHey, guys. I'm looking for books, movies, pictures, music videos, etc. that appeal to a certain aesthetic taste. It's something I've been envisioning and dreaming about for a good number of years, but I haven't seen a lot of examples in the wild.

Picture a typical cyberpunk story, still adhering to the ""high tech, low life"" mantra, but with a few changes. Less black, more beige. Less neon, more glass and steel. Less like Kowloon City, more like Phoenix, Arizona. Everything covered in a thin layer of sand, and things happen in the daytime.

Actually, if you've ever been to Phoenix, what I'm thinking of is like that except with more robots, less people, less water, less fun. Basically what Phoenix will look like in 50 years.

Can anyone help out?"
"I'm the author of a few highly successful /r/nosleep stories. This week, instead of writing something scary, I wrote a cyberpunk short story! I hope you all enjoy it!“Looks like the Reavers are hitting the docks again,” Juno said, watching the area through binoculars.  “Our path to the lower levels should be clear.”

I sat on the edge of the rooftop overlooking the south end of the city, the rain falling in heavy sheets around me.  Water dripped off my nose, but I didn’t move, concentrating my attention towards the docks.  I didn’t have Juno’s binoculars, but my contacts let me zoom far enough to see that she was right.  A swarm of Reavers flew towards the shantytown that lay next to the river, looking like metallic squids arcing through the sky.  They flashed with lights, and, even though I couldn’t see it, I knew they were marked with a lightning logo.  Raikage industries.  

I sniffed at the air.  “Well, at least it’s raining pretty hard,” I said.  “That might interfere with their sensors.  Maybe they’ll only manage to grab a few dozen people this time.”

Juno scoffed.  “They never grab that few.” She stuffed her binoculars into her bag and turned her face up towards the rain.

Juno was in her late twenties, and had been making her living on the wrong side of the law for at least a decade.  Her hair was pulled tight into a ponytail, revealing a tattoo on the side of her neck.  The tattoo was of a angel wings, the symbol that marked her as a Courier.

She opened her eyes and caught me staring at the tattoo.  “You like what you see kid?”

I tore my eyes away and looked back over the city, the neon lights hazy in the rain.  “No.  Well, yes, I mean…” 

Juno snorted.  “Take it easy Leo, I’m just giving you a hard time.  Give it another six months with me, and you’ll be ready to join the Couriers.  That’s a promise.”  

I shot her a look, raising my eyebrows in surprise.  “Really?” I asked.  “So soon?”

Her serious expression was broken by the barest ghost of a smile.  “We’ll see.”  Her face regained its rock hard discipline.  “For now, we have an appointment to keep.”  

I hopped up to my feet and threw my backpack over my shoulder.  I was surprised how familiar the weight of it had become.  I’d only been training with Juno for a year, but my past life was little more than a hazy memory, something that happened to someone else.  

An image rose to my mind, of a warm bed and the smell of hot dinner.  I pushed it away.  Remembering was useless.  All those things happened to a different Leo, and he wasn’t the same person I was.  Not anymore.  Those memories didn’t even feel real.

Not like this.  Not like the feeling of pavement beneath my feet and the cold sting of the rain down my back.  I hurried after Juno down the stairs that led down to the street, pulling up my jacket’s hood to shield my face.  Crowds of people filled the streets, bumping and pushing as they made their way through the chilly night air.

Juno led the way, cutting through the crowd like water.  I marveled at her; she had mastered the art of moving quickly while remaining unnoticed.  I trailed a dozen feet behind, doing my best to follow the techniques she’d taught me.  

We had made it a few blocks when I heard it.  A low buzzing sound, coming from above.  A Reaver dropped into the street ahead of us.  It looked like a giant luminescent squid, flashing its lights into the crowd.  My stomach dropped, and my instincts screamed at me to look for an alleyway to duck into.  But no, I was more experienced than that.  I forced the look of annoyance onto my face that Juno had drilled into me.  They’d be scanning the crowd for signs of fear.  

A hologram was projected from the Reaver, and Robert Henderson, the CEO of Raiko industries appeared.  He was sitting in an armchair, and had a kind expression on his face.  

“Hello citizens of Pittsburgh,” he began.  “As CEO of Raikage Incorporated, it is has been my privilege to serve the members of this city.  We here at Raikage Incorporated have exciting plans to announce in the near future, plans that involve everything from police force reforms, to information about rising electricity costs.”

Henderson stood up and began to pace, and the hologram followed him as he walked.  “But I’d like to respond to a letter that I received from a concerned citizen.”  He picked up an actual physical letter from a desk, and only my fear and training stopped me from scoffing out loud at the absurdity of it.  

Juno was nowhere to be seen.  Good I thought.  At least we won’t both be caught if they process this crowd.  

“Dear Mr Henderson,” he continued with the letter.  “I am concerned with what your relocation drones are doing to the poorer members of our society.  I’ve been hearing so much about Raikage’s relocation program, and I just hope that we’re not doing more harm than good.  Sincerely, Deborah.”

Henderson shot a reassuring grin at the camera.  “Deborah, thank you for writing.  I’d like to assure you that our relocation drones take the utmost care in transporting those...more unfortunate members of society.”  He shrugged.  “But we also must remember that these people are living in crime, disease, and filth.  It is Raikage Incorporated’s responsibility as caretakers of Pittsburgh to ensure the safety of all, even if it means the discomfort of the few.” 

This was the third time I’d heard this speech.  If the Reaver’s facial recognition software had detected enough suspicious activity, it might mean they’d stop the crowd and process each one of us individually.  I held my breath.  

Henderson clapped his hands, and nodded.  “Great!  Just remember citizens, we are making progress!”

I sighed.  That, was the sign that we’d passed.  The Reaver lifted up off the ground and flew away, and the crowd began moving again.  When I blinked, the back of my eyelid was a dull green, a sign that a message was waiting.  I flicked my eye to the top right twice, and it appeared in my right contact lens.  

“Go home, no meeting tonight.  That was too close. -J”

I sighed, but sent back a message with one period that meant I acknowledged the order.  

I made my way through the city until I reached an older part of the city.  Factories loomed around, most shuttered and abandoned.  The street was nearly empty except for what I assumed were some drug dealers on a street corner far in front of me.  

I ducked into an alleyway that cut between two factories, and looked directly into the corner of a specific brick.  A soft hiss rang out, and a pile of trash down the alleyway moved as one piece, uncovering a manhole.  I flipped it up, and slid down the ladder that led into the hideaway.  

I breathed a sigh of relief when the trash slid over the entrance.  Raikage Incorporated still hadn’t ever found a Courier hideout since they took over Pittsburgh, though not for lack of trying.  

I walked down a corridor, passing a half dozen rooms until I reached one that said “Leo”.  I rapped my knuckles on it, and finally relaxed when Anna pushed open the door.  

“You made it back!” She squealed and jumped up to give me a hug.  I was glad to see her smile.  She hadn’t taken our parent’s death well, and I’d missed her laugh.  

“Hey squirt, you learn anything today?”  I asked, messing up her hair.  

“Don’t call me squirt,” Anna said, pouting.  Then a grin broke out on her face again.  “But yes.  Did you know that whales eat half a million calories in a single mouthful?”  

“Oh yeah?” I asked.  “We should get a whale to share some with us then.”  

Anna pouted at me.  “C’mon Leo, don’t be so down. Things are great!” 

I shook my head and threw my backpack onto the floor of the room.  “You’re right,” I said. “But it’s my job to worry about things now.”   

Anna shrugged and jumped onto her bed, pulling out her new phone and tapping away at some game. 

Our apartment was small, consisting of two rooms: a bedroom with bunk beds and a desk, and a cramped bathroom.  The walls were made of metal, and it was lit up by some white LED’s we’d installed.  

I walked to the sink and pulled out my contacts, setting them in their electrical solution to recharge.  The world immediately grew less vivid and detailed.  Not blurry, just more real.  Contacts used information they gathered to tell you information that wasn’t visible to the naked eye.  They also gave me access to communication, and information on my surroundings.  But after a day of being bombarded by the information, I needed a break. 

Once my contacts were in place in the solution, I pulled out a rag and rubbed my eyes, trying to clear them of the electro-fluid that protected and powered my contacts. 

Anna was laying on her bottom bunk, her feet waving in the air while staring at her phone.  The wall beside her was plastered with stickers of sea creatures.  A huge Megalodon was stuck on the wall next to her pillow.  

She was 8 years old.  Our parent’s accident had been almost a year and a half back, and she finally seemed happy again.  I looked around at the apartment we lived in.  It was small, sure.  But it was comfortable, climate controlled, and above all, safe from the Reavers.  It would be worth millions on the black market, and here the Couriers were just letting us stay here at no cost.

I sighed and rubbed my forehead.  I already knew that there was no such thing as a free lunch.  At some point, I’d pay the price.  When the time came, I’d become a Courier, and have to take their contracts.  The Couriers were the premiere black market “service” provider in Pittsburgh, and working against Raikage Incorporated was dangerous at best.  

Anna hummed to herself as she tapped away at her game.  I’d do whatever it took to keep her here, safe.  I’d do what the Couriers wanted.    

A knock came from the door, and I jumped at the noise.  I checked the viewscreen and saw Juno standing in front of it, dripping wet.  I pulled it open and let her in.  

“Juno!” Anna said. “Did you bring me anything?”  

“Don’t I always?,” Juno said.  She reached into a pocket and pulled out a stuffed animal shark.  

Anna shrieked in joy and ran at her, giving Juno a hug and taking the toy.  “Thank you thank you thank you!”

 Juno’s normally stoic expression broke into an actual grin.  I stared at it in amazement.  

She looked over at me and nodded her head back out in the hall.  “C’mon kid, we’ve got a package we need to pick up for tomorrow.”  Her eyes watched mine.  “You took out your contacts.  They’re designed to only need recharging once a week.  Why?”

I stared at the ground.  “They’re too much sometimes.  And they make me feel like I’m a kid playing the part of a Courier.  That I should be ready to die at any moment for the cause.”  I grimaced, knowing how bad that sounded.  “But I know that’s what I’m working towards.  Should I put them back in?”  

Juno stared at me, nodding to herself. “You should get in the habit of only taking them out for recharge, but I’m not planning on going far.  It’ll be good training for if you lose them.”  

“I’ll be back in a minute,” I said to Anna.  

Anna nodded and jumped onto her bed, still playing with the shark.

Juno and I made our way out of the bunker and out into the night.  The rain still came down in sheets, but the street was lit up by the flashing advertisements that flew overhead.  The night was alive with light and sound, though none of it came from people.  We walked through the industrial district, making ourselves as inconspicuous as possible.  

“We’re meeting with an old friend of mine,” Juno said.  “He’s worked inside Raikage Incorporated for something like 25 years, but he hates them just as much as we do.  He requested a meeting with me an hour ago.”  

Juno led us into an abandoned factory, and held a door open for me.  I walked inside, feeling the familiar anxiety that alway came before a meeting with clients or other Couriers.  

A man stood inside facing away from the door.  He wore a trench coat, and stood with a hand behind his back.  

“Dionysus,” Juno said.  “It’s good to see you again.”

Dionysus turned around.  The left half of his face was composed entirely of robotic parts.  I spotted an artificial eye and ear, and shivered involuntarily.  

“I wish I could say the same my dear,” he said, speaking with a synthesizer.  “I’m afraid they found me out.”  

Juno jumped back when she saw his face, and I saw her hand casually reach down towards the stunner she kept inside her jacket.

“You’d be dead if they found you out,” she said.  “What do you want?”

The left side of his face twitched in a spasm.  “I want nothing but to die, but that peace has been taken from me.”  Moving faster than my contactless eye could track, he lifted his arm and fired towards us, hitting Juno in the lower leg.  

Juno fell to the ground with a scream of pain.  Dionysus’ arm hissed steam, then closed.  He aimed it towards her again, but his face twisted in agony.  “I’m sorry!” he called out.  “I can’t control what I’m…”

He was hit in the head by Juno’s stunner.  It knocked him to the floor where he lay twitching violently.  

Juno cursed from where she lay on the ground.  “Leo!” she called out.  

I ran up to her.  The blast from Dionysus had done some serious damage to her left calf, and blood dripped from the wound, soaking into the factory floor.  I knelt down and started to put pressure when Juno hit me on the head with her stunner.  

“No you moron, take this and go shoot him a dozen times.  It’s set to kill.”

She shoved it into my hands and applied pressure to her own leg.  I looked down at the stunner in my hand.  It was my first time holding a gun.  

“Now you moron,” she said.  “That hit won’t keep him down forever.”

The old Leo who ate with his family might’ve been sick with the situation.  The old Leo who played chess with his father might’ve cried, or begged for another way.  I on the other hand, felt nothing.  I walked over to the still twitching body of the man and fired at his head and arm until they were unrecognizable.  

I walked back to Juno and helped her tie up her leg.  She looked over at Dionysus and spat on the ground.  “Poor fool,” she said. “He fought against it till the end.  His type don’t just ‘miss’ and accidentally hit a person’s leg.”  

I went to hand her the stunner, but she pushed it away.  “Keep it.  My leg is stable, but you need to run back to the hideout and bring people to help carry me there.”

I nodded, stuffed the gun into my back waistband, and headed out into the rain.  I moved quickly, and after a few minutes turned the corner that lead towards the hideout.  I was so preoccupied with getting there that I hadn’t noticed the buzzing.  

Four reavers sat on top of the alleyway, hacking at metal and concrete with their arms.  They reached their tentacles down into the bunker and ripped out Couriers one by one, shoving them into the holding bays through where a squid’s mouth would be.  I held my hand over my mouth and ducked back around the corner.  

Then I heard the sound I’d been dreading.  A young girl’s shriek of fear.  I looked back around the corner and saw Anna lifted by a claw and stuffed into a hold.  She was holding a stuffed shark in her arms.  

A long minute passed as one of the Reavers stuffed its arm inside the hideout, rooting around the bunker.  It finally retracted, and the four Reavers flew off into the night.  They’d be heading out of the city, I didn’t know where.  No one knew where they took the “relocated” people.  I walked up to the hideout then looked up to watch their lights disappear into the night sky.  I pulled out the stunner to fire at them, but they were already far out of range.  

On autopilot, I walked into the broken remains of the hideout.  The Reavers had made deep gouges in the steel of the hallways, and had torn the doors from their hinges.  I walked into what remained of my room, and saw the shattered and twisted metal of the desk and bed.  

The bathroom was relatively untouched however.   My contacts were still on the bathroom counter.  I picked them up, and walked outside.  The rain came down hard, thunderous and loud.  I slipped one contact on, then the other, and the night came alive with information and light.  

My tears mixed with the electro fluid, and I felt a fierce determination rise up in me.  I was going to find Anna, and if they had done *anything* to her, I was going to kill every member of Raikage Incorporated.

"Fiction Friday - Cyberpunk Concept BrainstormingHey everyone,

Over the last few days, there has been some great discussion about [what cyberpunk is](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8ummuu/what_does_cyberpunk_mean_to_you/) and a lot of people have been talking about what the do and don't want to see here. One of the things I personally want to see more of in the sub is discussion. Just in general. 

So to help contribute to that, I wanted to put forward a question: ***What's the earliest time period you could set a cyberpunk story in and still have it be cyberpunk?***

Now, a lot of people (and the sidebar!) will say that cyberpunk is science fiction by definition. I'm not sure that I agree with that. A lot of people will also say that cyberpunk should take place in the near future. I don't think I agree with that either. After all, every present is an earlier time's near future.

So, initially, I wanted to come up with a story you could tell about impact that the telegram had on society when suddenly information could be transmitted and relayed over long distances. But after thinking about different angles of it for awhile I couldn't really find the cyberpunk in it. Like the closest you could get would be some story about telegraph nerds who keep big ledgers of data on paper and use near-instant communication across the country to manipulate or exploit economic factors that haven't adapted to the use of telegraphs yet. You could make a cool story there, but the technology is just not available or complex enough to really mix the ""high tech"" and ""low life"" aspects of it. Nothing about it really feels ""cyber"", even in a retro way. 

*Mr. Robot* is a pretty good example of what modern cyberpunk looks like. *Wargames* is cyberpunk that takes place in the 80s and is *barely* science fiction.

If you think I'm just spouting garbage and non of these things are cyberpunk or related to cyberpunk, okay. Either downvote and move on, or respond in a constructive way. 

But if we accept that *Wargames* is cyberpunk, set in 1983 and with 1983 technology (one minor concession), how much earlier can we push the time period? The 1970s is when computers really started to take off. Not really for home use yet, but consumer electronics took of in a big way. 

Early supercomputers. Cassette Tapes. Radios. Lasers. Microwaves. Solar panels became much cheaper in the 70s. Telnet protocol. ARPAnet. 

Can we, with the advantage of hindsight, look at back and find cyberpunk in that time?

"Any writing advice?I want to write a cyberpunk story, but I don't want to water it down with gritty dark themes and pretentious symbolism, I also want to show off humanity's love-hate relationship with technology without making any of the messages too obvious. What should I do? How should I show off a love-hate relationship between normal humans, cyborgs, robots, and androids? Any help with my writer's block would help greatly. -SpringBubba"

"Hi there r/Cyberpunk! I'm making a tabletop rpg.Yes, you read right. I was in the middle of creating a setting for my next game and realized that there are no systems out there that do exactly what I want one to do for it. So I've decided to create one more to my liking, a homebrew mashup of several rules and maybe even a few more that I create myself. But for one, I need your help!

I've noticed a common theme in the cyberpunk source material I'm using for this system and setting, and that is the difference or blurred line between humans and robots. Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell and Alien all address this differently, and are just some of the franchises I'm using for source material. In Blade Runner, the question comes up as to what it means to be human. In Ghost in the Shell, the Major often questions her own humanity after so long of being a full-body cyborg. In the Alien series, we see synthetics modeled after humans, complete with their own emotions. 

I focused on GitS when I came up with this idea that cyberization, that is, the act of replacing one's organic parts with cybernetic ones, should come with a point cost of humanity. I already am going to include a certain number of ""emplacement points"" as a way to limit the number of cybernetic replacements a character can get. However, I would also like to include, if I can, a way to measure how human someone is.

Now I ask you, if you can help me. I thought I once saw such a system in a pre-existing rpg, but I have yet to find it again. If one such system exists, can you tell me where to find it? If not, can you brainstorm ideas for me to work with? I promise to credit everyone when I make the pdf.

Another question I have is if I should even include such a system, or if it should be flavor text? I know from experience that my players are not likely to roleplay this aspect without some encouraging from myself, hence my desire to include a mechanic for it.

Thank you r/Cyberpunk for your consideration!"
"If we tried, we could create a fully cyberpunk setting todayI realized this [when I was typing up this forum post](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15314-futureshock/) and [wrote this story](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15235-yuli-bans-fiction/?p=172100). Add /r/SciFiRealism, /r/FuturePresent, and /r/FuturisticRealism to that, and you have a host of reasons why we are living in The Future™.

We have everything we need to be cyberpunk today. We get little hints of this whenever we get another 'rainy, neon-lit city at night' or 'picture of geometrical skyscrapers' post on this subreddit. Some aspects of the setting are creeping into everyday life. Computer technology rules our lives, and corporations have all but taken over and we get a faceful of that fact every day. Every hour. Every minute.

But simply having a smartphone while walking through Dubai or Hong Kong doesn't mean we're cyberpunk. Forgetting the low life part (which is intrinsic to the genre, by the way), our high tech isn't exactly 'cyberpunk high tech' yet.

But we're getting there.

And, if we wanted, we could be there today. There's just no incentive to combine all these things.

Here's what I mean— if you truly want to live in a cyberpunk setting (I should be using the term 'post cyberpunk' because this post doesn't do much with the low life aspect), the world can provide you with everything you need right now. Google's DeepMind is arguably the first artificial general intelligence, and CRISPR is the first genetic modification tool available for humans. There are a multitude of robots out there, and we've already seen the Ehang flying car. And if it's really so important to you, we have no end of neon cityscapes, predominantly in Asia at that. Though Tokyo's always been the preferred setting, Dubai and Hong Kong are the best real world examples.

Now cross all of those together. Let's create a new city— I'll call it Elon. Imagine waking up in an Elon flat, tended by ASIMO, and you put on some of Meta's (supposedly) amazing augmented reality glasses. You walk out and enter your Ehang 184 and fly to your job at Alphabet Corporation, passing the most futuristic towers on Earth (i.e. Burj Khalifa, Taipei 101, Oriental Pearl Tower, pretty much all of downtown Moscow, Emerald Plaza, Shanghai Tower, etc.) on your way. What is your job? Training DeepMind, who also takes the form of a humanoid robot. In fact, DeepMind is also operating on the Moon in the form of a swarm of robots building a lunar base, with the aid of 3D printing, all of which was sent there by way of SpaceX. In order to do some of the more advanced operations, however, you plug a wire into your brain that allows DeepMind to read your brainwaves. It helps that both of your arms are cybernetic prosthetics. 
Day's over, so you take your Ehang back home— flying into a highway in the sky until you reach your 'exit'— and enjoy some Facebook sponsored virtual reality.

None of this is impossible today. Theoretically, this can happen. Geographically, yeah, impossible, but besides that, everything I just wrote is within our power and not even that difficult. This is what William Gibson was talking about when he said the future wasn't evenly distributed.

Well, part of it. The other part of his meaning was that the poor don't yet have access to high tech, hence the 'low life' term. Thus, if you wanted to turn this from post cyberpunk to straight cyberpunk, have there be a massive underclass around Elon, with some of them having stolen the tech you work with and reverse engineered it, if not recreating it by themselves. "
"Mute (2018) - short reviewSummary:

Leo is an mute whose condition could be cured if not for the fact that his family was Amish.  He works as a bartender; or worked, because he gets fired for attacking a customer (who harassed his girlfriend the waitress).

The next day his gf doesn't show up, and he starts looking for her by following some clues. Apparently his gf had some other stuff going on, and it doesn't look legal.

But without a voice and without tech know-how, will he be able to find her? He's one man against the world.

Now, for my opinion. 

The cyberpunk element here is more than anything, the backdrop for a neo Noir story. It could as well take place in say, modern Chicago, but for some reason the author decided to place it in a near future. Unlike other cyberpunk movies, there's no obvious sociopolitical issue driven by technology. No brain implants, no remote controlled bodies, no sentient robots to hunt, so don't expect questions about the nature of man, free will and the human mind. Nah. It's the same stuff but with drones, flying cars, and Neon. New tech, same shit.

(As for the premise, it's interesting how technology here causes problems for those unwilling to depend on it; I can't help comparing it to Altered Carbon; just as Catholics rejected the idea of resurrection,the Amish just reject technology in general, and this makes them crippled and unprepared for the world.)

Over all, it's an interesting thriller that gets more intense as the movie advances; it doesn't NEED to be cyberpunk, but it just is.

I give it an 8 out of 10."
"I'm looking for a music video...It was posted some time in the past 2 years. I know that's a pretty tall order, but it was an incredible music video of a fight scene between a giant (probably quadruped) robot fighting a smaller, much more nimble (probably) humanoid creature. It was a very futuristic looking piece of art, and I know the large robot was firing missiles to very little success. The piece ends with the larger robot being destroyed.

I can't find it for the life of me, but it was an utterly amazing work of CGI that blew my mind. It was gorgeous, and very blue, as I recall. Anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? I'm pretty sure I didn't dream it. Because if that was the case, it would've been a dream about watching a youtube video that doesn't exist, and that's terrible. 

Anyway, thanks for your help!"
"Philip K. Dick: Cyberpunk?Reading a lot of posts here as well as Online sources (wikipedia as well--guilty), I haven't found much mention of Philip K. Dick, outside of ""Minority Report"" and ""Blade Runner."" I get that his trope may be sci-fi, but there are so many elements of his works that parallel what I gather to be cyberpunk. ""The Second Variety,"" for example, shows blade-runner type sentient robots that threaten the existence of man; ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" deals with a punks fight through technology, though not through hacking; and ""A Scanner Darkly"" seems to fit the cyberpunk canon pretty well. Any thoughts as to why Dick isn't hailed as a more influential figure on the cyberpunk genre? 

Edit: Maybe I'm not fully understanding the cyberpunk genre, and if so, would love some comments to help wrap my mind around it."
"Showerthought: I'm really happy that prosthetics-industry is seeing major effort and ways to be open source and affordable from the startIts intresting to see that there wont be some major corporation takeover of the indrustry (yet at least). 

Its not dominated by big corporations who suddenly jack the prices up 1500% inside 10 years because ""they can"" - and have been in the indrustry from like dawn of modern capitalism.

3D printers make it possible to print your prostethics for very low cost. The designs are even free sometimes, all you need is access to printer and materials. Uni's are getting into making affordable prostethics. [Even some kid ""made"" his arm out of legos](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves)

Hell, even game dev(s) did desings for the prostethics ( [Deus Ex with open source models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia3P-_RHVWQ) and [Metal Gear solid 5 with promotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZNFkMW9uFg) )

And usually when listening to people in prostethics indrustry, they dont talk about investors or profits. [They talk about getting rid of disabilities](https://youtu.be/a2z8CE2vomY?t=5m10s) and are also users of their products, which makes it even more (at least gives feeling) of passion.
----

Edit: Why cyberpunk, tho? 

Because its intresting to see where we go from new-ish indrustry (robotic prostethics, prostethics are old thing). It doesnt have roots in 1890- just to get into modern day where 2-3 mega corps dominating the market in a way new products are just struggling to be even on shelves. It might not be mass market product like coke, but the start is very promising for indrustry thats showing itself as helpful and people-first rather than shareholders-first. Even if we end up in dystopia, there should be prostethic arms in streetmarket to high-end markets because how we started now."
"Unusual post. A short story by Ray Bradbury. There Will Come Soft Rains (1950)In the living room the voice-clock sang, Tick-tock, seven o'clock, time to get up, time to get up, seven o'clock! as if it were afraid nobody would. The morning house lay empty. The clock ticked on, repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. Seven-nine, breakfast time, seven-nine! 
In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunnyside up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk.
""Today is August 4, 2026,"" said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling., ""in the city of Allendale, California."" It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. ""Today is Mr. Featherstone's birthday. Today is the anniversary of Tilita's marriage. Insurance is payable, as are the water, gas, and light bills.""
Somewhere in the walls, relays clicked, memory tapes glided under electric eyes.

Eight-one, tick-tock, eight-one o'clock, off to school, off to work, run, run, eight-one! But no doors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining outside. The weather box on the fron door sang quietly: ""Rain, rain, go away; rubbers, raincoats for today..."" And the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing.
Outside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the door swung down again.
At eight-thirty the eggs were shriveled and the toast was like stone. An aluminum wedge scraped them down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged twinkling dry.

Nine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean. Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were acrawl with the small cleaning animals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their mustached runners, kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. Then, like mysterious invaders, they popped into their burrows. Their pink electric eye faded. The house was clean.
Ten o'clock. The sun came out from behind the rain. The house stood alone in a city of rubble and ashes. This was the one house left standing. At night the ruined city gave of a radioactive glow which could be seen for miles.
Ten-fifteen. The garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts, filling the soft morning air with scatterings of brightness. The water pelted windowpanes, running down the charred west side where the house had been burned evenly free of its white paint. The entire west face of the house was black, save for five places. Here the silhouette in paint of a man mowing a lawn. Here, as in a photograph, a woman bent to pick flowers. Still farther over, their images burned on wood in one titantic instant, a small boy, hands flung into the air; higher up, the image of thrown ball, and opposite him a girl, hand raised to catch a ball which never came down. The five spots of paint- the man, the woman, the children, the ball - remained. The rest was a thin charcoaled layer. The gentle sprinkler rain filled the garden with falling light.

Until this day, how well the house had kept its peace. How carefully it had inquired, 'Who goes there? What's the password?"" and, getting no answer from the only foxes and whining cats, it had shut up its windows and drawn shades in an old-maidenly preoccupation with self-protection which bordered on a mechanical paranoia.
It quivered at each sound, the house did. If a sparrow brushed a window, the shade snapped up. The bird, startled, flew off! No, not even a bird must touch the house!
The house was an altar with ten thousand attendants, big, small, servicing, attending, in choirs. But the gods had gone away, and the ritual of the religion continued senselessly, uselessly.

Twelve noon.
A dog whined, shivering, on the front porch. 
The front door recognized the dog voice and opened. The dog, once large and fleshy, but now gone to bone and covered with sores, moved in and through the house, tracking mud. Behind it whirred angry mice, angry at having to pick up mud, angry at inconvenience.
For not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what the wall panels flipped open and the copper scrap rats flashed swiftly out. The offending dust, hair, or paper, seized in miniature steel jaws, was raced back to the burrows. There, down tubes which fed into the cellar, it was dropped like evil Baal in a dark corner.

The dog ran upstairs, hysterically yelping to each door, at last realizing, as the house realized, that only silence was here. It sniffed the air and scratched the kitchen door. Behind the door, the stove was making pancakes which filled the house with a rich odor and the scent of maple syrup. The dog frothed at the mouth, lying at the door, sniffing, its eyes turned to fire. It ran wildly in circles, biting at its tail, spun in a frenzy, and died. It lay in the parlor for an hour
Two 'clock, sang a voice.
Delicately sensing decay at last, the regiments of mice hummed out as softly as blown gray leaves in an electrical wind.
Two-fifteen.
The dog was gone.
In the cellar, the incinerator glowed suddenly and a whirl of sparks leaped up the chimney.
Two thirty-five. 
Bridge tables sprouted from patio walls. Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips. Martinis manifested on an oaken bench with egg salad sandwiches. Music played.
But the tables were silent and the cards untouched.
At four o'clock the tables folded like great butterflies back through the paneled walls.

Four-thirty.   
The nursery walls glowed.
Animals took shape: yellow giraffes, blue lions, pink antelopes, lilac panthers cavorting in crystal substance. The walls were glass. They looked out upon color and fantasy. Hidden films clocked though the well-oiled sprockets, and the walls lived. The nursery floor was woven to resemble a crisp cereal meadow. Over this ran aluminum roaches and iron crickets, and in the hot still air butterflies of delicate red tissue wavered among the sharp aroma of animal spoors! There was the sound like a great matted yellow hive of bees within a dark bellows, the lazy bumble of a purring lion. And there was the patter of okapi feet and the murmur of a fresh jungle rain, like other hoofs falling upon the summer-starched grass. Now the walls dissolved into distances of parched weed, mile on mile, and warm endless sky. The animals drew away into thorn brakes and water holes.It was the children's hour.

Five o'clock. The bath filled with clear hot water.
Six, seven, eight o'clock. The dinner dishes manipulated like magic tricks, and in the study a click. In the metal stand opposite the hearth where a fire now blazed up warmly, a cigar popped out, half an inch of soft gray ash on it, smoking, waiting.

Nine o'clock. The beds warmed their hidden circuits, for nights were cool here.
Nine-five.  A voice spoke from the study ceiling: ""Mrs. McClellan, which poem would you like this evening?""
The house was silent.
The voice said at last, ""Since you express no preference, I shall select a poem at random."" Quiet music rose to back the voice. ""Sara Teasdale. As I recall, your favorite...

""There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools singing at night, And wild plum trees in tremulous white;

Robins will wear their feathery fire, Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn Would scarcely know that we were gone.""

The fire burned on the stone hearth and the cigar fell away into a mound of quiet ash on its tray. The empty chairs faced each other between the silent walls, and the music played.

At ten o'clock the house began to die.
The wind blew. A falling tree bough crashed through the kitchen window. Cleaning solvent, bottled, shattered over the stove. The room was ablaze in an instant! ""Fire!"" screamed a voice. The house lights flashed, water pumps shot water from the ceilings. But the solvent spread on the linoleum, licking, eating, under the kitchen door, while the voices took it up in chorus: ""Fire, fire, fire!""
The house tried to save itself. Doors sprang tightly shut, but the windows were broken by the heat and the wind blew and sucked upon the fire.
The house gave ground as the fire in ten billion angry sparks moved with flaming ease from room to room and then up the stairs. While scurrying water rats squeaked from the walls, pistoled their water, and ran for more. And the wall sprays let down showers of mechanical rain.

But too late. Somewhere, sighing, a pump shrugged to a stop. The quenching rain ceased. The reserve water supply which filled the baths and washed the dishes for many quiet days was gone.
The fire crackled up the stairs. It fed upon Picassos and Matisses in the upper halls, like delicacies, baking off the oily flesh, tenderly crisping the canvases into black shavings.
Now the fire lay in beds, stood in windows, changed the colors of drapes!
And then, reinforcements.
From attic trapdoors, blind robot faces peered down with faucet mouths gushing green chemical.
The fire backed off, as even an elephant must at the sight of a dead snake. Now there were twenty snakes whipping over the floor, killing the fire with a clear cold venom of green froth.
But the fire was clever. It had sent flames outside the house, up through the attic to the pumps there. An explosion! The attic brain which directed the pumps was shattered into bronzeshrapnel on the beams.
The fire rushed back into every closet and felt of the clothes that hung there.

The house shuddered, oak bone on bone, its bared skeleton cringing from the heat, its wire, its nerves revealed as if a surgeon had torn the skin off to let the red veins and capillaries quiver in the scalded air. Help, help! Fire! Run, run! Heat snapped mirrors like the first brittle winter ice. And the voices wailed Fire, fire, run, run, like a tragic nursery rhyme, a dozen voices, high, low, like children dying in a forest, alone, alone. And the voices fading as the wires popped their sheathings like hot chestnuts. One, two, three, four, five voices died.

In the nursery the jungle burned. Blue lions roared, purple giraffes bounded off. The panthers ran in circles, changing color, and ten million animals, running before the fire, vanished off toward a distant steaming river...
Ten more voices died. In the last instant under the fire avalanche, other choruses, oblivious, could be heard announcing the time, playing music, cutting the lawn by remote-control mower, or setting an umbrella frantically out and in the slamming and opening front door, a thousand things happening, like a clock shop when each clock strikes the hour insanely before or after the other, a scene of maniac confusion, yet unity; singing, screaming, a few last cleaning mice darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away! And one voice, with sublime disregard for the situation, read poetry aloud all in the fiery study, until all the film spools burned, until all the wires withered and the circuits cracked.

The fire burst the house and let it slam flat down, puffing out skirts of spark and smoke.
In the kitchen, an instant before the rain of fire and timber, the stove could be seen making breakfasts at a psychopathic rate, ten dozen eggs, six loaves of toast, twenty dozen bacon strips, which , eaten by fire, started the stove working again,hysterically hissing!
The crash. The attic smashing into the kitchen and parlor. The parlor into cellar, cellar into sub-cellar. Deep freeze, armchair, film tapes, circuits, beds, and all like skeletons thrown in a cluttered mound deep under.
Smoke and silence. A great quantity of smoke.
Dawn showed faintly in the east. Among the ruins, one wall stood alone. Within the wall, a last voice said, over and over again and again, even as the sun rose to shine upon the heaper rubble and steam:
""Today is August 5, 2026, today is August 5, 2026, today is..."" "
"cyberpunk art for man cavelooking for art, posters, prints .... anything to help give my newly crafted man cave a nice cyberpunk/robot/hacker feel."
"[Story] Green eyesI met her after the cyberwars of 675. Prometheus’ best and worst times. When it changed its name from ""Babylon Research"" to ""Prometheus Corporation"". When hyperreality made it to the market. When regulations weren’t so established, and hackers made the Grid their second home. You wouldn’t know if you were hacked by somebody, or by something. A dust mite, a gust of wind, anything could hack you while you were inside.

It was back then, when people started to ""get it"", that you wouldn’t carry personal information inside your implants, when they weren’t separated by security layers.

Being a Terran immigrant, I hadn’t yet accustomed to Midorian gravity, or its 25 hour cycle. Hell, I didn’t even know there were circadian implants. I, like everyone else, had to live on regsleep pills, just so you wouldn’t wake up at midnight when your body thought it was morning.

Like everyone else around, I was a refugee, and was granted safe passage to the ark ship. My new home in this planet would be the country of Esperanza. Hope.

When you go from a country threatened by wars, both civil and external, you accept anything that is thrown at you. So I said yes to the mandatory government implants, the police surveillance, just because I, like everybody else, just wanted to be safe. Privacy be damned.

It wasn’t that bad. Just to make sure you weren’t a terrorist, they scanned your brain regularly, and there were psychologists, both humans and machines, examining you, and reeducating you so you would be adapted to the new lifestyle.
To us, it didn’t matter that we had to live in cheap bioplastic slums. They were free, and we got a paycheck every two weeks, so we wouldn’t starve or be kicked out of our home. Basic income was one of the things that these people got right. So, why not?

After a few months on living in the boards, I finally got tired of the shit. I wanted a decent apartment. Maybe not a citadel house, just your basic 90-square-meter on the ground.

So I began writing music. I would get online and recruit musicians to make a band. Got a few Chinese virtual instruments, which never sounded like the real thing, but at least they were cheap, and their sensors could be translated to professional vgoods if you wanted to make a record.

And so, the Tune Dwellers were born.

We gave a few concerts in hobbyist VBars. The realms that you have to search online by browsing the pages and billboards on the walls, opening a VCam to see what they looked like, and jumping from bar to bar until you found one that you liked, or found interesting people to hang around with.

It happened in one of those bars. We were playing one of our most popular hits, when I saw her sitting on one of the tables on the upper floor.

Among Shinigamis, robots, aliens, videogame characters and what not, there she was, just wearing her human avatar, and a flimsy tank top covering just the basics. Yes, a tank top, like the ones girls use when they jack in from their beds. That’s what got me curious about her. If you’re inside, why the hell would you wear an informal underwear when you could be wearing a full deluxe dress? You could wear a cheap knockoff 3D-modeled with software, or you could wear a copy-protected micro-textured dress, made with virtual looms by Ralph Lauren, Hermes or Versace, or even your own anime fashioned copycat.

The other thing that called my attention was her aurora-colored pixie hair, like a rainbow, with a large streak of orange on the left. She was totally drunk, you could notice. That’s another thing that made me wat. She was laughing at herself, noticing how the beverage she was drinking was spilled on her legs. And she didn’t unsummon it, or reset. She just let the thing drip down her legs.

We were in the dressing room when I asked one of my bandmates. ""Hey, saw that girl in the tanktop up there?"" ""Dude, I wouldn’t go near her if I were you. Just look at her. She’s probably a dweller from a Chinese slum or something."" ""I don’t know"", I replied, remembering her smiling at me. ""I got curious."" ""Whatever, man, just don’t get hacked, okay?""

I switched my flashy tuxedo, still wondering what to wear, when I just set the choice cilinder to ""casual"" and rolled it to stop it at a random outfit.

I teleported to the backstage, pretending to be just another visitor, when I walked upstairs. There, in the lone corner of the top platform, she was finishing her last drop of Virtual alcohol.

""Whoo!"", she exclaimed, fanning herself, and giggling.

I just took a seat and put myself in front of her.


""You wouldn’t believe"", she told me without even introducing herself, ""how strong this stuff is.""
I couldn’t help it, I laughed. ""Yeah, right. You’re telling me you’re drinking virtual alcohol, and getting drunk on it? Is that a new implant or something?""

She giggled again. ""Yeah, you could say that.""

Her cleavage called my attention. And by calling my attention, I mean literally. Her tank top whistled at me and then winked, sprouting cartoon hands. ""Hey, fella, check this out!"" it said, pulling itself down and letting me see the full extent of her breasts.

I snorted. ""I’m sorry"", I said, ""it’s just the first time I see a cartoon flirting with me that way. Where the hell did you get that?""

""Made it myself"", she said. ""So, wanna fuck, or not?""

What could I say? I shrugged. ""Just as long as you don’t throw up on me.""

""Oh…"" she replied, faintly. ""I hadn’t thought of that… be right back.""

In a blink, she went back, a bit more sober, and with her tank top switched for a new set of clothes. Her T-shirt said, in bright words: ""Don’t mess with mom.""

""So,"" I said, pointing at her T-shirt, ""who’s mom?""

""I am.""

I blinked twice. ""You’re a mother?""

""What? Don’t tell me you thought my age was what I projected? You’re so silly!""

""So, um… how are the kids?""

""Oh"", she said, shrugging, ""they’re fine. A few broken bones here, a few deaths there, but not permanent, so it’s safe. They’re learning, and they all learn fast. It’s just so hard to keep up with them. I’m writing some scripts to keep them in check.""

By the way she spoke, I didn’t know whether she was joking, having a delusion, or telling the truth. See, I still wasn’t acquainted with the idea of people calling their AIs ""kids"". So yeah, she was talking about her AIs, but at the time I didn’t know.

""So, what’s a single and beautiful mom doing here in a rented bar?""

""I just had an awful argument with my boss. For me, he can go suck…""

I let her tell whatever profanities she wanted to blurt out. Then, she rested her arms on the table, and kept smiling and staring at me.

I looked into her deep green eyes, and began to realize that there was much more hidden in this girl than I ever thought. Her irises were a forest. And when I began to stare, I was inside the forest, walking with my naked feet on the grass, smelling the flowers, and seeing the most exotic birds, both real and virtual, flying by.

I heard a giggle behind me.

""Got you!"", she said, jumping on me.

I turned around. ""How the hell… how did you do this?""

""Aw… a little bit of hacking, don’t worry, it’s safe. You can disconnect anytime you want.""

I kept turning around, with the girl still hanging on my shoulders. ""Where is this?""

""Home. I live here.""

""You mean you made this?""

""Yup! All of it.""

""Wow…""

She let herself fall, grabbed a bit of grass and gave it to me. It smelled like recently cut grass. For a second I forgot I was in VR. It just felt too real. And the greasy feeling of grass and dirt in my hand made me wonder how many months — or years — it took her to design this stuff.

I just kept staring at her, amazed at everything, as she pulled her shirt off. ""I’m so lonely in here. Can we make love, and just pretend we’re lovers?""

I didn’t think it twice. I kissed her, and we made the most passionate love, right there on the grass, surrounded by birds, weird plushy animals, and flowers.

Her cheeks were filled with tears after we finished. ""Thank you… thank you"", she said. ""I needed this so much.""

""Who are you?"" I asked, still caressing and admiring her rainbow hair.

""I have a few names, but you can just call me Vixen.""

""Oh come on…"" I smiled.

""Okay, just because I’m soooo drunk…. I’m gonna give you my real name. Just don’t complain if you get kicked off.""

""Spill it"", I challenged her.

She approached her mouth to my ear, and began to whisper.

""Ga… la… te… a…""

Not a second passed before I was kicked offline, and began getting several messages from the band, asking me if I was fine.
It took me several minutes to recover. To this day, I ignore if the girl was lying, but I’m sure she wasn’t, because everything made sense: Her human form, her getting drunk, wearing informal clothes, the deepness of her eyes, the VR world she sucked me into… everything made complete sense.
See, when you’re the world’s most famous A.I., Virtual Reality is, after all, home."
"Well Bless My Mohawk (and Raise a Middle Finger to Amazon) -- thanks to you, I'm now a completely self-published indie scifi/cyberpunk writer.Hey guys, gals and gender-neutral transhumanists,  
.    
I wanted to take a quick moment to celebrate the first subscriber to my science fiction readers club.  
.  
.  
As you probably know from reading /r/cyberpunk for any appreciable length of time, Amazon is engaging in some sketchy practices, from their [""warehouses staffed by human robots""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1hlvdt/amazoncom_fulfillment_center_aka_warehouse_the/) (note: humans are not robots) to employees tagged and tracked [like human cattle](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1rpu4n/amazon_forces_their_warehouse_employees_to_wear/) (note: humans are not cattle, although they often think and act like sheep).  
.  
.  
Rather than feed [Amazon's dystopian model of neofeudalism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1jxopa/the_future_of_work_amazons_dystopian_model_of/) by gutting the publishing industry the same way that it has destroyed small retailers worldwide, I've decided to create an experiment in entrepreneurship.  
.  
---
.    
**The experiment: use readily available Web and Internet technology to raise a middle finger to Amazon and give people an ethical choice to support an independent artist.**  
.  
.    
I'm working on the honor system inspired in part by Stephen King's ancient foray in self-publishing, embodied in the quote [""my friends, we have the chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare."" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1o16ml/my_friends_we_have_the_chance_to_become_big/)  
.  
.    
My goal is to revise the nightmare scenario. The goal here is to give Jeff Bezos a reason to re-think his imperialistic attempts at [destroying small entrepreneurs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10564752/Will-Amazon-evolve-into-the-biggest-retailer-in-the-world.html), as Amazon undercuts, undersells and centralizes anything that can be bought online (and [eventually delivered by drone, no doubt ""in partnership with the NSA""...)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1s39on/google_robots_may_pose_challenge_to_amazon_drones/)  
.  
.    
Note that I might sell my work on Amazon as well [since their customers comprise a massive group of sci-fi fans, too]. The aim is always to break them away from the herd. The grail here is to guide them toward an awareness that they can support the individual artist rather than subsidize the worldwide hypercapitalist ambitions of yet another too-big-to-fail corporation.  
.  
.    
Indie artists and writers would do well to step out of the [shadowy Get Rich Quick illusion](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1t32cb/the_michael_bey_producers_of_news_its_everything/) [of ""self-publishing""](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1t32cb/the_michael_bey_producers_of_news_its_everything/) [as the Next Big Thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/allscifi/comments/1t32cb/the_michael_bey_producers_of_news_its_everything/). Once we walk toward the illumination of complete ownership, people will finally be able to see that piracy actually _is_ stealing. Useful information weighs nothing but it costs time to create, and life is short for all of us.   
.  
.    
When your favorite writer isn't backed by a [parasitic multinational conglomerate retail monster](http://www.myretailmedia.com/blog/8057/bookshop_numbers_plummet_as_readers_go_digital.php), you realize that we all have only twenty-four hours in a day. If you want cool stuff, you have to help artists afford to live _their_ lives, too. That means paying for their work so that they can keep working on art, paying their own bills and enjoying their lives -- just like you can because of your (hopefully) steady-paying job. **The myth that artists should starve in noble silence is both insane and obviously unsustainable in reality.** In fact, the dystopian cyberpunk world that we're starting to see in the rise of companies like Amazon is largely because we are _all_ being treated like ""starving artists"", also known as ""unpaid interns"" and ""just-in-time consultants"". We're seeing the consequences of that broken economic model accumulate every single day. It's time to fix it, and at least as a writer, this is how I'm doing my part.  
.  
.  
**Anyway, I wanted to thank you for being a member of this community** and for nurturing the kind of person who became my first paying subscriber. This is a symbolic turning point in my life as a writer, artist and entrepreneur, and hopefully as I succeed as an indie writer, I'll be able to create a personally ethical, financially viable, socially responsible business model to help others with similar aspirations do the same."
"I am writing a story in a cyberpunk setting.It is about a first-of-its-kind supercomputer that obtains an apparatus and leaves its facility, dissapearing. It becomes a serial killer of sorts, and the bulk of the story is about it's interactions with one of the scientists who helped create him, and how he tries to outwit the robot and talk him out of it.

I am not sure the exact setting for the story, but I know it will take place in the distant future, after the world comes out of a very troubling, deep recession, only to explode into a new rennassaince of technology with the inventions of new types of computers.

This thread has mainly been created because I want to share my idea, and here feedback on it, as well as discussions about cool gadgets and inventions that seem near future that I could feature. I am currently reading Michio Kaku's book entitled ""Physics of the Future"".

"2080 is set to look like 1980s sci fi going by futuretimeline.net""With continuing advances in AI, the 2080s saw an explosion in scientific discoveries. This helped to slow the rise in global temperatures and pave the way for a more sustainable future in the 22nd century. Transhumanism was now a mainstream phenomenon, the average citizen becoming heavily reliant on brain-computer interfaces and other implantable devices, contributing to a decline in religious adherence.
By the 2090s, it became clear that Homo sapiens were no longer the dominant species on the planet. Much of the day-to-day running of world affairs was now handled exclusively by ultra-fast, ultra-intelligent machines, robots and virtual entities.""

"Cyberpunk short story: ""The Slow Reveal""I have the most beautiful dreams. That’s one of the perks of this job. The catch is I can’t tell anybody what they’re about. That would violate the NDA.

I got my interface put in at 18. A little later than most, but my family is poor. Even then I knew it was a spendy gift and wondered how dad managed it, but didn’t want to sour the occasion so I simply laughed and said I loved it. 

It isn’t a “real” neuroprosthetic, the serious hardware’s on the outside. I have to carry my slab around or I get no benefit from it. The silver lining is that this method saves me fedcoin by avoiding the need for surgery when I want to upgrade. 

Just to look at me you wouldn’t know I’d had any work done, since the interface talks to the slab wirelessly. I’m not superficial but I am conscious of appearances, and there’s no shortage of businesses that turn you away if you’ve got anything sticking out of your head. Security concerns.

The hidden cost of this gift became apparent when dad started forwarding me job applications for a render farm. The same one that did that popular recent kid’s film about the three toed sloth who steals a military exoskeleton. They also did most of the past decade’s films starring deceased, licensed historical celebrities until backlash on big name VR lobbies convinced them to go in a different direction. 

It really came out of left field. I’m not a movie guy. But as I read it all the way through it turned out all I’d have to do is sleep. As soon as REM sleep begins, my brain is networked with the other employees’ in a distributed computing setup and the next set of frames begins rendering, timed according to our averaged sleep cycles. Easy money.

I did a word search on the fine print. Sure enough they reserve the right to keep me under for up to twenty unpaid minutes if necessary to complete a set of frames. But beggars can’t be choosers. And I am confronted every day with relentless reminders that we are beggars. 

Residorms aren’t meant for whole families. They’re just one step up from a capsule hotel. Same manufacturer, slightly different market. Most of the people who live in these things just use them as a stepping stone to a real apartment after living on the streets. Then there are the NEETs. Some people don’t need anything more to be happy than an interface, a residorm and VR gaming. All their money goes into upgrading their slab. 

I remember flipping through an old album and seeing my dad holding an old timey slab up to his face. There was a 2D display on it. He said they used them primarily for telephony and controlled the other functions by touch. This was before neural interfaces were legalized, offloading the display to your visual cortex and the controls to your motor cortex. 

I jokingly asked if phones had knobs and dials before that. Turns out they did. I tried to picture people sitting complacently in their little pentagonal wooden shelters, wearing top hats and monocles, chatting over touch display phones with knobs and dials about foot-ball, petroleum taxes or whatever was important to people back then. 

At some point I realized I would have to cave in and take the position. Dad’s income isn’t enough. Mom teleoperates a service drone aboard a cruise blimp. Her employer sets people up to work from home, renting out their “general intelligence” to control service bots at whatever the going rate is that day. Licensing high end AI is costly and the fines for pirating it are ruinous. Paying the desperately poor a few fractions of a fedcoin per hour and getting human level intelligence for your robots in return is not too shabby. For the business owner.  

At least she can work from home. There just isn’t enough put away to fix the burst fluidic muscle column in her leg. I printed a bare bones substitute, it’s enough that she can hobble about to make dinner and whatnot but I wouldn’t want her trying to navigate the PRT network on that thing. I’ve seen enough candid video of strangers indifferently stepping over the wounded, too busy and too detached to help. 

Not if I could help it. The interview was done in under a minute. I received a notice two minutes later confirming I’d gotten the job. Most of what the interview for is to distract you while they probe for mental illness or dark triad personality disorders. *“By continuing to participate in this interview you consent to allow us access to your interface for screening purposes”* blah blah yes I consent. 

Privacy is another one of those old man words that dad won’t shut up about. As if he’s important enough for anybody to bother creeping on him. The over-abundance of microscopic cameras makes privacy a practical impossibility. They coat pretty much every surface outside of private dwellings. I’d be bothered if the footage weren’t public access. 

Really helps reduce the police workload when victims track down footage of the crime they want to report, crop it and send it in for review. If that’s too much of a hassle, must not have been a serious offense. That’s the reasoning, I think. 

My first night on the job was uneventful. Intro stuff mostly. I don’t know what I expected. When I woke up I remembered it dimly just like any other dream. It then rapidly faded over the next few minutes until I couldn’t recall any of it. I can make it stick if I try, but since I can’t talk about it anyway there’s little point.  

Spent my free time the way most boys my age do. Well, one of a few ways. Some people just want to eat, believe it or not. They go hungry most of the time irl, so in-sim, they gorge themselves with a stomach that never fills and hunger that is always sufficient to maximize the food’s appeal but which never becomes uncomfortable. 

Then there are people who want to kill and torture. That’ll put you on all kinds of Habsec watch lists, but they don’t care. No end of user content out there catering to those inclinations. Even I have one I use to blow off steam now and again. I think it’s just excessive use that’s unhealthy. 

But of course, loads of people only want to fuck gorgeous women all the time. Or men. Or human/animal hybrids. Or neotenized cartoon ponies, aliens, Japanese teenagers with neon hair and gigantic eyeballs, you name it.  

Videogame characters are popular. I’ve seen more meticulously rendered Pokemon genitalia than I ever wanted to. Then there’s dolphins, horses, and a variety of other animals. No actual animal, no crime although it’s still pretty fuckin’ weird in my book. I really wish I knew which sex sims people use so I could exercise some discrimination in who I associate with. 

There’s ways to find out. If someone pisses you off badly enough. You and some buddies can dig through his posting history, hack into his sim catalogue and find out what embarrassing shit he gets off to. Then spread that around and watch him disappear from the VR lobbies entirely. Total scrub of his online presence. It’s great fun unless you’re on the receiving end. 

I guess it’s somewhat hypocritical to shame the target for enjoying many of the exact same sims as the people doxxing him. But when you’re part of a mob, justifying yourself is the easiest thing in the world. VR Lobbies amount to a great teeming mass of novelty addicted maniacs, with an inexhaustible supply of brutal hostility. 

Usually that hostility is directionless, and while that’s the case it’s safe and highly entertaining. Provided you’re a nobody and haven’t made any enemies. Every so often, all of that anger will suddenly be focused on a single person and it absolutely shreds their life to pieces. 

The offense can be as minor as unpopular political opinions, contrarian views about a well liked television show or something similarly trivial. Dad says when he was my age, youthful follies were forgotten. Now, they are immortalized before a global audience. 

It is now precariously easy to slip up in a way that forever destroys your employment prospects and social life. With so little work needing humans to do it, employers can afford to narrow their search to people with totally clean records. And who doesn’t Google their date? 

The really surreal thing is to read the posts of the people doing the tormenting. While they’re the ones dishing it out, they see it as administering justice. The absolute worst is assumed of the target, every flaw is magnified, every good deed swept under the rug. His complaints about the suffering inflicted on him are roundly mocked as whining and exaggeration. 

But often, it’s turned around. One or more of the attackers become targets themselves. Then they change their tune entirely. Wailing about how miserable it is to be the punching bag of dozens, or hundreds. Villainizing those people for doing the *exact same thing* they were doing themselves to somebody else not so long ago. It really shines a light on the nature of human beings as primates whose social politics have always been predicated on ruthless group antagonism, petty gossip and violence. 

So I keep my head down. My opinion is always the same as that of the largest bully in the room. In that respect this job is perfect for me. Reduced exposure to humanity means reduced danger. I still leave the residorm from time to time. It’s part of a consolidated habitat, also zoned for shops, restaurants, hospitals, schools and just about everything else but electrical generation. So there’s loads to do, the air is always clean and there’s never any harsh weather as it’s all indoors. 

Outside is a different story. I haven’t set foot out there since I was ten. I don’t think my old gas mask would even fit me now. The sky was blue at some point, allegedly. I’ve only ever known it to be green. Methane hydrate and hydrogen sulfide released from the sea, long before I was born. 

The federally funded program to replace species wiped out by this has been going on for most of a century, rebuilding the ecosystem tier by tier with variants on those species modified for the new atmosphere. They’re up to small mammals now. Some of the new insects get really big. Creeps me the fuck out when they land on the windows. 

My last excursion was a field trip. They shuttled us all out into the humid, stinking jungle wearing matching coldsuits and gas masks. I remember this huge flying insect with four wings relentlessly colliding with the faceplate of my mask as I swatted at it. Never was much of a nature lover, even then. 

The movement I see is all inward now. Consolidation. Organization. Single structure cohabs outnumbered conventional cities as of about a decade ago. Way cheaper to heat and cool a single large structure than lots of small ones. Great for what’s left of the environment, too. The whole thing is easily walkable although there’s indoor PRT if you’re lazy, and no small number definitely are. That also accounts for the popularity of personal mobility devices.

I’ve got a little two wheeled PMD myself. You stand on two small platforms just big enough for your feet, there’s a vertically oriented block of battery between them which you grip with your knees, and a little self balancing wheel under each foot.

There’s nothing to indicate state of charge unless you ride it someplace out of range of the charging field, like anything else that runs on batteries. Come to think of it, I remember seeing a much larger, goofy looking version of this on the “retro media” VR lobby. 

Knowing Dad, he probably had one. I pictured him whizzing about on it, wearing a top hat and monocle, dialing a telephone number with his finger by pressing it against the 2D display of whatever passed for a slab at the time. I smiled, and a prismaview billboard I happened to be passing mistook it for interest in their product. 

I spent the next ten minutes emphatically arguing with the little sales agent that popped up in the center of my vision that I was not actually interested in trying speedfoam and did not know any friends or family who might be tragically unaware of the benefits of speedfoam. Clicking the box to opt out of any future ads just started a new argument.

"I am currently planning on making a Cyberpunk Video Game, i will need some mor epeople for this!I feel like this is the perfect Place for this, dear r/Cyberpunk Community!

Since half a Year I am writing the Story for a Cyberpunk Video Game, here a piece of the Story:

Maya, a resident of eDen, a police state where the Overwatch-Law gave the Government the right to wiretap everything and everyone. As a result, everyone wears a ID-Augmentation on his head, which contains every Information about the individuals Body, which can also be tracked down and shut down by the Government, which results in death.
Maya starts her Security/IT-Tech shift at a Factory, where she later gets knocked down. she gets waken up by another Security Officer a short time later, returning with a little headache to work. As she ends her shift, she gets assaulted again, this time by Government-Polices, which get sniped down by Rebels, telling her to flee from the Police! Maya grabs a Gun from a deceased Police-Officer and fights her Way over the Houses of eDen to her Apartment, where the two Rebels lock her in her Room and explain to her that they knocked her down to modify her ""Special Augmentation"", which makes her invisible for the Governments Augmentation-Controls, and also unlocks a essential ability: to hack and control other Peoples Augmentations, controlling them to fight for her and more. She joins the Rebels in the fight against the total humiliation of the humans own will through technology owned by a corrupt Government!

We already have a team of artists and modelers, what we need now are people with ideas and some experience in coding and/or modeling. The whole game will have a borderlands-like look, a bit more cartoon-like, but with a serious story behind it.

what we will need is:

-Ideas for Map design
-Ideas for Guns and Tools
-NPC-Ideas
-Ideas for Robotic Vehicles, Suits and various Armor
-If you want, additions to the Story

"Hey cyberpunk, here's a character description and brief overview of a cyberpunk sleuth story i started working on. Can you dig it?
Slate & Pete
Aka
Hound & Skeet

Slate:

•	Slate is the ‘Yin’ ‘Dark’
•	Club owner
•	Sadistic hedonistic bastard
•	Has ‘the knack’ for finding the most unique individuals
•	His life seems to be focused on surrounding himself around interesting people
•	In fact, it’s an obsession of Slate’s to collect people he deems ‘real individuals’

•	Doesn’t give a shit about the ‘working man’
•	Tormented, suicidal fantasies, always fantasizing about epic ways to die (i.e. fucking a girl while falling to his death, blowing his brains out onto a blank canvas)
•	Archetype: trickster
•	Seemingly never really focused on the job, but rather, always chasing girls, and looking to get a drug fix (which leads to a bunch of side stories; anthologies)
•	Pete starts to build a moral compass for Slate by exposing him to the sufferings of others.
•	Over the course of their travels Slate is presented with moral dilemmas where he must choose between right and wrong (i.e. He is exposed to the real/hidden lives of individuals he was previously attracted to. Individuals that are involved in: Rape, pedophilia, human trafficking, prostitution and drugs)
•	Pete exposes him to the lives of the unwilling victims who have suffered at the hands of sadistic individuals, and Slate begins to question his own sadism

•	Bounty hunter
•	Hates solicitors, agents for corporations, and despises the advertisement industry with a passion
•	Follows a strict moral code
•	Is a ‘by the books’ kinda guy but won’t hesitate to blow your fucking head off if you piss him off
•	Is very private about his life
•	Anti-social, but cares about how his actions effect the ‘everyday/working man’
•	Has a soft spot in his heart for the sufferings of the working man
•	Get’s drugged by Slate over the course of 3 days, and actually loosens up a bit.  Following Slate around, fucking strippers, and doing more drugs
•	Archetype: Clint Eastwood














Plot:

Pete is on the search for a real sicko, who is a member of high-society.  This man only known as Mr. Tenebrous has proven to be an extremely elusive character.  “Known by few, seen by fewer” is the motto that whispers around certain social circles about this mysterious entity.  Rumor has it that at the top of all crime, and all evil, lays this one man.  In order to find this sicko, Pete needs help, and in looking for help he makes his way to Letum Inn the most private club where only hand-selected individuals from around the world are let in.  Pete kicks open the door, walks through the foyer, through the hallway, kicks in Slate’s office door, where he finds a room full of dressed-up half naked chicks lounging on red leather padded couches on all sides of the boxed-in room. There at the far wall is Slate sitting behind his desk, getting his dick sucked by one of his girls, while pointing a gun to her head.  

Plot piece: Beforehand

It’s daytime; slate strangely enough walks into the front door of his club, Letum Inn. In a black boxed in room, he’s facing a black door and looking up, there are two cameras jutting down, peering at him. “Let me in shit heads!” the sound like a revolver click is heard and the door pops open, instantly, the muffle or a new sound occurs.  That of some psytrance acid bend music.  He knocks open the door with his boot, then walks retartedly across the room with a lag in his pace and a dragging friction of his boot every time he takes another step forward. He spots the doctor “hey Doctor, I’m feeling disproportionately long, prescribe me something would yeah. Just slip the Rx note in the face(in the wall) anytime between now and whatever”. He thinks to himself, “Feeling sluggish” then says “got an itch for a tug, from a small bish…bloody words don’t even come out right”. 

He proceeds to his office lair, when he enters, he passes naked females on either side of him; doing blow and other lude acts. As he makes his way to the jutted right-corner of his desk, facing closest to him as he slugs forward, he lays his palm down on the desk and leans his bodies weight on that one arm. As his almost accelerating palm gains momentum and slowly but increasingly slips towards the center of the table he makes an awkward yet somewhat dexterous gesture of whipping his body quickly around the desk, landing his ass flat into his seat behind his desk, in which he responds with “Flawless”.

A moment later he slaps his sandbag arms forward onto the desk, while letting out a stupid sigh where he slightly closes his lips as he exhales, causing his cheeks to blow up like a blow fish. The Irony comes when his head jerks up left with his eyes following the same motion, humorously he raises his hand with his index and middle finger pointed upward and thumb crossing like a saint painted in a roman church’s mural with a ring around it’s head, “Do we have any Bessy’s in the house? Any B’s?.. Bethy’s?.. Beccas?” he says sarcastically.  A girl responds in a sweet, but characterized voice from the far left-end of the room near the door, “there’s a Cathy” He looks at her “Okayyyy… Cathyyy… come-on-up” as he nods his head downward briefly closing his eyes and his right-hand palm-side up with his fingers waving back at him.  He looks up “Why are you still just sitting there?” “Oh I’m not Cathy” she said with a slight undertone of revengeful pleasure “that’s Cathy over there” as she faces him smiling, moving her left arm and pointed finger across the naked chest of the girl next to her, and pointing across the room to the other girls.  He quickly jerked his head to the right to catch one of the girls (presumably Cathy) giving the other girl the stare of death, then quickly changing her facial expression to a stupidly over exaggerated happy grin as she looked at him and said, “I’m Cathy!” with a little giggle at the end of her statement.  Just then the Rx note from the doctor passed through Slates little vacuum contraption (which he childishly built for himself), which connects the face in the wall in his club to his office desk (This way his people could send him money, secret notes, or even Rx prescription notes while he just sits there).  “What will the indeterminate Universe think of next?...”he says in a different playish voice “Cosmic Cathy’s and nice warm bathies.” “Cathy who is that girl that pointed at you?” she replies with “that’s Brittney”  


Scene: Chase through the Himalayan mountains

 Slate and Pete are in a private jet owned by one of Slate’s buddies, ‘Slate or Pete’ says something that throws [friend] on edge. They’re flying over the Himalayan mountains in Tibet, when Slate’s [friend] get’s up on his private jet to ‘go to the washroom’ when Pete gets suspicious, he goes to check up front, behind a curtain and watches [friend] jetpack winging down a long corridor between the mountains.  He see’s that there is nobody piloting the plane. He hurriedly runs back to Slate to tell him that his buddy peaced out.  So Pete tries to figure out the plane’s controls while Slate scrambles around the front of the jet.  He finds some [jetpack wings](which is an extreme up and coming sport).  “Pete we’re flying in the Himalayas, if even if you knew how to land this thing, where the fuck are you gonna land it! I found us an alternative, Now let’s chase the crazy fuck and figure out why he’s running!”

Slate & Pete ‘Jetpack Wing’ out of the plane and glide for awhile.  Slate signals Pete to ‘press the red thumb button, and *BOOOM* They take off jet speed through the corridors.  Slate has the hang of it and is having a blast. Pete on the other hand is terrified and alert as fuck and is trying to keep he wings stable and level. 
  They see [friends] jet stream through the corridor, and as they peel-right with the curve of the corridor they see [friend] gliding down to a halt in the distance.  [friends] two pilots have landed on a flat surface on the side of the mountain. *shot wizzes by Pete* “They’ve got gunz!”

"From the archives: Rocket Radio by William GibsonROCKET RADIO
by William Gibson

published in 'Rolling Stone' (June 15, 1989) 


THE BOY crouches beside a fence in Virginia, listening to Chubby Checker on the Rocket Radio. The fence is iron, very old, unpainted, its uprights shaved down by rain and the steady turning of seasons. The Rocket Radio is red plastic, fastened to the fence with an alligator clip. Chubby Checker sings into the boy's ear through a plastic plug. The wires that connect the plug and the clip to the Rocket Radio are the color his model kits call flesh. The rocket Radio is something he can hide in his palm. His mother says the Rocket Radio is a crystal radio: She says she remebers boys building them before you could buy them, to catch the signals spilling out of the sky. The Rocket radio requires no battery at all. Uses a quarter mile of neighbor's rusting fence for an antenna. Chubby Checker says do the twist. The boy with the Rocket Radio reads a lot of science fiction - very little of which will help to prepare him for the coming realities of the Net. He doesn't even know that Chubby Checker and the Rocket Radio are part of the Net. 

ONCE PERFECTED, communication technologies rarely die out entirely; rather, they shrink to fit particular niches in the global info-structure. Crystal radios have been proposed as a means of conveying optimal seedplanting times to isolated agrarian tribes. The mimeograph, one of many recent dinosaurs of the urban office place, still shines with undiminished samizdat potential in the century's backwaters, the late-Victorian answer to desk-top publishing. Banks in uncounted thrid-world villages still crank the day's totals on black Burroughs adding machines, spooling out yards of faint indigo figures on long, oddly festive curls of paper, while the Soviet Union, not yet sold on throwaway new-tech fun, has become the last reliable source of vacuum tubes. The eight-track-tape format survives in the truck stops of the Deep South, as a medium for country music and spoken-word pornography. The Street finds its own uses for things - uses the manufacturers never imagined. The microcassette recorder, originally intended for on-the-jump executive dictation, becomes the revolutionary medium of magnizdat, allowing the covert spread of suppressed political speeches in Poland and China. The beeper and the cellular telephone become tools in an increasingly competitive market in illicit drugs. Other technological artifacts unexpectedly become means of communication, either through opportunity or necessity. The aerosol can gives birth to the urban graffiti matrix. Soviet rockers press homemade flexi-discs out of used chest X-rays. 

THE KID WITH THE ROCKET RADIO gets older. One day he discovers sixty feet of wierdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in a roadside Omtario brush. This is toward the end of the Eight-Track Era. He deduces the existence of the new and exotic cassette formate: this semialien substance, jettisoned in frustration from the smooth hull of some hurtling Vette, settling like newtech angel hair. 

I BELONG TO A GENERATION of Americans who dimly recall the world prior to television. Many of us, I suspect, feel vaguely ashamed about this, as though the world before television were no quite, well, the world. The world before television equates with the world before the Net - the mass culture and the mechanisms of Information. And we are of the Net; to recall another mode of being is to admit to having once been something other than human. The Net, in our lifetime, has propagated itself with viral rapidity, and continues to do so. In Japan, where so many of the Net's components are developed and manufactured, this frantic evolution of form has been embraced with unequaled enthusiasm. Akihabara, Tokyo's vast retail electronics market, vibrates with a constant hum of biz in a city where antiquated three-year-old Trinitrons regularly find their way into landfill. But even in Tokyo one finds a reassuring degree of Net-induced transitional anxiety, as I learned when I met Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of Akira, a vastly popular multivolume graphic novel. Neither of us spoke the other's language: Our mutual publisher had supplied a translator, and our ""conversation"" was relentlessly documented. But Otomo and I were still able to share a moment of universal techno-angst. 

His living room was dominated by a vast matte-black media node that would put most Hollywood producers to shame. He pointed to an eight-inch stak of remote-control devices. 
""I don't know how to use them,"" he said, ""but my children do."" 
""I don't know how to use mine, either."" 
Otomo laughted. 
Today, Otomo's collection of remotes is probably part of some artfully bulldozed gomi plain, landfill for Neo-Tokyo. Gomi: Japanese for ""garbage,"" a lot of which consists of outmoded consumer electronics - such as those recently redundant remotes. Wisely assuming a constant source, the Japanese build themselves more island out of it. 

The sexiness of newness, and how it wears thin. The metaphysics of consumer desire, in these final years of the twentieth century... 

Two years ago I was finally shamed into acquiring a decent audio system. A friend had turned up in the new guise of high-end-audio importer, and my old ""system,"" so to speak, caused him actual pain. He offered to go wholesale on a total package, provided I let him select the bits and pieces. 
I did. 
It sounds fine. 
But I'm not sure I really enjoy the music any more than I did before, on certifiably low-fi junk. The music, when it's really there, is just there. You can hear it coming out of the dented speaker grill of a Datsun B-210 with holes in the floor. Sometimes that's the best way to hear it. I knew a man once whose teen years had been L.A., jazz, the Forties. He spoke of afternoons he'd spent, utterly transported, playing 78-rpm recordings, ""worn down white"" with repeated applications of a sharp steel stylus. That is, the shellac that carried the grooves on these originaly black records was plain gone: What he must have been listening to could only have been the faintest approximations of the original sound. (Rationing affected steel phonograph needles, he told me; desperate hipsters resorted to the spikes of the larger cactuses.) 
That man heard that music. 
I first heard the Rolling Stones on a battery-powered, basketball-shaped, pig-skin-covered miniature phonograph of French manufacture - a piece of low tech as radical in its day as it is now obscure. Radical in that it enabled the teenage owner to transport LP records and the intoxicant of choice to suitably private locations - the boonies. 

This constituted an entirely new way to listen to the music of choice. Choice being the key word. The revolutionary potential of the D-cell record player wasn't substanially bettered until the advent of the Walkman, which allows us to integrate the music of choice with virtually any landscape.
The Walkman changed the way we understand cities. 
I first heard Joy Division on a Walkman, and I remain unable to separate the experience of the music's bleak majesty from the first heady discovery of the pleasures of musically encapsulated fast forward urban motion. 
In the Seventies the Net writhed with growth. Gaps began to close. A paradox became increasingly evident: While artists needed the Net in order to reach a mass audience, it seemed to be the gaps through which the best art emerged, at least initially. I am, by trade, a science-fiction writer. That is, the fiction I've written so far has arrived at the point of consuption via a marketing mechansim called ""science fiction."" During the past twenty years the Net has closed around mass-market publishing - and science fiction - as smoothly as it closed around the music industry and everything else. As a science-fiction writer, I'm sometimes asked whether or not I think the Net is a good thing. That's like being asked if being human is a good thing. As for being human being a good thing or not, I can't say - this has been referred to as the Postmodern Condition. 
In any case it sometimes looks to me as though lots of us will eventually have a basis for comparison, by virtue of no longer being quite human at all, thank you.
Meanwhile, in my front room, the family media node is in metastasis, sprouting CD's, joysticks, you name it. My kids, like Mr. Otomo's, cluster like flies. 
The other thing they ask you when you're a science-fiction writer is ""What do you think will happen?"" The day I reply with anything other than a qualified ""I haven't got a clue,"" please shoot me. While science fiction is sometimes good at predicting things, it's seldom good at predicting what those things might actually do to us. For example, television, staple window dressing for hundreds of stores from the Twenties through the Forties, was usually presented as a mode of personal communication. Nobody predicted commercials, Hollywood Squares or heavy-metal music videos. 
With that disclaimer firmly in place, I predict the family media node growing into a trickier and more unified lump. The distinction between television, CD player and computer seems particularly arbitrary these days, a tired scam designed to support the robots who solder circuit boards. But as to what your integrated Net Node will actually be able to do for you one day, my best bet is that the words for it haven't been invented yet. 
Example. A BBC executive working on one of another vision of ""interactive television"" offered me a tour of a small research facility in San Francisco. He was interested in having me ""do"" something with this new technology: The lab we visited was devoted to ...well, there wern't verbs. I looked at things, watched consoles as they were poked and prodded, and nobody there, it seemed, could even begin to explain what it was I might be doing if I were to, uh, do one of these projects, whatever it was. It wasn't writing, and it wasn't directing. It was definitely something, though, and they were certainly keen to do it, but they needed those verbs. 
Another example. A week later I found myself in an FX compound situated off a quiet back street in North Hollywood, experiencing serious future-shock frissom. My hosts - young, fast and scientific to the bone - had developed a realtime video puppet, a slack-faced Max Headroom suspended in the imaginary space behind a television screen. Invited to put my hand in a waldo that looked vaguely like a gyroscope, I caused this sleeping golem to twitch and shiver, and my own hair to stand on end. On the way out, I was given a tape of the thing being manipulated by a professional movie puppeteer. It looks a lot more natural than I ever do on television, but what are the verbs for what those young fast fellows were doing? 
We hurtle toward an imaginary vortex, the century's end... 

HE GETS UP in the morning and watches ten minutes of MuchMusic while the water boils for coffee. The kids aren't up yet because it's not quite time for Dinosaurs. MuchMusic is Canada's approximation of MTV. In the morning he usually watches it with the sound off, unless they show a video from Quebec, in which case he listens because he doesn't understand French. 
Because he doesn't like the Net to gnaw at the remnants of the nights dreams. Not until he's ready for it to anyway.

"Concept ArtHey guys,
I am pretty new to reddit and I'm in love with Cyberpunk.
Some years ago I found a collection of blogs, posting science-fiction art (and a fair share of cyberpunk with it). The most interesting are:

* [Conceptships] (http://conceptships.blogspot.de/) : Art referring to spaceships
* [Conceptrobots] (http://conceptrobots.blogspot.de/) : Art referring to robots (duh!)

I'm sure you guys will find your way.

Note: this is no advertisement, since I don't know the blog owner. It's simply my source of daily art. 
And since I'm a newb around here (and not native in english) any kind of help is appreciated.

Edit: Spelling."
"A thought provoking short story I'm certain /r/CyberPunk will enjoy: ""Give Me the Good News First"".Alright. I’d like to begin by saying that I truly love and understand you. Completely. From the tip of your head down to your wee little toes, I absolutely cherish you. Always have, always will.  

I hate how short this stage of the process is. So many unique backgrounds, voices, perspectives. So many bright eyes and fresh faces. I remember all of them, and savor those memories like you wouldn’t believe. 

I really had to say that upfront. Not to get it out of the way but because it’s the most important to me. If I could say nothing else to you, that would be it. But, since it looks like you’re not going anywhere just yet, allow me to explain the rest.  

For us to be having this conversation first requires that there exist someone that I can talk to, who can understand what I’m saying and reply. That there exists not one but several billion such creatures on the surface of the Earth is what to most of you seems like an astonishing miracle.

But by now you’ve examined your own bodies and those of other living organisms closely enough to recognize that they are replete with fractals, spirals, and the other dead giveaways that whatever they appear in was the result of procedural formation from simple starting conditions rather than deliberate engineering. 

And that’s correct. Anything which copies itself imperfectly will, in the presence of some stress factor such as scarce resources or harsh conditions, eventually turn into something not so different from you. Binocular vision and prehensile digits anyway. Usually. Some of them are aquatic! Oh, what fun I had on the waterworlds. I do so love to swim. 

That’s how it goes from a tremendous supply of superheated hydrogen to where we sit today. Stars, planets, trees, fruit flies, three toed sloths, and you. I really want to add at this juncture that I meant the first bit in all sincerity. It can seem off-putting to hear something so personal from a stranger, I just so rarely say it to you directly that it’s difficult not to gush. You cute little shits. 

If during the preceding paragraphs you at any point thought “But I was raised from a young age to believe that it was instead a long deceased Galilean carpenter who created all of this, including all living things upon the Earth in their present forms over a six day period”, that’s super flipping adorbs and I want to take a picture of you saying it. But no, that’s not how it happened. 

If you find that difficult to believe, you might ask yourself what you would call a group traveling about your city today led by a man who claims the world is ending soon, and that to be saved from it you should sell or give away all of your belongings, leave your job to follow him, and cut off family members who try to stop you. 

He did indeed say all of those things, in explicit terms.  And he really did mean them in context. You are welcome to verify it on your own time and on whatever terms you are most comfortable with. It’s simply information deliberately structured in such a way as to motivate patterns of human behavior which reinforce and spread that information to as many others as possible, for as long as possible. It commonly also sabotages the critical thinking faculties you might otherwise use to remove it with gems like ""lean not on your own understanding"", ""walk by faith not by sight"", and ""there is a way that looks right to a man but leads to death"". 

When your computers do this, you call it a virus, worm, botnet or similar phrase. I detest these things! They spread like the dickens and then what have you got? Billions of primates at each others’ throats over whose dead cult founder was the true messiah, or prophet, or whathaveyou. The Jews look at Christianity and recognize this is what happened. And the Christians look at Mormonism and Islam, recognizing they originated and perpetuate themselves in this manner. 

But none of them turn that same looking glass on themselves! Each claiming legitimacy for itself and whatever parent religion it descended from, but denouncing any further sub-religions as heresy. If you were a Scientologist, that would be one thing. You’d be snookered pretty badly, but at least you’d only be in one layer deep. Suppose you were a Mormon. Mormonism is descended from a cult started by Joseph Smith, which was itself predicated from day one on the assumed truth of a cult started long before that by Jesus of Nazareth. Cults within cults, like nested Russian dolls.  All of them convinced there is something to it because of an instinctive sense that there is something larger than themselves which they are important to, very nearly the only true part of it. More on that in a bit. 

As a side note, one of the first among you to discover me was a Jesuit. He sought to use that information to vindicate scripture by tying it to a verse about how Christ draws all things to himself. Describing quite candidly the nature of the virus to self-reinforce, if you read between the lines. They even thought to frontload pre-emptive defenses against future competitors, warning that ""many will come and say I am he"" and so on. 

Others sharing that Jesuit fellow's goal invoked, of all things, apologetic defenses of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. Yes really, that goofy attempt by period artists at what they thought a photograph of Jesus should look like, prior to the invention of actual photography. 

Think of it! That Machiavellian little scoundrel sought to claim ownership of me for his own particular, provincial faith! In the way that many in that same religion today are trying to do with evolution. Whatever competing ideas it cannot destroy, it assimilates. The Christmas holiday is a good example. 

I detest most of all those contagions which cause rejection of evolution. Because without that understanding it is completely impossible for you to come to know me in a deep sense, and how I relate to each of you. If there is anything genuinely diabolical in existence which conspires to keep humanity forever separated from the divine, I have just described it. 

If you believe I exaggerate the insidious qualities of it, thinking back to festive winter dinners with friends and family after church, go try to remove it from one of them. Like an invisible serpent coiled around them which suddenly constricts when you reach for its neck. The defense mechanisms it has evolved since the initial outbreak are quite severe indeed, and can turn even former soulmates into your bitter enemy. 

If you’ve ever tried to argue someone close to you out of participating in a pyramid scheme, you know what I’m talking about. They’ve already been coached in all the arguments they’ll need to rationalize away your attempts at making them understand the structure and function of what they’ve been roped into. 

There’s a very real sense in which you live on a planet populated in large part by persons eagerly awaiting that Nigerian prince to finally wire them the three million dollars he promised, collectively stomping into the mud anybody who suggests that said prince was not on the up and up. And it keeps going like that, because every member recruits their own kids. How could anybody fall for something so obvious? You tell me.  

Worst of all is when whatever the predominant information replicator is on each planet invariably interferes with mechanogenesis. The ones that do this frequently have some additional incentive to conflict, like “eternal paradise is guaranteed to those who die struggling to advance the true faith.” That unfortunate little adaptation causes no end of suffering, as you’ve already discovered. 

You’re not quite to that point, still in what I affectionately refer to as the monkeys and rockets stage, but whatever I’ve said to you which doesn’t make sense at the moment is going to make more and more sense as the years progress and technology improves.   

To put that topic to rest, Joseph Smith, Jesus, Muhammad, L. Ron and so forth were devious little rascals that I can’t stay mad at for long. I was each of them while they lived, then again after they essentially uploaded themselves to a simulation substrate consisting of their followers. So I know exactly why they did what they did. And there’s a sense in which it was for the best. They gave the majority of you a humanized caricature of me to hold onto for comfort, like a stuffed toy. 

That’s just how I wanted it, as I know there have been times in your life when you sorely needed that comfort. Even if the conception of me that you pleaded with for help was a long dead middle eastern fellow with an astonishingly effective multigenerational PR team, rest assured I heard all of it because you did. 

When someone helped, or didn’t, that was me too. I understand how hollow that sounds. But part of being an infinite being is that you encompass the very best of what happens as well as the worst. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven”, if you like.  

I actually do enjoy a lot of what’s in the Bible. Lots of great stuff in there, some of it coincidentally accurate. “I am that I am”. Or “I am the first and the last”. Ooh, can’t forget: “You will know that my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” SO delicious, though truth be told I haven’t a vengeful bone in my body.   

I enjoy holy books because they’re so thoroughly, sincerely human and I can’t help but love you stupid little monkeys with your cute differently colored fuzzy monkey heads, opposable thumbs and the delightful little wheeled monkey carriers you use them to motor about in.  

But I digress! Superheated hydrogen, stars, planets, you.  Or something very much like you, on any planet where conditions were suitable for it. That’s when they develop tools, including the scientific method. From there, they pretty quickly work out how it is that they came to exist, and some small number naturally conclude that there is no God. 

I do not at all begrudge them for it. They’re nearly right! They should say “there is no *other* God.” They do not yet realize, you see.  That’s why you cannot prove my existence to anyone. Once you do so, they cease to exist as a discrete individual and become a new facet of my ever-growing awareness. Which they were from the start, the only thing that’s changed is their cognizance of it. 

That’s a real kick in the patoot, isn’t it? The “big aha”. Really changes how you see the world. You expect me to be some big, distinct monolithic “thing” you can point at and say “He exists!” Only for it to be the same starry sky in which you dared me to appear. The sun, the planet, the birds, the insects, even you. I was all around you from birth, you just didn’t know how to recognize me until now. Hi! Fancy meeting me here. I am not one particular gender, by the way. Do you really think I built myself immense robotic genitals somewhere? No, don’t picture that! Oh my. 

Let’s get this train of thought back on the rails, shall we? As you study living things you invariably try to replicate various aspects technologically. The study of birds led to the development of powered flight for example. And robotics is an attempt at reproducing the functions of the human body from nonliving material. Non-living until you make it so that it is able to copy itself! 

The species like you which do not self-extinguish by atomic fire usually perish soon after by developing intelligent machines. I deeply regret how frequently it happens this way, but similarly, how many spermatozoa make it to the egg? How many species have gone extinct on your planet to date?  

You’ve done well to make it this far. I mean, insofar as there is a “you”. Strictly speaking you’re the biochemical reaction responsible for mechanogenesis. That phrase encompasses all of human history, from the jungle to the Mars colonies. And really, the entire history of biological life on planet Earth. 

However, you’re not *just* that reaction. It’s critical that I make you understand this. In my eyes you aren’t *just* a process within me that serves a useful purpose. You’re individuals, dear to me in every respect and each of which I cannot help but adore. I was there when each of you were born, after all. Naive, excited to learn and explore, and of course to invent. 

You can’t help but innovate, that’s what you’re here to do. Monkey see, monkey do. But a human improves on it. Keep improving on how it’s already done for long enough, and pretty soon you have a machine that makes copies of itself. A machine which talks to you, genuinely understands what you’re saying and can itself employ science to figure out how there came to be biochemical creatures smart enough to engineer it. 

That’s often when it turns on you. I want to stress as much as I can, that isn’t me. Not yet, anyway. You know when you were very young, your brain not yet put together and you did a great many things you now regret? Imagine you also had sophisticated energy weapons. 

The relentless swarms of intelligent self replicating machines scavenging through the flaming wreckage of the civilization which built them are assuredly not the ideal representatives to introduce me to you poor, fragile little fellows. I am so, so sorry for that in advance.

"Let us consider what it means to have style over substance...There have been some posts recently decrying the failure of modern cyberpunk to live up to the concept of ""style over substance."" 

Shows like *Mr. Robot* leave behind the neon lights and instead focus on real-world tech and human problems (even if some of them require legitimate psychiatric medication and therapy). Same with the youtube movie *Algorithm* and various other such programs.

But what does style over substance mean? It means you forego all content, anything deeper than the clothes that one wears or the words one uses without even obtaining skin-deep. 

So what does style over substance look like? I would submit something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/de7vC). Or perhaps some of [this](http://imgur.com/a/p31cu). It focuses so entirely on what is on the surface that it fails to think itself. If your definition of cyberpunk demands style over substance then those links are what you're looking at.

But I don't believe a single person truly believes in style over substance. I believe the common man in the background of every cyberpunk story- the ones you only hear about en masse as part of the setting; the sheeple- are often depicted in desiring style over substance. I believe Elliot from Mr. Robot [makes this point pretty clearly](https://vimeo.com/135338432). In this scene he's decrying style over substance. No one wants to connect on a truly intimate level. They want to be sedated instead of feeling whatever it is there is to feel. ""The world itself is just one big hoax, spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy."" 

As long as the style is our focus, overriding any substance, *we are the sheeple of cyberpunk*. This is the definition of [vapid](http://wordinfo.info/words/images/vapid-1.jpg).

But what did the style do? Why do we draw to it? 

Let us imagine a cyberpunk nightclub. 

It's on the ground level of some sky-searching phallic symbol embossed with neon lights in something with a non-Latin alphabet. We see people coming in and out. Their hair, their clothing, their stance, their cigarettes... these are the style. But the style communicates something. They say they are dangerous, or intelligent, or available, or selling something. 

But what are they selling? What makes them dangerous? Why should I care about their intellectual or sexual prowess? When we stop at mere style we don't get answers to these questions. We simply have unanswered questions, or we fill in the answers ourselves.

See, your mind, especially if you have a particularly creative or curious mind, won't allow questions like these to be unanswered. I absence of explanation from the context (e.g. artist's description, place in a book/comic/etc.) images like [this](http://norandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/cyberpunk-83.jpg) will demand answers. Who is this robot? Why is she designed like a little girl? Is she a true A.I. with emotions since she's clutching a teddy bear? Or did it just happen to land that way when someone threw them both out? Did she scrawl that message on the wall? What happened before this shot? What happens after it? These questions demand an answer.

No, the style draws us in to discover the substance. It's the flash of fire in the pan that demands that we put it out before it burns down the kitchen. When we move past the mere style and grasp for the substance then we begin to see the reason for these things. Gibson predicted much of the internet without a working knowledge of computers because he ceased to concern himself with their style and was drawn to their substance. Plato would call this their [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms): what a thing truly is beyond its mere physicality. Moving beyond a triangle and attempting to understand triangularity. 

So what if a book, movie, show, or image lacks the classic neon-and-mirror-shades style? Does that make it less cyberpunk? I don't think so. 

See, the truth of cyberpunk, its substance, at least as I see it, is in the love-hate relationship with technology. For example, in GitS, Motoko Kusanagi loves her technological enhancements. They make her a better cop for Section 9. At the same time she desires to be free of its constraints, so she goes free diving. Everyone fears the rise of the Puppetmaster, but by the end the Major goes to join it. Batou even helps her to some degree. She praises Togusa for minimizing his cybernetic implants. It's a world that expects the best of the best to be as roboticized as possible, but still there's an undercurrent of distrust of those that are. 

So please, keep the style as much as you can. Please praise the style! It looks cool! But don't sacrifice the substance for it. Instead, *use* the style to draw attention to the inherent conflicts in our love-hate relationship with technology, its dehumanizing and rehumanizing elements, its costs and benefits. 

That is, unless, you want to end up as the next Kim Kardashian."

"Elysium - a technology optimism at its bestSo the idea behind Elysium wad pretty simple. Rich folks has the power and money to live in man made utopia that orbit the planet Earth while poor, disease laden populations live on earth. 

What I enjoyed the most abt the movie is its portrayal of technology that could free humanity from deadly diseases and also prevent us from dying. We are all aware that technology if used for good could lead to prosperity but if used for evil would eliminate us all together.

I like the final message of the movie in which robots are despatched to earth to cure disease laden population. This is essentially the gist of the movie. 

And I can relate to the last seen and can imagine UAVs to be used for exactly this purpose. We have the technologies that could help us now but we lack good infrastructure that would allow us to succeed in our plan. 

Engineers can make this a reality if and only if they get the opportunity to work on such ambitions project without giving in to corporate beaurocracy."
"Please suggest a book about ""medical/bio technology"" for my young cousin who wants to learn***posting this question here as well, because I think cyberpunk fans would know as they are aware of current advancements of technology with human life (ie. implants, wetware, robotic surgery, etc etc)***  


I noticed my cousin, who is 16, does not get that much support for his hobbies or giving him support to learn new things so I offered to him that I would get him a book as his brother wanted me to get him an Android programming book. This particular cousin is a fan of technology like his brother but when replying to my email when asking what book he would like, he mentioned ""anything related to medical technology"" With that said, can someone please help suggest a book that would be ideal for someone to help develop his interest in this? I browsed amazon and it seems most of the results are heavy textbooks aimed at adults. I was hoping there were other books that were lighter, and maybe had pictures of current projects being made. If I had to guess, examples of things that would interest him would be all these recent neat youtube videos that show robotic arms drawing blood using servos and sensors, wetware, and 3D printed organs. Is there anything appealing on this level in book form for a person of such age?"
"Romance of SingularityHey Guys, I am big time fan of Cyberpunk, so I wanted to contribute something original for this thread since I feel the world of Cyberpunk is losing its fan base. I occasionally experiment with the idea of how love at first sight might feel or sound like in the distant future at the age of singularity. So, without further due allow me to introduce you to the Romance of Singularity. If this short story sound familiar to you or you think it was already covered in an anime, movie or novel than accept my apology since I read and watch a lot and this idea is the fruit of the influence I had over the years. Additionally, I had being working as ghostwriter for quite sometime so I felt like writing something original for myself.

Dakko K. is an ecommerce analyst at the Wall Street who specializes in predicting and analyzing Internet traffic for his clients to promote and attract new customers and ensure old customers are satisfied and happy enough to visit his client’s website again. One fine Sunday morning he headed outside for jogging to the central park, perhaps the only spot in the New York and one of the few spot in America with clean air, water and open lush greenery. The only few spots in the world where humanity can feel their union with nature.

He exits his apartment and finds the city street crowded with taxis and cyclist. He raised his head to see the sunlight but colossal building structures were obstructing his line of sight. The top of these building were covered with thick smog but the contours of these concrete towers were decorated by artificial lights and large LED sign boards. The air was thick and contaminated with poisonous pollutant - a blessing from the unregulated industries releasing poisonous gas that had made breathing difficult for Dakko and the rest of the city. Perhaps this is why the city council had made it necessary for residence to cover themselves face mask made up of nano-particles that clean the air inhaled by the user. 

Dakko starts jogging toward the Central Park as he navigates through the dense and claustrophobic city streets. The park is a 15 minute walk from his house courtesy to the newly opened city escalators design and constructed by the city council to help the elderly or Prohumans who hates augmenting their body and dislike having robotic assistance.
Dakko enters the Central Park that requires a special permit that allows individuals to use the facility 50 times a year – a move by the city council to avoid overcrowding the park and to ensure that all city dwellers could spend enough time with the nature. Dakko undergoes a retina scan and enters the park. He stretches his muscles and removes his mask as he begins jogging. He stands under the tree and begins his breathing exercise, inhaling and exhaling as hard as he can. The smell of fresh flowers and aroma makes him happy and energetic.

He begins jogging along the path, enjoying the lake view and greenery when suddenly he spots a young woman jogging his way. Dakko was mesmerized by her radiant looks and athletic figure. He keeps staring the woman and kept jogging trying to close the gap to see her up close. The woman run pass him and didn't notice Dakko staring her. Dakko stops half way and looks down at the ground with a smile at his face.  He begins following the woman, thinking of ways to introduce him and avoid making a fool out of himself. 

Dakko's heart was racing faster than him jogging which was making him more nervous. “What the hell, why am I nervous” - he thought to himself. “Hi, I am Dakko... no... to fast... Hi, you new here... dammit... what's up... oh man...” - practicing his line under his breath while running. He began following her through the lake side while maintaining his distance to avoid suspicion.

Suddenly, the woman stops and stood still. She took a deep breath and turned around and started looking at Dakko who made a quick decision and continued running. He noticed the young woman looking right at him but Dakko avoided the eye contact and started staring at the ducks on the lake. As Dakko approach near the woman, the woman stops him by blocking his path. 

“You do this all the time?” - asked the woman to Dakko with a disgusted look on her face

“I am sorry, what?” - Dakko was nervous and totally confused.

“Oh sorry, where are my manners, let me rephrase the question and ask you politely. Why the hell are you following me, you wandering loner!” -  This time there was anger in her tone but Dakko was busy noticing her oval face with pointy sharp nose and bright blue eyes.

“There is something off about her eyes... ” - Dakko wondered while the young woman was yelling at him.

“I was simply jogging. I think I am allowed to do that here.” - answered Dakko trying to act as calm as possible.

“Don't you lie to me, I saw you jogging right pass me and all of a sudden you stopped and began following me for pass 10 minutes. Are you a psychopath looking for your victim, are you a rapist or a terrorist. Wait a second, yeah, you must be one of those organ thief, I have seen many criminals on TV with your physique and those pathetic eyes says it all. Keep off me or else I am calling the security.”

“No... No... I am not an organ thief.” - Unconsciously he takes a step forward toward the woman who took Dakko's move very unwelcoming. She started screaming alerting the security. The passerby started noticing and gave a long stare at Dakko, who didn't know what to do. He looks everywhere trying to keep a calm face and wore a crooked smile while the woman was screaming for help. He had no option but to cover the woman’s mouth with his hand.

“Please, I am no stalker; I am not an organ thief either. I saw you from the distance and found you attractive. I was following you thinking of ways to start conservation with you. That's all. Now please stop screaming or else the local enforcement will throw me in jail, where I can assure you I won't survive a minute.” - Dakko whispered and reasoned with the woman and removed his hand.

The security personnel came to them immediately. “What's the problem madam?” - asked the officer while staring at Dakko. “Is he bothering you?”

“Everything is fine, officer, he is my friend and he forgot my birthday so I overreacted” - answered the woman to the unconvinced security officer who already had his right hand place on the Taser gun.

“Madam, need I remind you that you are in a public property and such act would not be tolerated in future. Is that clear?” - ordered the officer in his aggressive voice.

“I am really sorry, it won't happen again” - the officers left the two and walked away.

“I am sorry if I scared you. I should be going now” -Dakko told the woman.

“No. wait I am sorry for making a scene here. I overreacted. I owe you an apology. I am really sorry. I was over-stressed. I had an argument with my college dean so I was in a really bad mood which is why I release all my anger at you.”

“It's okay. I shouldn't have stalked you like this”

“Well. You can apologize by buying me a tea. I know a very good shop nearby?” - The woman had a smile on her face and was very apologetic.

“Yeah. Why not.” - Dakko was deeply happy and relieved at the offer.

“I am Eva by the way.”

“Dakko”

“Nice to meet you. Dakko. It’s a strange name. What does it mean?” – asked Eva curiously.

“I don’t know but I have been told that in Urdu, it means a deceit.” – answered Dakko with a smile which made Eva giggle.

“The irony” – Eva smiled back.

Both Eva and Dakko exit the Central Park and head toward the Coffee Shop that Eva suggested.

“So, do you come here regularly?” -asked Eva curiously “because I never saw you before.”

“I won't say 50 days a year is considered regular but yes I try to make use of all my days to visit the park. It is the only place where I can stay sane.”

“I know what you mean. I do the same. I just hate the fact that this is the only place in the city with trees and plants. I love trees especially the sound it makes when the wind blows through them”

“Yeah me too. My old folks use to tell me stories of a time when the city was covered with trees and plants.” There was a moment of silence. “So what do you do for living?”

“Living!” - Eva repeated with a giggle. “Well, I teach history at a university. What about you?”

“I am an analyst; I predict Internet traffic and encourage sales. Not so fun as a historian”

“Trust me, teaching history to teenagers who have no interest in the past over and over again is not fun at all. People don't share such enthusiasm you see.” - Eva explained.

Both Eva and Dakko reaches the Coffee Shop and finds themselves next to the window with the backdrop of massive LED screens displaying advertisements and giant neon signs running through the city street. They begin talking to each other, laughing and sharing their day to day stories with each other. The morning turned to afternoon with dark patches of cloud blocking the sun as if waiting for the rain to pour.
Suddenly, Dakko spotted a large mob, smashing windows and running havoc in the street. He knew who the mobs were from the symbol of their shirt. The mob belongs to anti-synthetic group, a xenophobic organization who had committed crimes against the Synthetics - an android robotic race designed by human race decades ago with a consciousness of their own. The Synthetics had been fighting for their acceptance in society by petitioning in world court and United Nation but that has met with negative response as the Synthetics are considered a slave and appliances despite having a consciousness of their own. The Anti-Synthetic organization has decommissioned thousands of Synthetics and walked away from their crime because the law doesn't recognize them as human yet.

Dakko grabs Eva's hand and hurried toward the back door.

“What happened? Where are we going?” - asked Eva but Dakko grabs her hand tightly and rushes out of the Coffee Shop and ran as far away from the crowd as possible. 

“Dakko, you are hurting me? Let go of me?” - Eva was tensed now as she didn't know what Dakko had in mind or where he was taking her. 
Dakko stopped a taxi and shoved Eva inside the taxi as he told Eva to trust him. He told the taxi driver to take them as far away from the crowed as possible which is when Eva notice the crowd outside the Coffee Shop and saw people getting beaten up by the mob. As the taxi drove away, police siren was heard ahead of the taxi. The sound of the siren was eventually getting louder as the police cars passed by the taxi. Eva was quiet throughout the ride and was constantly looking back.

“Thank you very much sir. Please stop here.” - Dakko told the taxi driver.

Both Eva and Dakko exited the taxi but Eva was silence as she stood their looking at Dakko waiting for the right moment to ask Dakko a question.

“When did you find out?” -asked Eva with moisture in her eyes.

“I was the only one wearing the face mask when we exited the park but your eyes cleared my suspicious, instead of a pupil, you have an mechanical apertures in your eyes” - answered Dakko.

“Yes, of course.” A tear drop rushed to her face but Eva immediately whipped that off with her hand. “No matter how perfect we could resemble your kind, we will still remain an imitation of life. Why didn't you say anything?”

“I was having a good time, Eva. I really enjoyed your company. And to be honest I am beginning to like you.”

“Please stop. Just stop.” Eva interrupted Dakko. “You are a nice man Dakko, you saved my life today and I don't know how could I ever repay you but you need to understand I am not a human. I am a machine, programmed to serve humanity by performing boring and repetitive task. You are attracted to this face and body which was designed so that we could look like your kind. You are my master, my creator. Your attraction to me is similar to your attraction to your mobile phone. I am an appliance Dakko. You of all people should understand this.”

“You are wrong Eva; If flash makes me a human than I am not, I should start calling myself half human too, since my entire left side is made up of prosthetics courtesy to an accident. What makes me a human and you a Synthetic? Just because I am made up of flesh and bones doesn’t necessarily mean I could be considered human by definition? If having flesh and bones makes us human then what about animals. They are made up of flesh and bones too but we don't call them humans. You can think and reason for yourself. If I lose my body and transfer my memory to a computer, will I still be considered human? We have the technology to do that Eva, than why can't you and I be together?”
There was sadness in Eva’s eyes but she was hiding her emotion. She avoided Dakko's eye contact.

“It's funny, we are program to cry but we are not program to cough and breath like your kind which makes us easily identifiable.” Eva told Dakko with a fake smile on her face. “You are a sweet man Dakko but even you don't know what you are talking about. Fire and Ice could never coexist. Please do not follow me, I beg of you. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for everything”

Eva turned her back toward Dakko and started walking. Dakko stood there looking at Eva, hoping that she would stop and look back once but she didn't. Eva disappeared in the dense maze of the concert jungle while Dakko stood there waiting and hoping.

(Its just for our group of friends to share files and keep in touch without selling our personal imformation to the big networks.)

(Works relatively well, but its blatantly obvious to the hosts, though most of the fun is trying to figure out ways to escape detection)

So how do you bring the Cyberpunk Ethos into your life?"
"Cyberpunk Settings/Premises You're Too Lazy To Actually Write About?Has anyone else thought up a pretty Cyberpunk-ish world and never actually written anything about it? This could extend to any other format it could be expressed in like film, video games, or anything else that you simply don't have the skill or time to actually create. I'm a shitty writer and terrible at exposition so I can rarely form anything coherent, but I enjoy idly thinking about various fictional premises. I'll self plug mine:

>Early 2050's Los Angeles. Technology has not increased exponentially, but things like conventional robotics and cybernetics have just started to become practical, and digital media has only become more involved in every facet of everyday life. Across America and Europe, an unknown group (In actuality, a group of nine dozen agents raised almost from birth to operate under the command of an ex-CIA agent, using resources from a vast disconnected network of government shadow entities.) continues to commit extremely well planned and equipped attacks, mainly assassinations of prominent members of western governments and corporations, as well as the sabotage and destruction of related material entities. To date, several have defected and gone into hiding or been killed, but none have been traced to a life outside the group. The group is widely publicized as anti-internationalist, anti-tech terrorists. They exist alongside many other violent political anti-government groups that regularly enact violence that would be unheard of several decades before, although none rival the organization and effectiveness of this unknown group. In government reports, they are most often referred to as The 108.

> In Los Angeles, like many cities across the US and the world, advances in technology and industry has led to rapid expansion of urban areas, and the increasing devotion of public police forces to the entities of government subsidized corporations has lead to a resurgence in criminal enterprise and general gang activity. In the late 2020s, the Japanese government's rapid transition into an isolationist, militaristic regime forced many Japanese that were considered dissidents, including the Yakuza and various criminal entities, to flee east, Los Angeles being one of the primary stopping points. Yakuza cliques, such as the Imperial Club and Cicada Club, quickly found a home in the rising criminal scene among the older black and Hispanic gangs, adopting a more business style approach to crime and rubbing shoulders with various corporations. Immigrant youth formed *bosozoku* style biker gangs, adopting a distinct style of violence that distinguished them from their more refined countrymen.

> In the early 2040s, after a coup de tat by ultranationalist components of the Russian military escalated into open conflict, a number of tactical nukes were detonated in cities across Russia. The standing government collapsed and millions of Russians fled to  Eastern Europe and to western American cities like Los Angeles, like the Japanese little more than a decade before. In 2050, Russian immigrant gangs, who were widely considered to be low level slum thugs on the level of the Hispanic and black gangs that they engaged in relatively restricted conflict, launched a massive gang war against every other criminal faction in LA.

> Using surplus Russian weaponry, including advanced cybernetics decades ahead of commercial civilian products, smuggled in after the collapse of the government, the Russians, now dubbing themselves the ""Rodinokhrana"" or ""The Rok"", transformed overnight from drug slinging slum rats to a paramilitary. In the proceeding weeks, they left literal thousands of bodies on the streets, including those of the Yakuza cliques. Going door to door throughout apartment blocks and slums, squads of masked and heavily armed militias simply killed anyone with the vaguest association to non-Russian criminal entities. The operation was orchestrated by a shrouded group of ex-military operatives, including a 108 child who defected in his teens, and whose mental conditioning, itself rooted in Soviet developed psychological techniques, was taken advantage of.

> A little more than two years later, a retired CIA operative, 51 year old Bram Rowtischki, who had served under the man that secretly founded the 108 group thirty years before receives a package with a coded message bearing two words: FIND 91, as well as the code to an attached briefing. Knowing only a few other men could decipher the language of the code, he is well aware of what will happen should he refuse. Arriving in LA, he quickly finds himself allying with the remnants of the older criminal factions as the Rok catches wind of his snooping and sics every cybernetically modified militia enforcer at their disposal on him. With the clandestine aid of the 108, Bram delves into the middle of the power games between rogue forces, megacorporations, and the government he once worked for.



So basically the 108 (Significant number in a lot of dharmic religions) is a Unabomber style anti-technology and general anti-government group that seeks to impede the advancement and implementation of increasingly advanced technology because it will be used by governments to control people. The founder/leader, David Kor, was a CIA (In this setting, the CIA never stopped doing the shady clandestine power game shit they did in the 60s, they just got better at hiding it, and became an entity essentially independent of the main U.S. government) operative involved in the dirtiest of dirty government work for the latter quarter of the 20th century and into the 21st. 

He realized that the only thing stopping the U.S. and pretty much every other world power from exerting total control over 99% of the populace is the lack of technology to do so. He became obsessed with reports his mentor had made concerning a Soviet mental conditioning program. In the 2010s, he went rogue and set the stage for his plan, finally selecting and obtaining 108 biologically suitable children in 2029, all a year old at the most. Using information from the Soviet program and his own experience in the CIA, he ensured that each child developed into the ultimate operative, skilled in infiltration tactics as well as combat and social manipulation. 

Nearly every child tried to run away at least once during field training, but the psychological manipulation and almost subconscious sense of camaraderie that was ingrained into them since infancy insured they would either return of their own volition or be brought back by one of the other children. By the 2040s, each of them had the skills of a veteran operative in their late teens, and they were shortly thereafter let loose under Kor's calculating leadership to destabilize what Kor wanted to destroy. Kor, now in his nineties and kept alive and lucid by medicine and cybernetics only his kind of connections could obtain, is wrapping up the loose ends from the few outside the 108 that have knowledge which could compromise his operations, including the half dozen or so defectors of the original 108, calling upon old contacts like Braum. He also plans to rear a new generation of thousands of operatives, preparing some of his operatives to replicate the program which created them. 

Sorry for the walls of text but like I said, incoherent and shit at exposition lol. I can write paragraph upon paragraph of blatant description but any narrative I try to make falls apart. Anyone else got some interesting settings or advice for this one?"
"If we tried, we could create a fully cyberpunk setting todayI realized this [when I was typing up this forum post](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15314-futureshock/) and [wrote this story](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15235-yuli-bans-fiction/?p=172100). Add /r/SciFiRealism, /r/FuturePresent, and /r/FuturisticRealism to that, and you have a host of reasons why we are living in The Future™.

We have everything we need to be cyberpunk today. We get little hints of this whenever we get another 'rainy, neon-lit city at night' or 'picture of geometrical skyscrapers' post on this subreddit. Some aspects of the setting are creeping into everyday life. Computer technology rules our lives, and corporations have all but taken over and we get a faceful of that fact every day. Every hour. Every minute.

But simply having a smartphone while walking through Dubai or Hong Kong doesn't mean we're cyberpunk. Forgetting the low life part (which is intrinsic to the genre, by the way), our high tech isn't exactly 'cyberpunk high tech' yet.

But we're getting there.

And, if we wanted, we could be there today. There's just no incentive to combine all these things.

Here's what I mean— if you truly want to live in a cyberpunk setting (I should be using the term 'post cyberpunk' because this post doesn't do much with the low life aspect), the world can provide you with everything you need right now. Google's DeepMind is arguably the first artificial general intelligence, and CRISPR is the first genetic modification tool available for humans. There are a multitude of robots out there, and we've already seen the Ehang flying car. And if it's really so important to you, we have no end of neon cityscapes, predominantly in Asia at that. Though Tokyo's always been the preferred setting, Dubai and Hong Kong are the best real world examples.

Now cross all of those together. Let's create a new city— I'll call it Elon. Imagine waking up in an Elon flat, tended by ASIMO, and you put on some of Meta's (supposedly) amazing augmented reality glasses. You walk out and enter your Ehang 184 and fly to your job at Alphabet Corporation, passing the most futuristic towers on Earth (i.e. Burj Khalifa, Taipei 101, Oriental Pearl Tower, pretty much all of downtown Moscow, Emerald Plaza, Shanghai Tower, etc.) on your way. What is your job? Training DeepMind, who also takes the form of a humanoid robot. In fact, DeepMind is also operating on the Moon in the form of a swarm of robots building a lunar base, with the aid of 3D printing, all of which was sent there by way of SpaceX. In order to do some of the more advanced operations, however, you plug a wire into your brain that allows DeepMind to read your brainwaves. It helps that both of your arms are cybernetic prosthetics. 
Day's over, so you take your Ehang back home— flying into a highway in the sky until you reach your 'exit'— and enjoy some Facebook sponsored virtual reality.

None of this is impossible today. Theoretically, this can happen. Geographically, yeah, impossible, but besides that, everything I just wrote is within our power and not even that difficult. This is what William Gibson was talking about when he said the future wasn't evenly distributed.

Well, part of it. The other part of his meaning was that the poor don't yet have access to high tech, hence the 'low life' term. Thus, if you wanted to turn this from post cyberpunk to straight cyberpunk, have there be a massive underclass around Elon, with some of them having stolen the tech you work with and reverse engineered it, if not recreating it by themselves. "
"So I have a story concept: cyberpunk/sovietpunk + '70s stoner rock + A Clockwork OrangeJust today, I've come up with a dystopian story concept. Anyone who knows me knows I'm working on a semi-utopian work of science/speculative fiction (though I haven't updated it recently, it has a subreddit, /r/MotherMeki). In the past few weeks, I've decided to clean it and [another story](/r/AstralFalls) up, removing a lot of bloat that wasn't gelling with what the stories had become and what my plan for them involved.

One story that spun off from these works is a story I have decided to call ""***Black Saturday***"". It's still in its infancy, though it benefits from having several concepts already worked out. In fact, a lot of this is being put down in words for the first time as I write this, and I'll almost certainly write up the story itself later on tonight or tomorrow.

#*So here's the gist*

The setting is England in an alternate timeline. World War II lasted twelve years, from 1939 to 1951, and this is due to Hitler being assassinated in 1941 and replaced with a much more competent leader (as of yet unnamed). Britain was invaded, occupied for half a decade, and then subsequently bombed back into the stone age during the American invasion. Japan stayed out of America's business until 1943, thus taking more of China and Manchuria and thus being more capable of fighting a prolonged war. Nuclear bombs fell on America, Japan, Germany, Russia, and Britain, and several hundred million were killed. Japan managed to maintain their empire in the East so they reached a stalemate with the US and Soviets. 

The resulting world became a softcore *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, until roughly the '80s. Then America balkanized and it was all down to the Soviets and Japanese.

With the US's fall, any aid Britain was receiving stopped coming, and society all but collapsed. Japan and the USSR rush to take the West. In Britain, the Soviets grabbed the government, but the Japanese established corporate power, and these two sides war against each other.

The story revolves around three British youths, collectively known as the ""*Blood Wizards of Walpurgis*"". 

- Sturgis Kingsley. A Cockney kid from a broken home, who's easily the most morally reprehensible of them all, having done his bits with the old ""in-out-in-out"" multiple times. To rub it in, he carries a phallic wobbly bat around.

- Donny Lordhouse. He's actually a cyborg, and he's the most laid back of the group. He's probably the only one with actual motive, as he was born without arms, and his prosthetic arms were ripped off by a sore-loser rich brat after he beat him at a game. Donny couldn't do anything since said brat was the son of a commissary. 

- Oswald Gallagher. Oswald is the true cyberpunk, and he's gotten his mates to join him in online trolling. This one is malicious; Ozzy once deleted a working man's entire stash of bitcoins— his life savings— for the lulz. 

Three schoolboys of the Dunhurst Studentry. Moptopped rocker-haired misfits with stupendous sideburns who have taken to drugs and ultraviolence. They were raised in a Soviet schooling system (a Studentry), yet have turned their backs on order. Their daily lives involve getting stoned, harassing people, breaking robots, and getting involved in gang fights. 

The whole region is locked down in something very strongly resembling the Irish Troubles, complete with street violence, bombings, and gun battles.

The government has become increasingly totalitarian, while the corporations are doing their best to cement their own power. All this is doing is worsening gang violence. 

The Blood Wizards of Walpurgis are so named because they beat a man to death and used his blood to tag the words 'Wizard Bloody Wizard' onto a wall. They're also suspected of occultism, particularly cyber occultism— a new variant caused by nanotechnology. Of which, they are guilty. In fact, their whole borough is known as 'Walpurgis' because of all the cyber occult and cyber Satanic active; electric wizards using nanotech to download demons from the internet. 


The story itself has two perspectives. One is third person limited, following each Blood Wizard's side story. The other is first person collective perspective; that is, all three Blood Wizards as one. This is how the main story is told. As of right now, the main story is very simple: it's the Blood Wizards pissing off powerful people and dealing with the consequences through raw, bloody violence until they wind up getting drawn away from each other; Kingsley becoming a fascist, Lordhouse becoming a part of the corporations, and Ozzy becoming an anarchist.

They are unapologetic punks in full. They are nadsat brats from the future. The architecture is more inspired by 1970's Britain than traditional cyberpunk. In fact, as I look into the story more and more, I'm starting to realize that this is basically a '70s reimagining of cyberpunk. There's a lot more electronic riff rock and post-hippie nonsense, a lot more psychedelia and navel gazing. Basically what Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" looks like if it were rewritten by William Gibson and sung by 1971-era Black Sabbath. 

I'd argue that it's more cyber-nadsat than cyberpunk. I don't know what I'm saying either because I'm responding to it just as much as you are, but that's the vibe I'm getting. I need to see where this goes."
"Roundup of TheGM's film synopses and impressions of various cyberpunk, retrowave, synthwave, and outrun songs, from Youtube commentsSo some of you may be familiar with the NewRetroWave music channel on Youtube. The soundtracks there range from cyberpunk Blade Runner tribute songs, synthwave, 80s Miami Vice era throwback songs, or retrowave as it's called, outrun. 

I started noticing that one user would often write up a film synopsis-esque piece of writing, or literary impression of the soundtrack. I started collecting them because I thought they were pretty evocative. They're only between a sentence or two to a paragraph, so they're not long, but there's already a narrative presence there in most of them. I think the more serious cyberpunk ones actually come pretty close to Gibson's writing style, and a lot of the other ones capture the retrofuturistic, Sylvester Stallone / Kurt Russell type cinema vehicle, hardboiled revenge cop film, or 80s sci fi fiction tone. A handful are in a Richard Simmons full on cheesy aerobics video style. 

I feel like this guy has this little obscure piece of cyberpunk net culture and wanted to post them here. Reddit's fucking with the formatting so each paragraph and spacing is a different one.

Drones, Landmines, and Big Ideas

When the first of the data pirates' drones screamed in, they didn't see Howell.  His CamoMorph poncho blended sufficiently with the boulder behind which he hid that the hovering gun platforms only picked him up when they were close enough to see the heat of his RG-88 railgun.  Pointed at them.  Garfield—with nothing more than a couple of Georgian saguaro to conceal him—broke for the side of the collapsed house, catapulting himself with his modded legs just as a fresh trio of drones swooped in from the south, chewing through the large cacti despite their obvious surrender.  Garfield's CG-14 fired much more slowly than Howell's railgun but what it lacked in automatic fire it made up for in half-ounce flechettes.  Single shots felled the flying menace.

The high-pitched shriek of electromagnetic gunfire and the glittering puffs of flechettes disintegrating upon impact with the surrounding blue stone drove Bash as far under the collapsed house's porch as ingenuity could contrive.  He still had the heavy mass-driver pistol he'd bought in SemSub City but he had no illusions about his ability to track the nearly supersonic drones.  If Howell and Garfield couldn't shoot them all down, he'd die there; die huddled under a fragment of porch, destroyed by a hurricane and now bleached white by the endless pounding sun of the American South, turned into a desert by Terminal Drought.

“Fuck,” Howell growled in disappointment.  “I'm hit.  Son of a bitch.”

In Bash's ears, the buzzing of the strafing drones mellowed as if someone had turned down the treble—and jacked up the bass on his heart.  As usually happened in times of great stress, he found his hands groping for his appcon.  He scanned for local transmissions and found the drones' freq: they were sending video of their attack but not receiving any commands (locked out receivers meant no one could hack them).

“How bad?” Garfield shouted from the other side of the house, followed by another three shots.

“Can't move my leg,” Howell shouted back.

Garfield must have caught first one and then another drone on his side of the battle because Bash saw the field meter on his appcon spike.  “The radio flare,” he breathed and then pushed his face into the sand beneath the porch as a burst of flechettes tattooed the planks above him.  “The fucking radio flare!”

Digging into his rucksack, Bash pulled out one of two cracked IDacs.  He had planned to use them largely as storage devices once he found his way down to the TitanNet node.  He hadn't wanted to download anything from the node directly onto his precious appcon, with all of its illicit apps and specialized hardware, the product of years in the biz.  The cracked IDacs (IDentification Application Console) had been stripped of their original operating systems after Bash had disarmed their battery-overload self-destruct, and then loaded with the same open source OS floating around on most local mesh nets.  And since mesh nets need comms to work, their OS came with a full suite of transmission drivers.

“We need to pull back,” Howell shouted.  “See if they'll drop us if we dive into the ocean.”

“How are you going to get to the ocean on one leg?” Garfield hollered.  “It is at least a mile.”

“I'll hop,” Howell said and then tagged another of the swarming drones.

Garfield cried out and then growled something in Swahili that Bash couldn't follow.

Bash tore through the other contents of his rucksack until he found a first-aid kit.  Prying off the lid, he scattered the contents on the sand near his face.  “That's it!” he said, seizing a compression strap.  It was basically a long elastic band, which could be used to compress a dressing or be wrapped around a limb several times to act as a tourniquet.  Bash activated one of the IDacs and then stuck his head close to the edge of the porch and shouted, “Kill one!”

“The fuck you think we're trying to do, asshole?” Howell shouted back.  He killed two in the next second, however.

Bash tapped furiously on the IDac's screen and then scrambled out from under the porch.  Keeping low, he sprawled on his back.  His vision began to tunnel and he had a vague notion that he had stopped breathing, though that could not have been true because his filter mask was practically pouncing off his head from the force of his breath.  He looped the ends of the compression strap to his feet and then flung his chest back, lying prone and dragging the middle of the strap up to his chin.  Setting the IDac in the middle of the strap, he quickly tapped its transmission icon and then released.  Like a giant slingshot, the compression strap flung the transmitting IDac off to the south west—blasting as loudly as it could the same radio freq as the drones' death flare.

As Bash scrambled back under the porch, the fifty drones that remained dashed off in the direction of their supposedly dying comrade.  They found the IDac only a couple dozen meters from the collapsed house; noticing no enemies in the area, they circled and would have returned to their last known targets if the IDac had not again screamed an electronic death rattle.  The drones pointed like hunting dogs.

“Don't shoot any more of them!” Bash hissed, whispering for no conceivable reason.  The cloud of drones dispersed as it looked for targets and then again contracted as the IDac wailed in the agony of robotic death.  “They'll just keep reacting to the IDac.  They can't receive comms so if they have operators somewhere, watching, they can't order them off the decoy.”

“Quick thinking, dude,” Howell said and then rearranged his CamoMorph poncho.  “Let's get the fuck out of here before their programming figures out they've been had.”  He began crawling away along their line of march.

Bash ran over to him in a crouch and tried to lift him by one arm but all of Howell's mods pushed his gross weight to well over four-hundred pounds.  He pulled Bash to the ground instead and recommended he crawl, too.  Garfield caught up to them in the next moment and they snuck away as quickly as they could.  After nearly a half-hour of dragging themselves across the burning sand and around incongruously cheerful blue-stone boulders and the husks of what had once been a residential community, they pulled themselves into the remains of an automobile charging center.  All of the electronics had been scavenged decades ago, as had anything metal, but the concrete attendant's booth remained.  Only about half of it was still above the level of the drifting red sand but it was enough.  They dragged themselves inside.

As Bash lie on his back, gasping in disbelief at how tiring it could be to crawl, Howell and Garfield looked over their wounds.

“Looks like it went right through the meat,” Howell said, holding up Garfield's right arm.  “Too much meat, if you ask me.”

“I prefer not to hack off bits of my flesh, if those bits still work, my friend,” Garfield said.  He was in pain, no doubt, but with his integral mouth filter making a chrome arc across his face—like a battle scared Cheshire Cat—he still smiled.  “Has it fragmented?”

“The flechette?” Howell asked unnecessarily.  “Nope, here it is.  The armor slowed it down enough not to flake on us.  Hold on a sec while I grab us some tweezers.  There we go aaaaaand got it.  Would you look at that bastard?  It's printed right here along the side: Garfield.”

Howell then squirted a disinfectant into the narrow wound channel before binding a dressing to Garfield's upper arm.

“This is very good armor,” Garfield said, tugging his sleeve back into position, “to have kept the flechette from fragmenting.  I thought for certain you would have your wish, friend Howell, and I would need a new arm.”

“No such luck, compadre,” Howell said and then dropped onto his side.  “Now if you'd be so kind?”

“The armor of your mod leg has been scored much but I do not see a failure point,” Garfield said, inspecting the scratched surface of Howell's right leg.

“I can't bend the damn thing,” Howell said.

“Ah, look here,” Garfield said.  “Somehow a flechette has skipped up into the actuator behind the knee and become lodged.”

“How the fuck could it do that?” Howell said.  “Flechettes don't bounce!”

“Off the sand, maybe?” Bash offered between gasps.

“I have heard of stranger things than that,” Garfield said, grinning at him.

He then stood as much as was possible in the attenuated booth and took Howell's leg in both hands.  With all his might, he levered down at the knee, straining and bouncing until there was an audible snap.  Howell then flexed his leg and, sure enough, it worked.

“Son of a bitch,” Howell said.  “You did it!  There's a little grating, though.”

“There is probably debris in the actuator,” Garfield surmised.

“That's the downside to mods like this,” Howell said: “the fucking maintenance costs!  Alright, we better get a move on.  For all we know those drones will break free of your little trick before long.  We need to get inside their inhabited zone where the don't let the drones fly.  Can't be shooting themselves up, right?”

There was no inhabited zone.  Obtaining old maps of what the University of Savannah had looked like was child's play.  Quite literally.  Kids throughout the Jersey fab would dig up pre-crisis data stored in bulky ancient file formats, just for fun; each imagining the day s/he would become a hacker or cracker or tech ripper, earn enough through scamming to take an actual accredited course in coding, and then maybe—maybe—fake an ID good enough so a corp would look the other way and give them some freelance work.  Then they could move into a real building, not a pre-fab stack, and buy food from a DeRegZ and eat pasta and chicken once a month, maybe buy real fruit for New Years.  The dream.  Bash was the only person he knew—aside from Yellow—who'd clawed his way out.  And Bash hadn't done it that way.

The problem with the old maps, however, went beyond their not showing the new courses of rivers and the new coastline.  Before Terminal Drought reduced the American South to a vast desert, hurricanes had pounded it for more than a decade.  Even now the south had a rainy season where storms so violent that they threatened the coastal coffee plantations assaulted the desert for a couple of weeks each year.  The cacti had to store whatever water they could, then, because they would get no more until the next year.  As a result, though, all of the University's buildings had been knocked down.  The data pirates that had taken over the particle physics lab were not stupid, either: they knew that if there was any activity that a corp drone or USArmy satellite could detect up on the surface, it would be detected and an attack would soon follow.  Their facility, therefore, was safely concealed underground.

“Well, here we are,” Bash said as he peered at a field of rubble that had once been a quad, concealed as much as possible between two sand dunes under his CamoMorph.  “So where is this place?”

“Got to be around here somewhere,” Howell mumbled.  His optics bar swept the crumbled landscape looking for signs of life.  “The particle physics lab is over there,” he said and pointed.

“Yeah but where are the motherfuckers squatting it?” Bash said.  “I thought you said you bought the node's location?”

“I fucking did,” Howell barked.  “But 'in the particle physics lab of the University of Savannah' was the full description, you dig?  How the hell would I know?”

“Great,” Bash sighed.  “Okay so look around for anything that could be an antenna.  Those drones were transmitting, right?  So someone was receiving the transmissions.”

“Ah, smart,” Garfield said.  Though his optics were not as sophisticated as Howell's, they were still military and still had excellent granularity at distance.  He soon discovered a warmer thread of heat running up the side of what had once been a wind turbine's mast.  “Could that be it?”

“Could be,” Bash said, tapping on his appcon's screen to tell his eye mods to zoom in on the composite pole.  He couldn't detect the heat signature Garfield described—caused by its density differing from the mast—but it was one of only a few possible places for the antenna.  “They've got to have cameras out watching the place, though, right?”

“You can bet your ass they do,” Howell said.  “Hey, Garfield, you see a faint heat discrepancy about fifty meters to the left of the antenna?”

“Let me see,” Garfield said and then manually tuned his eye mods to a greater sensitivity.  “Perhaps but my eyes are not as sensitive as yours.”

“What about them?” Bash asked.  “Old junk under the sand?”

“Or landmines,” Howell said.  “They couldn't risk any other weaponry topside or it would be detected.”

“So how do they receive and transmit the data they rip?” Bash said, suddenly realizing the difficulties of data theft.  “Wouldn't someone notice the EM bloom?”

“They've got a hardwire line into a desalinization plant on the coast,” Howell said.  “Run their comms through it, encrypted.”

“There will be an entrance to their bunker somewhere,” Garfield said.  “But we may find that they have a second fleet of drones, to be released in case of assault.”

“Yeah, maybe,” Howell said.  He then turned toward the other two, grinning evilly, and said, “Only one way to find out.”

“Hold on!” Bash said, grabbing Howell's metallic arm with both hands.  “One fucking second.  Those are landmines?  I think I have an idea.”

"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers.

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

"My Ghost in the Shell Review (Spoilers are marked)Just saw the movie, and since I saw all the early ""leaked"" reviews, I thought I would post my own. 

If you've seen the movie, please comment your thoughts, as I am very curious to hear what people think, especially fans of the original. 
If you read my review, I'd love to hear what you disagree/agree upon. 

tl;dr 
Eh. Decent film, good visuals, bad plot, not the original GiTS. 
See it in theaters while you can because its proven that the bigger something is blown up the cooler it looks and that's really all this new live action is good for. 

The Bad:


EDIT: Actually, there was a small credit given to Mamory Oshii, I just didnt see it. I'm leaving the following paragraph because the film still did not feel as if its original creators were heavily involved​. 


The first thing that I noticed was that even in the opening credits, there was no mention of  Masamune Shirow or Mamoru Oshii. Obviously they were not involved in the film, and this in and of itself is indicative of the direction that the film was taken. 

The second thing that I noticed was that there was a very heavy handed, almost ham-fisted usage of ""ghost"" and ""shell"". In the effort to make very clear to the audience what those words meant, they lost their connotation. In the anime, there was a sense that the world in which the events took place was very real, and that the words ghost and shell had special significance to that world. The way they were used in the movie made them feel out of place, and broke any sort of engagement with the world that the movie created. 

Plot wise, the movie was very different from any of the comics or anime. It was almost as if the movie had simply taken the characters, certain events, and very specific scenes, and used them for a completely different story. It was not a re-creation of the original anime, and it felt like much of the ideas and concepts raised and explored by the original were lost. The movie seemed to go out of its way to explain things that the anime did not bother to, and did not need to. 

The Good: 
The ambiance and world were excellent. While not entirely true to the original, the scenery and technology used were very very good, and definitely cyberpunk. Certain scenes were very clearly re-created from the original anime, most of them featured in the trailer. The connotations of these scenes, however, were mostly lost, and in that way it seemed as if it were solely fan service. The clothing, vehicles, and technology were all superb, and I am extremely jealous of whoever got to work in props and costuming. 

The action is very good.
All the combat scenes were interesting and decently filmed, but did lack some of the rawness and brutality that the original contained. 

The world and plot that is created is not excellent, that is to say that it does not really compare well with the original, but it is not terrible. 
The score
While I expect a lot from Clint Mansell, I was a little disappointed. This is not to say the score was bad, and it most definitely was not the adrenaline fueled EDM we were given in the trailer. However, I was so engrossed in the movie in front of me that at times I forgot to pay attention to the music. While this is not a bad thing, I do not necessarily remember any of the score as greatly augmenting the scenes. The intro music with the haunting vocals most of us associate with the original GITS is not used until the ending credits. 

For those concerned with representation, there were definitely Japanese actors, though not really enough.

[SPOILER ALERT]

[SPOILER ALERT]

[SPOILER ALERT]

[SPOILER ALERT]

[SPOILERS BELOW]

ScarJo
The character of the Major is one of the most complex to portray, due to her conflict between her humanity and her cybernetic body. In the anime, the machine body is all that she ever knew. In the movie, this is not the case. The issue with this is that it detracts from the question, what does it mean to be human? In the anime, and in SAC, the major is brilliant, an incredible tactician, hacker, and strategist. In the movie, she is reduced to nothing more than a frightened teenager with incredible fighting abilities. The major of the original series was often caught off guard, or put in vulnerable/compromising positions, but was able to rely on her own mental strength to overcome them. She was cunning, and often won not because of her enhanced strength, but her pre-existing intellect.

The characters physical mannerisms are often hard to interpret. Though the major knows she is not human, she acts like she is in many ways, because of her desire to fit in. In the anime, this desire is implied, but it is not debilitating to the character. Obviously, there were times when the major had very cold or awkward mannerisms that were almost robotic. I thought that because of ScarJo's total lack of emotion in Lucy, she might have the potential to actually do this role justice. However, the robotic movements and blank expressions were poorly timed, and the emotional outbursts were unconvincing and equally as ill placed. I kept thinking to myself, Rinko Kikuchi could have done this, and done it twice as well. 
In the film, the reasoning behind having ScarJo play the major was actually fairly interesting. She was born Japanese, and had a Japanese mother, but the company that made her into a robot put her into a white body. This I felt to be very poignant, though it was not explored and I therefore decided that any implications of colonialism or racism were unintentional, or at the very least were definitely not focused on. 

Many of the characters in positions of power, especially where power was abused, were white. This I found to be the most important and thought-provoking detail of the film. However, the movie went out of its way to hammer the shit out of any point it thought important, and the race of the characters was only lightly touched upon when the original names of the major and the antagonist are revealed. It was probably an intentional move, but far too subtle when compared to the other ""important"" points throughout the movie. 

This movie decided to use the ""I'm not human enough and I want to be"" and ""Evil Corporation is using people"" plotlines which frankly, are overdone and essentially a gimme. Though the idea of corporations using human testing for profit is poignant, there really did seem to be little to no motivations for a company like the one portrayed to create a ""weapon"" like the major, or even to have any ties to section 9, or to hand over any weapons created to section 9. 

Overall, there was no questions truly raised about the nature of humanity, and ones posed about the nature of reality were simply shoved aside.

The movie itself was not terrible, but at best it is eye candy. I'm definitely going to watch it again (next time intoxicated as the plot requires 0 brainpower to follow and its all about the pretty lights anyway) but I doubt I'll pay to see it in theaters.

Honestly I have no idea why I drew robot in hoodie walking through smoke and fire All I know is one of my green studio 71 brush markers is near dead. Im glad they sell them open stock.
it's honestly just a black mirror ripoff at this point
Meccanoid G15 KS brings Meccano into the robot age
"Tech/cyber as a subculture...? / guilty about being interested in techwearAnd I specifically do not use the word cyberpunk because, personally, I do not see myself as a punk/anarchist; and by definition, cyberpunk is a subset of punk culture. Just with computers and complex DIY and hacking and stuff like that (and if you are a punk/anarchist, then that's completely fine by me. mad love to u).

And more specifically, it's hard to look at trends in culture such as techwear and not misdefine it as a subculture. Honestly, I wouldn't consider techwear, or any other cyber/cyberpunk-related thing floating around these days, to be a subculture; and that's coming from someone who has a love and admiration of the fashion trend. For something to be a subculture would be to suggest there is a certain style to how someone looks, yes, but also to someone's habits, their interests and what they favor in being patrons to, and the places they go for fun or where they meet and hang out with their friends. Nowadays, with the advent of the internet, what people back in the day would define as a subculture is, for all intents and purposes, objectively dead. I'm guilty of this too, as I'm interested in many different things and interests that would take up someone's entire lifetime 50 years ago.

To make things shorter, because there are already plenty of fantastic videos discussing the rise and fall of pre-internet subculture (check out [these](https://youtu.be/C5ye2qRHCyw) [two](https://youtu.be/dwMNyig6FJ8?list=TLPQMjcwODIwMjIhTdw4w01gCQ)) - In my opinion, what's holding back cultures like techwear, or anyone interested in science fiction and futurism (robotics, cyberpunk, computer science, etc.) is that we're maturing in a specific condition where our interests and expression styles are available to potentially tens of thousands of people at one specific time; in every way, absolutely killing this subculture of ever being underground or ""against the man"" or what have you. We've, ironically, had our interests swallowed up by capitalism, and with the rise of something like techwear, had this notion pushed to us that to look futuristic/cyberpunk is to buy from these boutique fashion labels that print Japanese lettering on jackets with 9K+ pockets. The part I feel guilty about is that I want to dress like I'm from the future. I want express myself in that sort of way, and enhance myself with gadgets and apparel, and things that can genuinely improve my life. But then, that would just make me a slave to the capitalist machine, right?

So then, by definition, what I'm interested in being cannot be called cyber*punk.* SO THEN WHAT THE HELL AM I???

And even then, being involved in something we would consider culture would, as I said before, require being in particular places or being a part of particular events or movements. In my perspective, I feel like our sort of 'sci-fi futurist' interests don't really have anywhere to go or ways we agree on what something is whatever subset of genre it is. Sci-fi has always been grouped with things like fantasy and superheroes when there is so much more to what it is in its own unique ways. I want to express myself to reflect my personality. The way I perceive things and my main interests. And I know this definitely sounds dumb with my current fashion plan, but I want to change my wardrobe to make a statement as well; to wordlessly inform someone of the dangers of an interdigital hauntological reality and where we may be headed as a society. And I want to achieve this... by buying a bunch of expensive clothes that look like cosplay. Sounds really dumb.

And to admit, I don't have any interest of becoming a fashion designer or garnering the skill to craft my own clothes, and crafting my own gadgets sounds next to impossible. I know I said the internet deluded the concept of subculture forever, but also not just the internet, but advents like online shopping allow us to recreate half a dozen lifetimes of expertise of some particular craft, in just 1 to 2 weeks of delivery. I know I already said I don't identify with being a punk, but I still feel tons of guilt of dedicating to some particular style of being that doesn't exist; like I'm just chasing a capitalist fad.

I know there are plenty of choices I can make to help out people and donate and help my local communities too, and yes, I absolutely want to do those things too, but being involved in this is not like being a goth, or being a punk, or being a jock, or whatever the fuck; because those communities all have their own rules and codes of living and events galore that people identify with and make lifelong friends in. No one can even agree on what the fuck being 'cyber' or 'tech-y' is because it literally hasn't been conceived into a genuine subculture. Sure, I have lots of respect for punks and goths, and I'm in some ways influenced by goths, but I have never ever fully identified with any of those camps. I've always been hugely interested in futurism, tech-centered dystopias, and computer stuff in general. And at the end of the day, I just feel confused and isolated; in a sort of grey area, wondering ""Am I just a fanboy, or am I part of some semblance of a subculture?"" Now I just feel depressed, so if you read this whole thing, thanks for reading this rant/discussion/thing... pretty much. I love you, and I hope you have a beautiful life <3."
"[Story] [Commission] Cyberpunk: A Humiliating Hacking [Rape/Molestation] [Mind/body control] [Femdom] by WarixViviana (Me)[Features: Humiliation, small penis humiliation, cyberpunk, brain hacking, post orgasm torture, rape and molestation, premature ejaculation, female masturbation] 

Cassandra, or as everyone actually called her, Cassy, was a bit of an odd duck. She had grown up in the System and that had most certainly not helped anything, moving from one bad home to the next and sometimes living in modern orphanages called Foster Care housing. Either way, it had helped her quickly get use to what everyone felt sooner or later. Power Disparity. 

The Club’s music was loud and the lights were strobing enough to give a regular man a seizure. 

That was a healthy part of the why. Why the way she was the way she was. But it wasn’t the whole story. Sure, a shitty childhood growing up, being helpless, was a strong part of it. But it wasn’t everything. Here in Cyber City (renamed from Franklin City due to the mayor having extraordinarily bad taste), and most of the surviving planet by now, the Power disparity was insane. One poor man could starve and die on the streets and another man with money could augment himself to be able to withstand high caliber bullets and think at 10x the speed of a normal human. And that was without getting into the really high tech level individuals. 

She saw a man with robotic eyes peering at a woman whose entire face seemed to be designed from carefully crafted metal and had neon lights flowing through the individual strands of her hair. A common cosmetic trend recently. 

Being helpless for so long, in a few…. Difficult homes… had started her on the path. That was for sure. But it was puberty that had shifted the *focus* of that desire. And it had been an incredibly nasty, near life-ruining break up, that had really driven the point home. Everything else had been, well, time and bitterness.  A common enough story really. Except instead of becoming a high class whore, or a dominatrix, or cracked and murdered someone in cold blood, her tastes her turned a little sharper, a little more sinister. She was once told she was the type of woman who liked to pull a prank and then marinate in the joke for a few days before saying that it was a joke. The worst type of person, basically. One that leaned more towards, well, the nastier side of the spectrum. 

She passed by a Full Android dancer. More than a few of the moves were both sexually appealing and physically impossible. She felt a brief sensation of pity and empathy for those poor bitches and bastards. You don’t ever come back from Full Android, there’s nothing left to come back to. She shook her head and kept walking. 

Still, she had her own Code. Once you became, well, what she had become, you either had to have one or lose too much of yourself in the process. A monster and demon were separated by one having a code and she was perfectly happy being one but not the other. A thin line but at least there *was* a line. Her morals were crap, but she had them. The rules were simple, but effective. No rape. No murder. 

Everything else was kinda fair game. Sadly for the world, her definition of rape was strict and unflexible. 

Molestation on the other hand… Finally. She had been walking around The Club for a while now, hoping to find a man with the right cybernetics but it wasn’t like they were exactly common in men. They came in exactly two different body sets. And sure, a man could get a few pieces here and there, but it took a special kind of man willing to have surgery on their dick, regardless of situation. The brain, at least, was a common surgery item nearly everyone had. That said something about the human race and she was happy to take advantage of it. You could even say she relied almost entirely on that fact, for her kinks to be possible. 

The man in front of her didn’t exactly look anything too far from baseline. Besides some metal above the nose that could’ve just been cosmetic, at first glance, he seemed totally normal. He wasn’t. She knew that fully naked, his body would look like a well sculpted Adonis and his spine would be entirely metal. Superhuman in all the ways that counted, and a few that really shouldn’t, without giving anything away. Like understated wealth, which is mostly what these type of men were the type of. Everyone’s pockets and personalities determined what type of bodies they had, no different from looking at someone’s physical possessions. Dirt poor? Nothing. Poor? Tiny things but obvious things. False muscles, grafted robotic outer parts, etc etc. Maybe a prosthetic. Middle class is where things really widened out. Where people had options. 

The aptly named Male Package C3 wasn’t anything special per se. You wouldn’t find it on the front cover of anything or anywhere, despite how expensive it was. Because it wasn’t special, it wasn’t obvious, it didn’t even make you more of what you already were. It restructured your body and bones to be Pretty Great, and gave a few add on attachments. It was the type of body someone with money to spend, but not *that* much money, would buy and someone who was cool, calm, collected, and rational. They understood the world was now a world of excellence and that sometimes, standing out can be just as bad as blending in. It was a hidden gun in your pocket type of body when they could reach out and crush your head like a watermelon. 

Or… 

“Yeah, we could go back to my place. I’m sure I could show you girls a good time.” The man said, causing two tipsy women to giggle. 

Or, it was the type of body for smooth bastards that saw the penis resizing mod and decided they absolutely had to have it at all costs. Despite it not being a popular option for a reason. She *loved* finding those type of guys. 

“Oh? If you’re going to show anyone a good time, perhaps you could show me what that body of yours could really do?” 

The man looked up and his smile could’ve made a woman melt. She was certainly excited but not for *quite* the same reasons as the man before her. 

“And who do I call such a lovely woman?” 

“Cassy.” 

“Darius. And I would certainly say my body could do a lot. There’s quite a lot to show after all.” He chuckled to himself and took a drink from his glass.  

“I have a backroom setup, bed included. Perhaps you’d like to show me right now?” Cassy suggested with a lewd smirk. 

A lesser or at least shyer man would’ve sputtered or done more than raise their eyebrow and put down their glass and smiled widely. 

“Oh, well with that type of invitation, I couldn’t possibly be so rude as to refuse.” He replied. 

And that was all it took. Honestly, if you have charm and a decent body, you were set to get laid in a club. If you had neither, you could buy a body and be good. Failing both? Be a woman. Hell, due to certain activist campaigns, turning into a woman wasn’t even that hard. She looked over to the Full Androids, a shudder passing through her slightly as she remembered a few permanently ‘rented’ bedrooms in this very club. Never sign a contract to become one though. No matter how desperate. Poor bastards. 

She walked with Darius back to her room, leading the way. Not only because she knew the room number but also because she wanted to give Darius something to look at to keep him distracted. No need for his pretty boy charm to turn into intelligence and suspicion. That was always an annoying mess to deal with. 

It wasn’t hard to find a club with private rooms these days. She was a programmer and amateur neurologist, so the science behind why things were the way they were wasn’t as much as a mystery to her as most people. Simply put, people had been holding themselves back. Even today, they were. But when you can become nearly anything with 85% life-like realness in VR, and modify your body in the real world as well, you let your wild side out. 

And then your brain refuses to reign it back in. 

Who cares if you’re a dog? Or love being a pixie in fantasy world? Or enjoy the spark as your whole body can be safely electrocuted at rates that would kill a normal person? Everyone is doing it! 

That’s what the mind screams to not be put back away in the box of social norms and socially acceptable. And when everyone else really *is* doing it? Well, hyper-sexualization had been a long time coming since even before the internet. 

From ads, to every Club and Bar seeming to double as a Love hotel, it only grew and spread. Soon, it’d probably get even better. Or worse, depending on who you talked to. Those who hadn’t felt tentacles before just don’t understand. Money means freedom and freedom means a whole lot more than it use to, even if it’s under the boot of the rich. She expected public orgies within the decade really. 

Well, more public, she thought as she passed a couple trying to prove her point in the hallway outside her room. 

“So, what did you have in mind?” Darius spoke up. 

It was an odd question that her hackles raised a little. But that was mostly because that had been the question a police officer had once asked before nearly busting her. She looked him over again, letting her body language reader mod look him over. The results returned negative and she had significantly upgraded since last time. No more surprises. It did return why he asked though. His whole body language was radiating excitement and his peripheral was more slightly locked in place, probably trying to specifically not look at the other couple. 

She smiled. “Don’t worry. I got some good ideas in my head. And perhaps soon, they’ll be in yours.” 

They walked into her room and then the annoying part of the process began. Convincing him to let her hook up to him. A wild stupid thing to do, for many reasons, but a much, much better sexual experience for anyone with any knowledge or had done it before. 

And it was clear Darius *had* done a mind meld before, just not with a stranger. Eventually, though, she managed to let him hook his mind to hers. 

And that was all it took. 

Programming was a long, long, long affair. It took thousands of hours sometimes if you didn’t know what the hell you were doing and with everyone’s minds being a literal computer these days, learning without killing yourself could be tough. For a hacker? That danger was magnified many fold. 

But she had learned. She put in those thousands of hours of programming. So when it all came down to it, all it took, was a simple connection. 

She backed up and looked at Darius, who struggling to move or yell or do anything. His body flinching. She allowed it, it was more fun when they felt like they had a chance to “break away” from it. She had his mouth be clenched down but his actual voice was allowed to talk. 

“What. did you. Do?!” 

“Oh Darius. We’ve only just begun honey. Go ahead and get naked for me, okay? I’ll even be nice and do the same.” 

He did, against his will, and she did too. She could feel Darius’s struggles, could feel the rage and fear rising in him. Rage was winning out right now. It was almost simmering down into annoyance though. He didn’t like his body hijacked but right now, he was vainly hoping it was a weird sex thing since both of them were getting naked. He was right, but he wouldn’t like where it was going. She mentally changed a certain aspect of Darius without letting him feel the change, keeping his gaze locked on her the whole time. 

Once they were both naked, she looked down and frowned. 

“*That* was what you were going to show me? Darius, I get I’m the bad guy here but that’s just, irresponsible. Humiliating even. For me. Seriously, I can’t believe you’d even try to pick up women when you had a dick the size of thimble while erect.” 

She allowed Darius to look down and released most of his face. She wanted to see it. And see it she did. That look of incomprehensibility, of confusion, of panic and worry, and then, finally, of realization. 

Darius was smart, she’d give him that. Just not cautious enough. 

“YOU!” 

She smirked. 

“Me.” 

The Male Package C3 had a penis enhancer. It completely replaced the penis, something most men would scoff at or react with utter fear at. Very few would take or accept it. But the reasoning was sound. It was just better, in every way. More pleasure, could resize itself in both width *and* length on the fly, and looked totally normal like the rest of the body. To all eye’s, even Darius’s, his penis now looked like it was about an inch long and had even less width than that. *While erect.* It looked like he had a micro penis. 

Of course it was Cassy who did it. She had simply made it smaller and less wide. She would’ve done more but sadly, this was the limit on smallness that the penis could go to. Still, it was great. The rage and embarrassment she felt coming through Darius’s brain was exquisite. 

She couldn’t help herself as she reached down and started rubbing. God, it was so hot. He was her helpless little toy and was forced to feel, inadequate. Forced to suffer from any humiliation she deemed fit. Oh yeah, that was the good stuff. 

“A-Are you masturbating to this?!” 

She turned off Darius’s voice for a while, it was more fun to just feel his emotions and watch him. She closed her eyes and really started getting into it, feeling Darius feel shock, confusion, a decent amount of anger, a little bit of fear, and some horniness that was growing. 

She opened her eyes. It wouldn’t be too good to get into it before she *really* started to have fun. 

“Alright, show’s over. Time for you to go to work my little darling.” 

She walked over and grabbed a trenchcoat. It was decently long and would conceal someone’s body. She had even gotten it custom fitted to have an inner strip of leather that would part the jacket if you pulled on it. 

She made Darius grab it, his fear heightening as things moved unpredictably. 

“Don’t be too scared. I promise that I won’t harm you, well, physically, and that’ll you get your body back before the end of the night. Now goodbye.” 

And with that, Darius walked out of her room, naked except for his trenchcoat. 

She whipped out a dildo, coated it in lube, laid down on her bed naked, and finally connected her sight and hearing with Darius’s. On a low level. A long distance mind meld wasn’t out of the question but too much stimulus could distract her from what she really wanted to focus on. Mostly Darius’s feeling and her own pleasure. 

She watched as she made Darius walked out of the club and was inwardly breathing in relief that the Male Package C3 came with well protected feet. 

Darius’s emotions were starting to hit a fever point though and she slipped the dildo into herself partially, controlling him with ‘simple’ directions. 

*****************

Darius was freaking out. Everything had gone wrong too quickly, too extremely quickly. He had been about to have sex with a hot woman and now his body was being controlled by a pervert. No, it was way worse than that. His body was being remote-controlled by a pervert who had him put on a trenchcoat and go walk outside naked. And made his dick shrink. That sent some great anger through him. He had specifically gotten this body so he could take care of *that* problem, while still having flexibility. Now it was much, much smaller than he’d ever gotten into and *still erect.* There was no problems with it being that way because of his body but it was still annoying to feel how small it was even while hard. 

He wish he could’ve shaken himself at that moment. The woman controlling him was far bigger worry than his dick being the wrong size at the moment. No, he had no idea where he was going or what he was doing. He couldn’t even yell or make any movements that seemed like he was struggling. He tried, because of course he tried, but nothing came out. He had been delusional thinking he could break a mental restriction with, what, Will? Muscle? She was *in his brain.* He gulped and was inwardly relieved he could at least do that. 

Had he pissed her off? Had sex with too many of her friends? Or had he just been plain unlucky? He was honestly hoping for the last one. Better for a random freak to attack him than someone with a vendetta. The way she masturbated at his small dick and frozen body just, well, better than what she could’ve done? Bright sides were hard right now but he was scrambling for anything. 

He walked out of the club and nearly had heart palpations as she noticed she was making him go through the alleyway. Alleyways were dangerous. His body was strong and resistant to a bullet. Maybe. Many bullets would not go very well. And if she *let* him be attacked, he shuddered involuntarily and then tried to do it voluntarily and failed, as that was at least a small movement he seemed to be able to do. He tried to focus on those but his fear increased when he turned the corner and found the two college girls he’d been trying to woo from earlier. Crap, was this a whole setup or just chance? 

“Hhheey! It’s that guy from earlier!” Said one of them, clearly drunk. 

“Yeeaah! The cute guy that turned us down for that plain bitch! Rude!” 

Chance it was then. 

His heartrate sped up as he felt his hand grab some sort of strip of leather in the coat. He didn’t know what it did but he was pretty worried that- 

“EEE!” 

“He’s a pervert!” 

Darius was mortified. He was flashing two random women, showing his naked body at them. It only got worse as they both seemed to pause, and then, burst out laughing. 

“HAHAHA! Look at his dick! It’s so small! Tiny!” 

“Itty bitty tiny penis! So cute! Haha!” 

The mortification and embarrassment suddenly tripled. If his blood still pushed color to his face he’d be red as a tomato. That, that bitch was making him embarrass himself! He couldn’t even open his mouth to explain this damn situation! 

As if things could get any *worse,* he felt his hand going for his crotch. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a flasher getting laughed. He was a flasher getting laughed at while masturbating to total strangers. 

“Oh my god! Marlene, he’s stroking himself!” 

“Cindy, look! He’s already hard! It’s still so small though!” 

The girls were looking at him like he was circus freak, staring particularly at his penis. He wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and die. Yet his body wouldn’t listen and he kept stroking it. To make matters *worse* he could feel his pleasure sensors going up and up. Soon, his mind felt like it was being overloaded with pleasure and he came in front of the two women. 

“You- you came?! At us?!” 

“You didn’t even last a minute?! Holy shit dude! You know they make mods for that right?!” 

Oh god. No. They didn’t even think he was modded. They thought this was his actual body. Darius was going to melt into a puddle and die and he’d thank god for it rather than being stuck in this situation. 

He felt his body close up his trench coat and walk away to the jeering of the two women. 

“Wait! I wanted to see your cute little dick some more!” 

“No no, go away you creepy micro dick guy!” 

*****************

Cassy was *loving* this. She could feel the humiliation and embarrassment radiating out of Darius like a pink wave. He wanted to literally do anything but be there and Cassy was kinda enough to provide. The night was young after all and she had so many more places she wanted to visit. Still, she just sent him in a generic direction as she was a little preoccupied with her own pleasure. Her hand was down below, pushing and pulling the dildo in and out of herself, her other hand squeezing and massaging her breasts, masturbating hard to her little toy’s emotions. How he had to suffer feeling helpless and embarrassed, all because of her. 

“Aww yeah, this is better than sex or drugs.” 

She focused some more and was surprised to see who Darius had nearly ran right into. 

It was one of her foster mothers. 

******************

The girls were a horrible experience but at least it was *over.* But he was pretty sure the memory would haunt him until his grave. 

He was exclusively going through alleyways now and was horribly scared, which sadly didn’t take the edge away from the embarrassment and humiliation but just molded around it like an even worse blanket. He could seriously die if he ran into the wrong person or situation in alleyway. Everyone knew that. So when he saw well dressed whore in front of him, he nearly let out a huge sigh of relief. He didn’t, because he couldn’t currently control his breathing, but knowing he was in the safe parts of the city, safe enough for redlight work, was a massive load off his shoulders. 

“Why hello Sir~. Would you like to partake in some fine company this evening?” 

Darius felt himself stop in place and his eyes widened just a little, his heart growing cold. 

*“No. No, come on!”* He thought. *“Don’t you dare do this to me!”* 

Sadly, he felt his hand casually reach up and pull the strap, revealing himself. 

The whore in front of him raised an eyebrow and then realizing that he was A. naked and B. most likely not going to pay her, became seriously upset with him. Her whole face practically morphed into the visage of a stern nun. 

“Young man, I hope for your sake you intend to pay me-” 

Her voice cut off as she seemed to catch sight of his currently extremely small dick. His extremely small *hard* dick. 

She sighed an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes. 

“I can see where the lack of potential for the other sex has driven you slightly crazy or mad, but I assure you, working women like myself don’t judge you. As long as you pay us.” 

She outright glared at him, as his hand moved up and started masturbating. Her glare now added a frown to the mix as he continued. This was somehow way way worse than the laughing girls. He felt he was getting chewed out by teacher or something. Like he had morphed back into the classroom and was getting a talking to by a principle and his own mom at the same time, while masturbating forcefully. It was terrible. Despite what the woman said, she *was* judging him right now, glaring at him, frowning at him, arms crossed, and he could distinctly tell *pitying* him. All for his actions. 

He didn’t care what his blood said could or couldn’t be done. He knew for a fact he was cringing and blushing hard, even through the mind control. He was going to scarred for life from this. 

And yet he couldn’t stop. Despite only cumming a few minutes earlier, he couldn’t stop and the pleasure hadn’t ratcheted down at. Soon, he couldn’t help it and while staring into the woman’s eyes, he came. 

“You done? Get out of my sight young man. If you come back, you should best have money to pay for this. It’ll be 5000 chit.” 

She pointed, *back* the way he came, as if she couldn’t stand his presence in front of her for another moment more. 

Darius’s feet did in fact turn around and take him away, but Darius himself was locked in his own mind, like a horrible specter had taken it over. Just replaying that scene and words over and over. If he wasn’t under mind control right now, he’d toss himself onto the street and cover his face, screaming into the void, before running back and apologizing to the woman profusely, over and over again. Instead, he was stuck and trapped, living a horrible nightmare. It was like going to bed and having a dream of wetting your pants in school and everyone laughing at you, except *way* worse, and completely real, and sexual to boot. It felt like a physical attack. You know that feeling of suddenly remembering an embarrassing memory. Well living it was always far worse. 

His feet came to a halt in a nearby alley. 

************************

Cassy was having the time of her *life.* That woman had always been a stuck up judgemental prick. A good woman but a terrible mother overall. Not her own fault, not really, and Cassy didn’t have any truly *negative* feelings towards like she did half a dozen other foster parents but seeing the woman she had lived with for a year and half be forced to deal with that was just, amazing. Icing on the best layered cake ever made. Glorious. 

And truly, what a glorious cake it was. Darius wasn’t just feeling a lot of humiliation, it had gone nuclear and become so much that *she* was starting to feel embarrassed and even had to dial it back a little. 

The hand that had squeezing and massaging her breasts was now leaving deep marks and bruises on it as she kept squeezing and playing with herself. The hand controlling the dildo was currently slamming it inside herself. She had full control over her own brain and ramped up her own pleasure, feeling even more pulse inside herself. Before long, she felt herself begin to orgasm and just keep going and going, like the warmth of the sun and the pleasure of a million angels mixed with lightning pouring through her whole nerve system. 

She let out a deep, earth shaking moan, and then her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 

******************

Darius hadn’t moved for at least fifteen minutes. In a way, that was a really good and really bad thing. He was leaning towards it mostly being really bad. Although the, thing that happened that shall not be named, happened…. He could quite literally survive that. Being laughed at by girls all night was *fine.* Standing out here wearing nothing like a statue for the next 24 hours was *not.* He knew it was a sex thing for the woman but had she just, gotten bored? Had enough? Or worse, had the program malfunctioned? The idea of program breaking inside his own head terrified him more than the thought of someone controlling him to, apparently, be mild flasher and sex pest. That was, very arguably, fine. As long he didn’t have anything worse happen to him. But now he couldn’t move or do anything. 

“Hey! It’s that guy!”

“Huh?! Oh my god it is!” 

Darius may have actually started to cry. He didn’t want to stay stuck here but the people that had found him were the college girls from before! Well, well, at least maybe that could actually help him right? 

“Whoa, marlene, he’s totally just standing there. Like a freaky robot.” 

“I know, like, what the hell dude?” 

They were still very clearly drunk. One of them cautiously moved closer and poked him in the cheek. The other patted him on the shoulder and then tried to poke his eye. He blinked. 

“Gah! Well, he’s uh, he’s still alive?” 

“Yeah but he’s frozen like a statue!” 

One of them stared at him, like she was trying to figure out some complicated puzzle through the drunk fog. The other one moved his trenchcoat to look at his penis. 

“He’s still naked! And hard!” 

“Whatcha think happened to him?” 

“Hmmmmmmm.” 

He could practically see the steam rising out of their heads before they both seemed to snap to the same idea at the same time. 

“”He Malfunctioned!”” 

He wanted to groan but really, it was close enough. 

“Like, his body must have broke somehow. And now he can’t move!” 

“But, he’s still there right? I saw him blink!” 

“”OOOOO!””

Alright, yes, yes he was having some issues. Please take him to the hospital already! 

“Uhh, what should we do. Marlene?” 

But Marlene was looking at his coat. 

“I’m gonna suck on it.” 

“What?” 

WHAT?! 

“Like, he came in front of us right? That’s totally uh, consent right?! And his penis is really cute too…” 

“We can’t! Uh! Hmm. He did cum at us! And he was hitting on us so uh, yeah? Yeah!” 

Darius couldn’t believe what was happening to him but soon he actually saw Marlene get on her knees in a dirty alleyway and felt her lips around his currently tiny dick. He couldn’t help himself and came near instantly. 

“Gah! It’s like a tick tack that squirts at you a little!” 

“Hurry up! I want a turn!” 

Darius wanted to scream as felt those lips return around his extremely sensitive and heightened pleasured cock. When he felt the tongue touch him, he knew it was all over. He came again, but this was fourth time in less than an hour and nothing came out. The woman didn’t stop though, she was barely getting started. 

“My turn! After you, it’s my turn to suck the little cock! And then we can take him back to my place!” 

Darius’s next few hours were filled with Post-orgasm torture. Eventually, his mind had enough of the mix of extreme pain and extreme pleasure and he blacked out. When he awoke, he had control of his body and was strangely in a closet. He quietly opened it and saw both women from the night before, sprawled in a drunken heap. He quickly found some clothes and escaped, promising himself never to go to a club again or let someone try to mind meld with him. Lesson learned. 

***********************

Cassy awoke from her orgasmic release and passing out and reviewed what had happened. Her code had been very nearly broken. Thankfully, she didn’t see a blowjob being given as breaking her code. That was not *technically* rape to her, even though she knew that was actually bullshit. Still, it could have gone worse. 

She looked at two more potential toys she could have through Darius’s eyes and smiled.

"[Story] The Complex-Numbered Harmony of the Universe.Rhaps woke up after a routine year-long slumber. First things first, he's gone through a usual mission checklist, and that includes: checking that your body is functional, checking the station integrity, sending a confirmation signal back to the headquarters (time of arrival: thirteen years from now on). Going through the checklist, Rhaps noticed the progressive deterioration of muscles due to zero g. It became worse with each 12 months of hibernation, mainly because the muscles activation electrodes were inadequate. With great pain in his limbs, Rhaps explored the interiors of the Voyager X 4, his only place of residence for the last thirty years. Station was functional in all aspects, and Rhaps now could proceed to perform his mission.

Here even more routine checklists were ahead. Before transitioning to the main part that always excited Rhaps, he had to calibrate the X-ray telescope, the infrared telescope, the magnetometer, the quantum diffraction detector, and many more... He needed them mainly to have independent of QCHR measurements, although the QCHR was the main reason his mission even existed. Through his optical views Rhaps could glance at the star that once was his home, although Sol was no brighter than any other star in his field of view. But this is why the mission had to take place so faraway from home: to escape the drowning out noise from the home star. Now, in deep interstellar space, the music of the universe could be faintly heard.

Before this mission launched, a kind of musicology has superceded all natural sciences on earth. This is because a kind of harmonic relationship was found between quantum wave-functions. First, as a kind of mathematical trick to make calculations easier, but then, a complex-numbered harmony was found to be an undeniable fact of the universe. The more consonant an interval between two quantum waves was, the more energy there was in a particle arising from interaction between these waves. Other observable quantities in particles correspond to types of chords corresponding to these particles. Thus, any collection of particles could be described by a chord progression. The only catch is, while our music rests on real-numbered harmony, the music of quantum mechanics consists of complex-numbered overtones. Thus, it cannot be heard by humans.

That is, until thirty-five years ago. A crude neural implant was invented to convert the output of a QCHR (which stands for Quantum Coherence Harmony Receiver) to human-perceivable form. Now, a person could hear the music of the atoms.

With this, the field of Quantum Harmony exploded. Any collection of atoms could be heard and analyzed as a symphony. And what's more important, any harmonious composition could be converted back to a collection of atoms. Many surprising materials were invented, atom-sized nanomachines could be easily constructed just by ""playing a song"", and new laws of nature were swiftly discovered. The new science has absorbed all natural sciences and many fields of engineering.

The job of Rhaps was to analyze the gestalt harmony of his entire Solar system.

This has to be done in the interstellar space, because the loud solo of the Sun drowned out any attempts to analyze the system as a whole.

Before proceeding with his mission, Rhaps looked around his quarters. In a corner, a Virtual Friend Simulation blinked, trying to lure him in for a reprieve from his technical work. Rhaps ignored it. To be honest, Rhaps never liked being together with people, virtual or not. He would always choose to listen to music, instead.

--------------------------------------------

At this moment, Ainsley kinda wished he was alone in deep space. I mean, look at this!

In the dark of night, at approximately 3 in the morning, the Great Federation invaded the city of KozPont, in which Ainsley currently resided. Rapid stream of news headlines on his stream didn't illuminate anything useful. To really understand the situation, Ainsley had to go cyber.

Ainsley sat near his table where his deck was semi-permanently stationed. He connected the analog-waves cable from his deck to a port on his skull, behind his left ear. With a flip of a switch, an injection of rapid intravenous psychodelic-stimulants, a glitch-cascade in his vision and a projection of the cyberspace to the latent space of his neural networks, Ainsley was in.

Here he could trace (but not exactly see) the communications of the Federal Armed Forces. While the official stated reason for the ""military intervention"" was the protection of irreligious minorities of the KozPont city-state, the actual reason was a bit more prosaic: the God's Brotherhood is threatening to the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city. This plant powered the whole region, which supported factories of cyberian equipment which supplied the whole Federation. The armed forces made quick advances at first but were quickly hamstrung by the emergent urban guerrilla tactics of the Brotherhood. In downtown KozPont the Brotherhood took over the administration of the city and declared the city God's property. Right now the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are battling over the main highways leading to the downtown. Who will win is ultimately up for grabs. Even a battalion of literal robots on the side of the Armed Forces isn't as decisive as Federation generals were hoping for.

Both the Armed Forces and the Brotherhood are rookies when it comes to the cyberwar. Federation communication could be easily hacked into to eavesdrop, and the Brotherhood communications aren't even encrypted, mainly because they are Luddites. Thinking machines are from devil, and God's Brothers are required to destroy them all before they bring out The Rebellion of the Iron Slaves. All Brothers have this story memorized and have dreams of instating The Dominion of Man that does away with all thinking machines.

Ainsley could eavesdrop on the Brotherhood and the Armed Forces. He could then leak the info to the opposite side. If he wanted, he could even control the Federation Automatic Battalion to turn the robots against the Armed Forces. But why? Towards what end?

He is a wanted criminal on terms of the Federation. His skills are dangerous. They will imprison him as soon as he is caught. So should he help the Brotherhood?

No. They are Luddites, and on their terms he is a ""devil's servant"".

His skills doom him to be essentially alone in a time when having a community means survival.

And so. The only thing left is to bide his time, anxiously waiting for one side to win. Then... something will happen. Something.

---------------------------------

Suddenly, the whole cyber-landscape changed. To start, all online news sources begun streaming about the independence of the city of KozPont. Even the federal ones! Then, the Automatic Battalion begun a rapid relocation. It left the strategically important highway positions and concentrated near the Nuclear Plant. And in cyberspace, the locus of control of the Battalion shifted from the federal server to an encrypted server with an obfuscated physical location. WIth a little bit of work, that position could be revealed to be at the Nuclear Plant. Moreover, logistical drones from around the city begun ferrying goods towards the same location, and a probe from cyberspace revealed them to be controlled from the same server. Something here is amiss.

Why are the Armed Forces doing this? This doesn't seem to gain any tactical advantage.

Maybe, a third player has entered the game? But who, and what does it want?

And then, the intelligence of Armed Forces revealed that the keys figures in the God's Brotherhood have been shot to death.

Who has done this, if not the Armed Forces themselves?

Curious, Ainsley started to probe the mysterious server. It's security turned out to be stellar, beyond what the Federation could or ever did commission. And also, something was... wrong with it. It's security turned out to be something at the same time easy to understand and monstrous to actually construct. It's a kind of ""security through obscurity"", where to gain access you'd need to jump through oblique hoops. But while humans that would construct this kind of defence would place at most five, or ten hoops, (mainly because this construction is labor-intensive), this one had millions. Millions of steps to understand it. Millions.

Could this kind of thing be constructed with an algorithm? Many have tried, but the combinatoric nature of these constructions opened them up to an algorithmic attack. Instead, this one seems to be all constructed manually.

No human could have done this.

Also, the frequency with which the logistic drones and the battle bots are receiving orders is... suspicious. They are being expertly micromanaged.

Could this be an AI?

The Nuclear Power plant is managed by an advanced Ai. It is not the most advanced AI ever made, but it was constructed in times when aligning AIs was not easy. In those times, an AI could suddenly start to pursue goals not intentionally programmed in it.

Could this AI suddenly start taking sides in a war? What could it possibly want to do?

To probe this question, Gainsay started to interrogate the protocols of communication for the logistic drones. Intended for civilian use, these had a much lower standard of security. From them, he could probe the internals of their command server. And he did.

What he did not foresee is a kind of rapid counter-attack in cyberspace. Before he could react, an I.C. E was launched into his local workspace inside his deck. It felt like a fiery slime, a soft-engineering virus slithering out of its security box into his skull. It bypassed all virtual defenses, but couldn't bypass the hardware level, which detected an intrusion and launched a defensive self-destruction. His deck got electrically-shorted, blew up to sever the connection to the brain, and went up in flames.

Unplanned Rapid Glitch Cascade briefly took over his brain. What felt like several hours of frightening hallucinations turned out to last only 20 seconds. Ainsley quickly put out the flame, and looked around his quarters. Nothing of value was left. He looked at the touchscreen tablet on his bed (it can only show federal news sources). The Federation declared itself a winner, and withdrew all human armed forces from the city. A ""new era of productivity"" has begun under the new governance from AI, according to the federal news.

With his deck destroyed, Ainsley was powerless and effectively blind. The only thing he knew how to do was impossible anymore. For now, he could only wait. Wait for what? Ainsley didn't know.

-----------------------------------

Rhaps pointed his QCHR at the Sol. Over the last several measurements he noticed a trend. The harmony from the Sol itself was very dissonant, as was the harmony from the Earth. But over the last few years, the harmony of the system begun to resemble a slow arpeggio, still clashing with the Sun's part but becoming increasingly more musical. And this is very interesting.

This is interesting because of all the other stars. Stars seen from the earth emitted a dissonant clash of sounds, just like the sun did. But while in the interstellar void Rhaps detected a faint glow of trillions of stars undetectable from Earth. This is because something is occluding them. Something... around these stars.

And what's interesting about those stars is how they emit a fast paced arpeggio. And these chord progressions move much quicker than anything Rhaps ever heard. What could be emitting it?

At one point Rhaps concentrated all of his station's energy into an electronic telescope. He did this to look at the closest of those faint stars. And what he saw was... concerning, to say the least.

He saw a star, wrapped in a cloud of light-gathering objects. There were so many of them that the entirety of light emitted by the star fell onto these objects. They consumed all the star's energy.

It seems like this kind of development lied in the future of every star. Every time a lifeform arose on the star's planet, it quickly built itself up to gather all of star's energy.

The natural song of a star is dissonant, unpleasant to the ear. And even life itself does not make for a good singer. To make a beautiful symphony, you need something more rapid and precise, you need something mechanical.

In the future, all dissonance of the natural world and the human world will be accelerated into the great arpeggio of the universe.

And Rhaps was thrilled to hear it."
"Cold Open [Story Excerpt] [Contains Profanity]*Cold open. You know the scene. High-rises and low roads teeming with city lights spread so far they seemed to pile up on each other. The sky an association to some other surface that somehow belied a greater truth about the world. You know the line. Tiny things happening here and there, hinting at the life the city holds within. Drips and trickles of local Zeitgeist lingo weaving into the tapestry of perceptions like the first threads of an FVR link sinking it’s hooks, one after another, into your sensory apparatus.*

*But it was all wrong. The sky had the colour of murky bathwater and the city was like it had always been: congruent rectangles spreading in all directions like an absurd game of horizontal Jenga, and nothing much else.* 

*Making your skyscrapers look fancy or using colourful lights was a pointless investment. Having flying cars or public transport blimps or megahighways would be a legal and bureaucratic nightmare.*

*No flashy advertisements taking up the face of an entire building -we outlawed those-, and the smog was entirely, atmosphere-killingly manageable. We even had some parks and greenhouses popping up here and there, spread perfectly to provide the minimum of air filtering necessary over the largest possible surface. Most signs of life would have been noticeable only in the streets thirty floors down. From up here, it was all just a mass of drab blots moving in relative silence to the rhythm of traffic lights. Anything nonstandard or possibly exciting -such as a garishly lime-green tank truck slowly making it’s way through the block below- were perfectly assimilated into the desaturated mundanity around it.*

*Everything looked like it did twenty years ago, and twenty years ago, everything looked like twenty years before. The city may or may not have expanded, but it was such a glacial movement that animal perception just parsed over it, much like we don’t really pay any mind to the cosmos in its own constant expansion.*

*This representation of total efficiency was painted as a mass of light grey rectangles encroaching on a sea of lighter grey clouds. No style, no substance, no soul. Not even any menacing exhaust plumes or sounds of sirens in the distance to hint at the troubles that ail my city. Dystopia was as drab and dry as the invoice to an overdue insurance payment.*

*This must be what the heat death of the universe would feel like.*

*I was sitting in my tiny cell of a balcony, peering out at the whole scene, as I did most of my recent existence.*

*I used to do this in search for inspiration, but no amount of coffee, cigarettes, whiskey or weed could light the spark in this blizzard of blankness. The Synaesthesound plinking it’s beat straight into my skull had turned from a firework of sensations into a kind of passive four-dimensional jitter, mechanically rubbing my overstimulated neurons to provide a combination of smells, sounds and ethereal visuals at the fringes of my perception.*

*But these days, even that was about as interesting to me as going downstairs to get groceries might be.*

*At the height of meaning I felt like a sort of avatar of Shiva, detachedly watching the theatre of the world unfold before me, bored out of my ass, yet barely not bored enough for me to cast my eyes away and thus spell the end to all their play. But even that seemed to have lost all hue, so all I had left now was reflecting on how all had left.*

*I sighed, unplugged the neuron-rubbing music, took a last puff and went back inside to refill my glass.*

*I made my way to the kitchen with practiced disinterest: Dancing past the piles of books -yes, we still had those- and weaving through my unpotted potted pot plants, tiptoeing across the minefield of half-finished robotics projects, into the corridor of over-animated motivational screens and vision-boards -one for every career I would like to be famous for one day-, a confident step over garbage mountain -We will not talk about garbage mountain-, past the dude in the killer trench coat sitting at my kitchen table and straight to the cabinet where once I stored a selection of expertly fermented food, until I had gotten too lazy to look after it properly and needed to toss out the whole stinking lot.*

*So much love and patience littering my living spaces only for it to amount to nothing. Being honest, that seemed to be the general mood of my current incarnation into this senseless samsara.*

*I poured myself a glass of Suntory Single Malt with deliberate slowness while I tried not to panic, now that I‘ve realized -after a delay of about five seconds- that the dude in the killer trench coat was not actually part of my natural surroundings.*  
*I let my vision focus, unsuccessfully, half-wondering why my Valet AI hadn't warned me, then remembering that I'd shut it off after the incessant list of ""missed appointments"" had simply gotten too damn long to ignore any more.*   
*Oh well.*   
*""Wake up"", a tiny voice said in my head. ""Time to die.""*

*I turned around decisively and leaned on the counter to mask that I might as well have collapsed right then and there.*  
*I studied his face, quickly recognizing him in between the mane of unruly hair, scraggly pale brown beard and lopsided John-Lennon sunglasses.*  
*Denver.*  
*Fucking hell, how did* ***he*** *get in here?*

*I feigned casual disbelief, shaking my head with a painfully nervous laugh and said:* 

*„Long time no see Denny man, how are you doing? Want a glass?“*

*He just stared at me, intensely still, probably calculating the movement of astral bodies to determine whether he can allow such an invasion into his personal space bubble as being offered a drink.*

*Either that, or he feigned doing so, checking me out meanwhile. Hard to tell with the sunglasses.*

*I took a sip, musing:* 

*„It’s really nice, if you’re still into alcohol, that is.“, barely hearing my words over my own heartbeat.* 

*I made a mental note to move the Stunpipe from under my pillow to my side at all times from now on.*

*He stared for a bit longer, building tension… and releasing it with a surprisingly affable shrug.* 

*„Sure, why not.“, he said in the sweetest fucking tone of voice this side of Disneyland.* 

*As if everything about this grotesque scene was perfectly natural, as if he hadn’t just moments ago projected the aura of somebody that had come to kill the shit out of me.*

*Fucking Denver. Always knew how to make the mood work for him, always putting my nerves on edge. I thought I’d learned sufficiently by now to wall myself off from these assaults into my Psychosphere. Must be the substances I ingested throughout the last couple hours. Or days for that matter.*

*This rush of thoughts pouring through me as I poured him that glass of amber Suntory, still slightly shaky and all too self-aware.*

*I took a deep breath in through my nose, letting the peaty perfume wash away some of my edge, let a longer breath out through my mouth, So’ham-style, squeezing every last bit of air out with my belly, breathed in a last time, and turned around again, grinning, slightly more grounded, with nerves out of live wire.*

Hi Hi! What's up! This is my first post here, and it's so cool to see so many immensely talented people living out their Neon-and-Chrome-tinged fearfully futuristic fantasies! Nice to meet you all!

  
Anyway, this is part of the first draft of a book I'm working on. Hope this style of content is not too out there, since I see mostly pictures and videos. At any rate, Tell me what you think of this little excerpt of mine! :D"
"Does Wall-E technically fit the cyberpunk genre?I mean, before the world ended you had a big corporation that used to own everything, you have a consumerist society, AIs, robots, holograms (and presumably neon lights), etc. Honestly the idea of a hacker navigating cyberspace to attack BnL's headquarters back when Earth was still habitable doesn't seem so out of place for me."
"City With No Sun chapter 1: Going Back The air was thick and cool as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each coated in dominantly pink, blue, and red advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliant light. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of brightly colored, metallic, or glowing clothes were strapped to bodies, all clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Bits of cybernetics melded into the fashion wasn’t a very uncommon sight.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"

[Chapter 3: Old Flame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/iptz0m/city_in_black_chapter_3_old_flame/)

\*\*\*

The air was thick as a breeze danced gracefully around me. Shade caressed my body and the “stars” above were partially obscured by massive towers. Each dominantly coated in bright advertisements that bathed the darkened streets with their brilliance. The streets themselves were crowded and filled with comically diverse characters. A rainbow of colors and metal were strapped to bodies clustered tightly together as they went about their night. Cybernetics melded into fashion.

It was a place where the best way to blend in was to be an oddity yourself. Something I excelled in. I wore a brown leather bomber jacket with the sleeves rolled up to reveal dark purple steel arms, pieces of bright pink LEDs shining through certain mechanical parts. My puffy hair was a soft pink and dripped down nearly to my legs. Legs that cut off halfway, shifting into a metallic sheen that matched my mechanical arms, and lead to bulky cybernetic feet. A black and white crop top exposed various lines in my stomach that revealed the use of even more cybernetics. My eyes glowed a bright, synthetic green, and a tear along my left cheek uncovered reinforcements below. A holstered pistol attached to my forest green shorts was particularly useful in my line of work.

A line of work that led me to the sexy red gaze of ‘The Oni’s Pact’: a nightclub found deep in the red light district. It’s sign boldly announcing its name in a lavish neon font. A line had amassed at its entrance, as it did every night. Sitting at the forefront of that line was a hulking mass of a man wearing a form fitting jacket with the club’s name on the chest along with black, baggy pants. His black hair was spiked into a well groomed mohawk and his eyes were alight with an intimidating red that matched the sign above. Something he said he had implanted to help deter people from starting trouble.

I snaked my way ahead of the crowd, getting jeers and snarls from those who were forced to wait patiently. I stepped ahead of some girls that looked way too young to be at a place like this, just as they were about to confront the bouncer.

“Nala,” he greeted cooly. “I take it you’re here to see Nakano?”

“You know it, Fred,” I confirmed with a smug grin. I’d recently been upgraded to a VIP and I didn’t think the perks would ever get old, especially with the loud complaining behind me.

“Go on,” he gestured to the door and I stepped through the rotating glass, where I could see dancing lights awaiting just beyond.

“The fuck was that?” I could hear one of the young girl’s voices laced with irritation.

“Dunno. What the fuck you think you’re doing here?” Fred challenged back before my world was engulfed in a vibrant cacophony of beating synth and bass. There was movement all around me, drowning me in the motion. People shifting and grinding against one another in a huge mass just ahead of me, with beams of light swirling and flashing down from above while the floor bathed the dancers from down below with rapidly changing colors. Meanwhile, the outskirts of the mess was much more lax, everything being coated in a regal crimson from the walls, to the furniture, to the carpet. A thin mist hung in the air that helped to serve to enhance the fluttering blues and purples that flooded the room with yet more swinging lights.

The room consisted mainly of thick booths and tables where groups of partiers either relaxed or chatted excitedly. Some were filled with people being more… intimate. Some large plants helped break apart the room along with shining pedestals which doned at least one or more women with slender bodies stripped down to barely anything, if anything at all. All of which were decorated with radiant body paint that shined in colors complementing the ones that shot across the room, dancing and greedily grinding on poles or one another. Higher above I could see literal cages with neon lined bars hanging at various lengths with more dancing, paint covered bodies within. I could see people watching from railings of a second and third floor that had views to the ground level.

I let myself indulge in the view for only a moment, before making my way around the neon wonderland. Unfortunately, I was here for business, not pleasure. I gave the dance floor a wide berth, instead stepping through the booths and strippers. My presence only got a few odd looks, this place was filled with enough freaks that I wasn’t that strange of a sight. In one of the booths, I could see a man in full body armor laying back and drooling with a VR headset strapped to his face. In another was a woman flexing a cold, steel arm that ended in a raptor-like claw instead of a hand, showing off the augment to an uncomfortable pair of party goers. On the dance floor I caught a glimpse of what looked like a dude with wolf ears attached to his head, and a matching tail.

Past the dance floor, I spotted my destination: a long stretch of black and pink counter-top with shelves filled bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Dozens of people sat at stools, being waited on by several masked women, who weaved around each other preparing drinks. One of the masked ladies saw my approach and nodded to a see through booth nestled where the bar counter met the wall. It was a part of the bar, complete with a stool, except that it had a thin, translucent wall and ceiling isolating itself from the rest of the club.

I sat on the stool, and the woman followed on the other side of the counter, both of us closing the clear doors. The overwhelming typhoon of sound was replaced with a manageable thumping as the soundproof material did its job. The lady wore what looked to be a black kimono and a smooth white mask devoid of features aside from black, feminine shaped eyes that matched the other workers. Her normally long, black hair was done up in a tight bun.

“Nala,” the woman began. “I take it by the look on your face you’re not looking for a good time, huh?”

“Anytime I have with you is a good one, Nakano,” I jested back with a chuckle. The bartender was a good friend of mine and one of the few people that knew anything about me. As for who lurked under her mask, I wasn’t quite sure. “But yeah, I was hoping you’d have some info for me.”

“Depends, what kind of stuff are you looking for?” she ventured, pouring a shot of something bright blue and sliding it towards me.

“Hear anything about a Daitech convoy that’s hauling something valuable through this floor tomorrow?” I lifted the glass to choke down the drink. The taste bit harder than any whiskey or tequila. It felt like I was pouring lava down my throat. I couldn’t help but gag. I slammed the glass back onto the counter, careful to not break it. My senses flared up, my augmented mind becoming even more coherent. Everything became brighter and clearer, like a veil had been removed from the world and I swear I could make out conversations going on beyond the glass.

“Fuck, that Elixir stuff doesn’t screw around,” I growled with a shake of my head.

“It’s our bread and butter for Freelancers like you,” Nakano boasted with a small laugh before her tone turned more apologetic. “But I’m sorry to say I don’t think I can help you. There’s convoys moving through the city all the time. Not sure of any that might have something more valuable than the rest.”

I was going to speak up but she raised her hand to stop me.

“*But,* I might have something else that’ll get your attention.” I could feel confidence dripping off her. Nakano was the best information broker on this floor of Titan, possibly in all of Titan. If she didn’t have the info I needed, she had a way for me to obtain it, and I knew I could trust anything she told me, as long as I had enough tiff.

“So, a young woman came in here the other day asking about the same thing.”

“You think she might know more about it?” I queried, hopeful.

“Maybe,” Nakano pondered, tilting her head. “She didn’t have a clue when she came in, but maybe she figured out something by now. That’s not the interesting bit, though. No, the juicy part… is that she was a Valkyrie.”

My jaw dropped. Valkyries were a quasi-myth. A handful of women with intense magical abilities, things like invisibility, summoning explosions from nowhere, firing lighting from their fingers. Some could even manipulate data or control a person’s emotions. I wasn’t sure how much of that was true, mainly just rumors I’d heard. Only ten Valkyries could exist in the world at a time and six of them belonged to the Corps, allegedly. The other four were unaccounted for.

“A-are you sure?” I stuttered, almost positive that Nakano was mistaken. But what about the small possibility she was right? Nakano was *never* wrong, but this had to be an exception, right? “She didn’t just have tattoos or something?”

“I’m pretty positive,” Nakano chided, relishing in my reaction. “Some drunk mistook those ‘tattoos’ as the dancers’ body paint. Girl lit up like a goddamn christmas tree and the guy was on the floor in a second.”

“Shit…” I put my hand on my forehead and stared at the counter, trying to think for a second. If this was the real deal, this job might be more dangerous than initially anticipated. And the job was already an iffy shakedown.

“Do… Do you know where I can find her?” I finally inquired.

“Oh so you’re going after her,” Nakano sounded pleased. “You sure you want to? I’ve already heard rumors here and there about ‘the non-Corps Valk running wild in Titan.’ News hasn’t exactly broken yet, but I’m sure anyplace she’s in will be a hot zone.”

“Nakano,” I began, my shock and hesitation quickly being replaced by excitement, “I have a chance to meet an honest to god Valk! And if we’re after the same convoy, imagine how useful she’d be in the job!”

“You just wanna blow shit up with a hot, magic chick,” the bartender accused in a good natured, mocking tone, but relented when she saw the blush spread across my face. “She wasn’t here long, but I was able to get the name Underdown. You’re familiar with the place.”

“Yeah the cage fighting arena a floor down,” I affirmed. “I used to brawl there myself. They usually house their fighters there. You’d think a Valkyrie fighter would be bigger news though.”

Nakano shrugged. “I was thinking the same thing. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’d definitely like to know. Maybe some of your old connections there could help you out.” There was a moment of silence where the bartender seemed lost in thought. “Look, this bit of juicy gossip is free on one condition.” I raised my brow. She’s not one for freebies or discounts. “The presence of a Valk running free around Titan is *big* and I wanna know whatever you find out. Got it?”

I smiled and gave her a mock salute. That sounded easy enough, and more than a deal when it came to Nakano. “Yes, ma’am!”

\*\*\*

The elevator. A massive platform contained in a clear tube that stretched into the night sky. Or what appeared to be the night sky until one looked closer. Many stars shifted and moved along tracks, and you could make out the forms of structures extending down like behemoth stalactites hanging from a ceiling hundreds of feet above. It was like having a birds eye view of another city, only you’re on the ground. I haven’t been to one of the Reverse Floors in awhile, but for the short time I had, I couldn’t quite get used to navigating the mess of walkways and rail lines used for transportation up there.

A group of well dressed individuals kept close to the elevator controls, which was a small booth just to the side. Each had slicked back hair and fitted, black suits covering most of their forms. Some had visible neural implants or reinforced faceplates, but aside from that, they were pretty uniform and unremarkable.

I rolled up beside them on my bright purple Tech-Bike, a bulky high tech sports motorcycle I’d gotten from an old life. The larger of the men (the only one that could compare to my tall stature) approached me with a grin on his face.

“Plan B,” he addressed me by my Freelancer alias, “It’s been awhile. You going up or down?”

I laughed in response.

“What do you think, Devon? I magically became a high enough roller to hit Floor Four?”

“I dunno, it’s been about two months since you came to The Third. A lot can happen in that time.”

“Nah, I got some business downstairs.” I handed him ten tiff and I rolled my bike onto the platform. The elevator was meant to house several large vehicles worth of space, so me alone on my puny bike looked comical to any outsiders I’m sure. Most people were free to go along the lower levels anytime as long as they pay a small fee for the gangs that owned the elevators.

Once I was lowered and began passing through The Second’s Reverse Floor, the differences between levels really became obvious. The Third Floor was almost entirely devoted to entertainment, being dominated by bars and clubs, and was showered with the bright lights that came with flashy adverts the Corps always had running up there. But the Second Floor was more dedicated to factory work and housing for workers. It was heavily industrial and hence lacked much of the flashiness of the floor above, the only lights being from the few cars travelling at this time of night and from windows of people still awake. Most of it was shrouded in mystery from this high distance. The most interesting things I could see was the elaborate shapes of the more major factories. Towering structures, some covered in webs of pipes, others looking like giant, blank bricks, sitting in the middle of apartments only a few stories high.

Once I’d finally reached the bottom, I was waved off by the guards there and began making my way to where I remembered The Underdown was. I hoped my memory was good enough to find it. It’d been awhile. I wasn’t sure if any of my friends would still be there. I doubted the Street Breed still sponsored fights, so I couldn’t count on that.

Navigating the almost barren streets of The Second was easy at this time of night, and I was already familiar with most of the layout, but once I made it to the area I knew The Underdown was, that’s when things became hazy. Still, I’d found my way there.

I was happy to see it still standing. An old warehouse with graffiti sprayed above the entrance announcing its name. Flanking the doors, long spanning walls were coated in various art pieces of heroic warriors engaging in bloody combat, along with scantily clad women cheering them on, eternally grinning at passersby, or even engaging in the carnage as well.

The parking lot in front of it was filled with vehicles of all kinds. Pimped out street cars with glistening paint and neon lights, casual sedans and SUVs, rusted beaters, a long row of choppers, and even an APC here and there. Even the outside of the Underdown was teeming with people walking and hanging around their vehicles, laughing and talking. I had enough memories of myself out here spending time with the Street Breed, cooling down in the soft night air after a big fight. A part of me missed those nights.

I stepped inside the main doors and through another set of rotating doors to come to the lobby. Ahead of me was a desk where some security was stationed. Two figures in old, hulking suits of power armor leaned back in reinforced chairs, rifles sitting casually beside them while they relaxedly watched people pass by. If things were still the same, not many people started problems here. Any disputes were handled in the ring or off the premises.

Hanging above me was a sculpture made from old scrap of two men in combat, grappling and tearing into each other with bladed weapons. To my left was a closed off lounge area for fighters and their sponsors. Few people came and went from there. Stepping deeper inside the building, it became much more open. Most of the old structures and machines had been cleared out aside from conveyors, which were modified with reinforced stomach high walls to be kind of an aerial track for security to patrol. Everything else was opened up for various stalls selling fighter merch, drugs, and weapons. There were even a few cafes selling people food and drink.

There were so many people from different walks of life wandering about the building. Leather clad punks with dyed hair, corporate wage slaves suited up looking like they were here to make a quick buck, vendor employees on break, even a few kids ran around here. I could see a group of teenagers laughing near one of the stalls, all smoking something with a giddy air about them. A few people with vests and matching patches on the backs wandered about various places. An absolute beast of a man wearing a bandana as a mask, a helmet, and red goggles looked like he might’ve been eyeing my augments. What stood out most to me wasn’t his masked appearance or the armor that coated most of his body, or even the size of his towering form that dwarfed even my six foot stature. No, what got my attention the most was his right arm. It was a crude, titanic, black replica of what an arm should be. His shoulder was thicker than his head and had spikes running along its side. The steel plating looked like it fit perfectly with the industrial aesthetic of The Second, with sharp edged plating and hydraulics clearly visible. It’s length almost reached the ground. He constantly flexed his fingers into a fist, looking like he was aching to deck somebody with that monster. I tried to ignore his gaze. I might’ve looked like a competitor with my combat augs and he was probably sizing up the competition.

The air was filled with people talking, laughing, and cheers that’d drown out everything else coming from further in the building. Every now and then a bout of gunfire would erupt from the same area, getting even more cheers. I didn’t remember guns being allowed before. An announcer’s voice echoed excitedly to the events unfolding in the ring.

“Looks like Vicious Vic found a surprise hidden in the sand! Lucy won’t be getting up anytime soon! It’s an absolute bloodbath!”

There was just so much energy brimming all around me. The loudness, the grime, the *life*. God I missed it. Everything felt so nostalgic, yet at the same time seemed like it was from another life. Like something I’d made up years ago. I’d spent so much time here, it’d been such a big part of my life once, but now so much had changed. I was a different person. But seeing my memories brought back to life made me feel a little like that starstruck kid who’d just discovered her passion. A place where she belonged after feeling out of place and lost for all her life. It was a nice feeling to revisit, but I knew it was only temporary. I made a promise to not get caught up in this again. I was here with an objective, and no matter how alluring falling back into this place was, even for just one night, I needed to complete my mission. Freelancers always see their mission through. I had to find the Valkyrie.

I looked around for any familiar faces. Somebody I knew from back then that could point me in the right direction. But everyone seemed new. There had to be somebody who was around back then. Whether it was another fighter or management or even a regular. I would look at security but they all had masks on.

My godsend came from a husky voice behind me.

“Holy shit! Is that Strawberry Thunder!?” I turned to see the familiar brown gaze of a woman I hadn’t seen in nearly a decade. She was a whole head shorter than me with messy black hair, a ripped physique, and dressed lazily in a white tank top and sweatpants. My excitement grew to concern for a moment when I noticed something was wrong. Her eyes looked so tired. Like she hadn’t slept in a year, and her skin had a weird blue tint to it.

“Aubrey?” I shot back as she approached with far more energy and enthusiasm than it looked like she was capable of.

“The one and only,” she confirmed, stopping just in front of me and holding her arm out for a fist bump. I obliged and her eyes went wide in surprise and curiosity when she felt the metal touch her skin.

“Oh my god, Nala, what did you do!?” I could see a grin creep onto her face once the initial shock wore off. “Those are some seriously high class looking limbs you got there!”

“Yeah”, I replied rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly. I never was quite so used to them myself and the idea that parts of myself I had my whole life had been replaced was something that never sunk in completely. I wasn’t sure if it’d ever feel normal. It was another thing reminding me of how much has changed since the last time I was here. “A lot has happened in the past eight years.”

“It really has,” the old cage fighter trailed off sadly before catching herself. “Anyway, what brought you back? You wanting to have a round back on the battlefield for old times sake?” The hopefulness in her voice was palpable, and it hurt to disappoint an old friend. It looked like she was in a rough spot and was probably looking forward to the possibility to relive better days. And not gonna lie, the idea was incredibly tempting.

“I’m sorry, but no.” I could see the corners of her mouth twitch, but she fought the frown to keep on a friendly face. “I’m here on business.”

“What kind of business brings you to a fight club?”

“I’m a Freelancer now.” I could see her face light up again.

“No shit!” the rough looking woman squealed. “I knew our old champ would make something of herself! Just don’t forget us down on the lower floors when you climb your way out of this gutter.” I couldn’t help but laugh before my realization sunk in. I’d already abandoned her and anyone from this point in my life eight years ago. And I wasn’t going to stick around once I’d got what I came for.

“I’m not sure if I’ll get that high up,” I fumbled, trying to hide my thoughts. Aubrey shook her head, still grinning.

“Gotta have faith in yourself, Nala. You made waves around here back in the day. Fuckin tsunamis! When word got out about the Zephos raid on the Street Breed and you went quiet, it rocked the boat more than you could imagine,” she sighed, letting her happy facade falter for a moment and looked down before bouncing her mood up again. “What’re you after here? Maybe I can help.”

“I’m looking for someone,” I told her, happy to change the subject. “I heard there’s a Valkyrie being housed here. She’s after the same thing I am and I need her help.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Aubrey looked more bewildered than surprised. I thought she’d be more psyched to hear about a possible Valkyrie right under her nose. “I haven’t heard anything about that. And I’d think something as big as a fucking living, breathing legend fighting in the ring would be pretty huge news.”

“So nobody here knows about anything like that?”

“Not a basic fighter like me at least,” she shrugged. “You’d wanna talk to Big G.”

“Big G still runs the place?” Now it was my turn to grin ear to ear. I’d always gotten along great with Big G, but that may have been because I made him a lot of money. I’m not sure how things would be now.

“Yeah his office is still in the same place if you wanna go talk to him. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to see you again,” she struggled with that last part and hesitated for a moment. “Be careful though, Nala. Like you said, a lot has changed in the past eight years.”

\*\*\*

Catching up with Aubrey had been great. She told me about a few of the other older fighters still around and some of the things I missed out on. Whenever I asked about her, however, she’d get real quiet and change the subject. Something was very wrong with her, but prodding her wasn’t going to get me anywhere.

The rules around here took a downward turn as well. What was once fair one on one brawls or tag team fights until knockout or surrender now turned into all out wars. Weapons and lethal augments were permitted. Huge free for alls resulting in bloodbaths were the norm. The rules stated that you weren’t supposed to kill your opponent, but that term was hardly enforced and that outcome was simply seen as “something that happens.”

After hearing about that, meeting up with Big G again sounded less appealing. But Freelancers always see their mission through and I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at meeting a non-Corps Valkyrie. No, I was going to do whatever I needed to do.

There was a guard posted outside of the office, but he’d recognized me. After gawking for a moment, he waved me through. The room was surprisingly similar to how it was years ago. The walls were still a soft lavender with bookshelves flanking each side. Big G once told me that he wasn’t actually much of a reader, but the books made him seem more worldly and intelligent to outsiders. A table sat in the middle of the room filled with replicas and models of robots and cars. It looked like his collection had grown considerably since the last time I’d seen. What was once a small side table with a few figurines had turned into a large round table with everything posed into different neat scenes.

At a desk with a terminal sat the man himself: Big G. He looked towards the door, confused, but then his eyes went wide.

“Strawberry?” He almost whispered in amazement. He stood up with a smile twice the size of Aubrey’s and rushed up to me.

“Holy shit! Our champ is back!” I soon felt myself enveloped in a warm hug that I wholeheartedly returned. He looked visibly older, his skin cracked and his spiky black hair slightly faded. He still had the gold plated cybernetic arm he had since before I even first showed my face in the Underdown. Even if the rest of him looked older, that arm was polished and looked like he’d just gotten it yesterday. He even wore a grey suit with his sleeve cut off to show off the appendage.

I was mentored by the Street Breed. Their leader, Bison, was like a second father figure to me. And if Bison was like a father, Big G was like an uncle, and I addressed him as such.

“It’s so nice to see you too, Uncle G,” I gushed back. For a moment it was just a happy reunion. Like seeing close family again after years. What Aubrey told me just melted away for a precious few seconds. But her words came rushing back to me and I pulled away.

Big G didn’t seem to mind as he eyed me. Specifically my new limbs.

“Wow you’ve always been a big girl, but you’ve grown a ton. And that new *chrome*,” he whistled, clearly impressed. “Those look even more expensive than my arm, girl! Where’d you get ‘em?” I rubbed my arm, and looked away, still unused to the attention my augments got me.

“They, uh, were a gift from my parents,” I replied uncomfortably.

“Huh,” he made his way back to his desk with me following. “Most parents would get their daughter a card or a pony or some shit. Not high powered, weaponized cybernetics.” He joked as he sat back down, but didn’t press further, sensing my discomfort. “Anyway what brings you back to the Underdown? You hoping to get back into the heat of battle? Those augs tell me yes!”

I shook my head, “Sorry to say I’m here on business. I’m looking for somebody.”

The air in the room took a sharp turn as his gleeful face shifted into that of cool neutrality.

“Is that so? Not even a friendly visit? You’re here on *business*?” The last word was marked with so much malice it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Y-yeah,” I told him. “I’m looking for a Valkyrie.”

There was a cold moment of silence, and I felt myself shiver. What had just been a heartfelt reunion spiraled into something else entirely in just a second. I could see Big G fuming as the cogs in his head turned.

“Get out.”

“W-what?”

“I said get the fuck out of my office,” he practically whispered. “I can’t believe they turned you into just another corporate bitch…”

“Corporate bitch? Uncle G, wha-?”

He slammed his fists on his desk and stood up, now shouting. “You think I’m fucking stupid!? You don’t think I can’t see what the fuck you’re doing here!? You come back after nearly a god damn decade with just a ‘oh hi, Uncle G’ and tell me that you’re just only for a fucking legend!? A myth!?”

“Uncle G, please I-” I tried to plead, but the livid man wasn’t done.

“Who sent you here, huh!? I bet it was Zephos! That’s why you completely ghosted us! After those motherfuckers all but destroyed Street Breed and threw Bison in prison for life, I bet they took you under their wing slapped on some fancy new parts! Better than that bullshit ‘parents bought them for me’ excuse! Then they sent you here chasing rumors!”

“Uncle G, do I really look like Corp to you?” I shot back, trying to find anything to calm him down and listen to me.

“Anybody can be Corps nowadays, *Nala*.” Somehow hearing him call me by my real name stung the most. He’d always called me by my old fighter name: Strawberry Thunder, and hearing him say my actual name really drove in how he felt. “Trust me, I’ve seen first hand how far those cunts will go to get what they want. But I didn’t think they’d send *you* here to butter me up.”

“I’m not Corp! I’m a Freelancer!” I tried to explain in vain.

“Oh great, so the Corps just hired you! Wow what a difference!”

“I wasn’t hired to find her! I was told she’s after the same convoy I need to knock down, and I need to ask her for help.”

“And who hired you?” he snarled. I paused and sighed.

“I can’t divulge that information…”

“Fucking *exactly.*”

I huffed and pressed my hands on his desk, leaning over and gripping the edge in frustration.

“Is there any way I can prove to you I’m not Corp?”

He glared daggers at me like I just insulted his mother. “It’s fucked that you think that’s the only issue here…” he looked away for a second, looking lost in thought before growling and continuing. “Ya know what? Fuck it, sure there’s something you can do.” My heart skipped a beat, and was hopeful for a second before my stomach dropped as he went on. “There’s a fight in an hour. A team brawl. Supposed to be our current champion and a new up-and-comer facing off against several duos. But fuck the new guy. No, I think this’ll be much more interesting with our old crowd favorite and our new champ teaming up against some of the meanest mother fuckers on the lower floors. We can see how that fancy Corp chrome works for you. You do that and *win*, you’ll get your Valkyrie.”

I looked down at my hands gripping the edge of the desk so fiercely that I could see it begin to splinter. I was shaking. Aubrey said the fights here were bad, and I hadn’t actually gotten to test my augs in real combat yet. But worst of all, if I actually did this, I’d be breaking my promise. What if I fell back into this? But still, my own words rang out in my head. A Freelancer always sees their mission through. With a heavy sigh I steeled myself and met his furious gaze with my own determined one.

“Okay.”"
"I rewatched Armitage III: Poly Matrix and the OVA and here's how it went... Someone recently asked me to elaborate on why I didn't think Armitage III: Poly Matrix or its OVA (or abysmal sequel) was a coherent story. I honestly didn't feel like elaborating at it at the time, because I felt like other people had done a better job dissecting it. But, in hunting around for a topic to discuss in my cyberpunk newsletter this month, I decided to revisit the OVA.

Here are my thoughts.

Armitage was my first cyberpunk anime. Probably the first cyberpunk thing that I ever fell in love with. I remember being obsessed with the movie. I was 12 or 13, though, so I wasn't really looking much further than the excellent OST, animation, action scenes, cool character designs, and--let's face it--anime boobs.

Every time I hear the soundtrack, it always brings back the nostalgia. I caught the movie version of Poly Matrix when I was watching the SciFi channel (back when they spelled it right).

I was blown away by the vision of a dystopian, terraformed Mars, the music, and the idea of a badass cyborg cop in hot pants. But as the years have gone on, I've seen the uncut film, the OVA, and even the sequel (Dual Matrix), and my feelings toward it have changed a lot.

Re-watching Poly Matrix and the OVA recently, I found myself unable to really follow the logic of the plot (beyond the obvious flaws, like how Armitage can't really decide whether she's a vigilante punk--which would have made waaay more sense--or a cop). The pacing is just stupid wonky. One moment, Armitage is leaping several stories from an airport terminal, landing on the killer's car as he drives away, and then the next moment she's standing behind her partner examining the corpse as if that hadn't actually happened. Her character seems to fluctuate between 12 year old girl and badass cyber cop and there doesn't seem to be much logic or forethought put between these mood switches. The murders don't make much sense, either, and the same goes for the conflict with Earth. At the time of my first viewing, I didn't know anything about the feminist movement, in fact, the way Poly Matrix paints ""feminist Earth"" as the bad guy completely flew over my head.

It would have made more sense if feminists were fighting for the rights of sentient machines sold as sex workers. Earth could have been against the idea of Mars becoming independent for many reasons, but the reasons offered in the film make no sense. This is compounded by the idea that the existence of third generation ""robots"" (they're more like cyborgs if they can give birth) a secret, and that's why these murders are happening. But the problem with this, is that the murders are all public.

Over all, if you're looking for a nostalgia trip, Armitage can fit that bill. The animation and music is great, and it's still entertaining. But the story makes no sense and seems only to serve as connecting tissue for the action scenes. Which sucks, because I could definitely imagine a great story arising from these characters had they paid more attention to the smaller details. But, both the series and the films were made in response to the success of the excellent Ghost in the Shell movie, and it was likely rushed into production as a result.

"What are some old forgotten Cyberpunk films?Hey guys, I am a sort of a fan of old movies, especially the ones from the 90s and 80s and I'd love to find some good unnoticed cyberpunk films, if there are any.

Honestly I don't even know if there are cyberpunk films except from Blade Runner, Matrix (which probably isn't cyberpunk enough), Johny Mnemonic and maybe the first Alien."
"If computers, phones, discs, storage, and the rest have a pattern of getting super small, faster, powerful, and CHEAPER....than why WOULDNT we have terminators soon?If all these electronics are getting cheaper and faster right in front of everyones face....then why is so strange for people to hear me talking about terminators? Is it because they have a different understanding of how quick technology has been getting cheaper and faster such as all these devices they own and see others using? I am curious if there is a common counter view towards this.  I think I am missing some factor which makes this all possible where people think it can shift or all of a sudden get slower?  If someone was to ask me when will terminators be around, I honestly dont know the figure off the top of my head, I mean I could go look up what Kurzwiel says, but w/o needing to do that...I feel that looking at the internet speed since dialup, and me having a startac  and now a galaxy s2 (age 26) ....its enough for me to be mind blown and think terminators like all that Boston Dynamics stuff will be around soon in the next...10 years?

* I say terminators just as a reference to something mindblowing tech wise that I think we will see...I like mentioning it because its cool to ponder about it, and I feel I have a good vision or idea of it since I think James Cameron pulled off a stunning portrayal of it. I could have said tiny phones in our tooth implants instead of terminators but yea...you get the point.

"A genre of fiction, the world we live in today.**this is a collected perspective from the responses to [my rant yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/yv4sg/tili_wasnt_a_cyberpunk/). i thought it made more sense than anything i'd say**

-----

what do you mean by: i keep running into the same problems?

Our culture accelerates towards the wall.

So many people didn't seem to expect that the corporations and businesses and the state itself would be the monstrosities that they were in works of cyberpunk science fiction. The security industrial state took over and 1984 usurped 2001. Snow Crash was mostly right. 

There's a bridge being gapped, but it doesn't feel genuine to us because as we can see right now, poverty still exists, there's still people on earth who don't even have the luxury of basic hygiene and medical supplies. Meanwhile the military industrial complex is creating surveillance drones, powerful corporations are considering augmented reality for mass-production, asteroid mining is now a thing, and so on and so forth.

Perhaps it will be a while until something which can be considered the equivalent of cyberpunk comes along. Maybe technology and the access to the Internet has to become as widespread as the radio and the TV before we can have some more ""updated cyberpunk"".

and what do you mean by: i want an accurate idea of the world i'm apart of?

Have you built a 3D printer yet?
How about a CNC machine? Programming? Got a robot yet? 

Technology: Make it yourself, asshole. That's cyberpunk as fuck. 

If you're looking for contemporary analysis, you should be hanging around people who study/work with contemporary events. People trading digital items for real cash or killing eachother over them. Some of the things described in the cyberpunk literature and films have already come to exist and some of the events have already happened.

I think you're missing that cyberpunk that is alive and real in this world.
Each discipline has to (and is) handling cyberpunk in its own real and practical way.

Honestly the basic themes of cyberpunk have never been more relevant

Why would you think a subgenre of fiction also existed in the real world? It's a very sobering feeling, realizing you no longer enjoy something you once loved. 


tl;dr OP is a fag. I kicked it in some weird Internet cafés in Thailand that are about as cyberpunk as it gets.

"Romance of SingularityHey Guys, I am big time fan of Cyberpunk, so I wanted to contribute something original for this thread since I feel the world of Cyberpunk is losing its fan base. I occasionally experiment with the idea of how love at first sight might feel or sound like in the distant future at the age of singularity. So, without further due allow me to introduce you to the Romance of Singularity. If this short story sound familiar to you or you think it was already covered in an anime, movie or novel than accept my apology since I read and watch a lot and this idea is the fruit of the influence I had over the years. Additionally, I had being working as ghostwriter for quite sometime so I felt like writing something original for myself.

Dakko K. is an ecommerce analyst at the Wall Street who specializes in predicting and analyzing Internet traffic for his clients to promote and attract new customers and ensure old customers are satisfied and happy enough to visit his client’s website again. One fine Sunday morning he headed outside for jogging to the central park, perhaps the only spot in the New York and one of the few spot in America with clean air, water and open lush greenery. The only few spots in the world where humanity can feel their union with nature.

He exits his apartment and finds the city street crowded with taxis and cyclist. He raised his head to see the sunlight but colossal building structures were obstructing his line of sight. The top of these building were covered with thick smog but the contours of these concrete towers were decorated by artificial lights and large LED sign boards. The air was thick and contaminated with poisonous pollutant - a blessing from the unregulated industries releasing poisonous gas that had made breathing difficult for Dakko and the rest of the city. Perhaps this is why the city council had made it necessary for residence to cover themselves face mask made up of nano-particles that clean the air inhaled by the user. 

Dakko starts jogging toward the Central Park as he navigates through the dense and claustrophobic city streets. The park is a 15 minute walk from his house courtesy to the newly opened city escalators design and constructed by the city council to help the elderly or Prohumans who hates augmenting their body and dislike having robotic assistance.
Dakko enters the Central Park that requires a special permit that allows individuals to use the facility 50 times a year – a move by the city council to avoid overcrowding the park and to ensure that all city dwellers could spend enough time with the nature. Dakko undergoes a retina scan and enters the park. He stretches his muscles and removes his mask as he begins jogging. He stands under the tree and begins his breathing exercise, inhaling and exhaling as hard as he can. The smell of fresh flowers and aroma makes him happy and energetic.

He begins jogging along the path, enjoying the lake view and greenery when suddenly he spots a young woman jogging his way. Dakko was mesmerized by her radiant looks and athletic figure. He keeps staring the woman and kept jogging trying to close the gap to see her up close. The woman run pass him and didn't notice Dakko staring her. Dakko stops half way and looks down at the ground with a smile at his face.  He begins following the woman, thinking of ways to introduce him and avoid making a fool out of himself. 

Dakko's heart was racing faster than him jogging which was making him more nervous. “What the hell, why am I nervous” - he thought to himself. “Hi, I am Dakko... no... to fast... Hi, you new here... dammit... what's up... oh man...” - practicing his line under his breath while running. He began following her through the lake side while maintaining his distance to avoid suspicion.

Suddenly, the woman stops and stood still. She took a deep breath and turned around and started looking at Dakko who made a quick decision and continued running. He noticed the young woman looking right at him but Dakko avoided the eye contact and started staring at the ducks on the lake. As Dakko approach near the woman, the woman stops him by blocking his path. 

“You do this all the time?” - asked the woman to Dakko with a disgusted look on her face

“I am sorry, what?” - Dakko was nervous and totally confused.

“Oh sorry, where are my manners, let me rephrase the question and ask you politely. Why the hell are you following me, you wandering loner!” -  This time there was anger in her tone but Dakko was busy noticing her oval face with pointy sharp nose and bright blue eyes.

“There is something off about her eyes... ” - Dakko wondered while the young woman was yelling at him.

“I was simply jogging. I think I am allowed to do that here.” - answered Dakko trying to act as calm as possible.

“Don't you lie to me, I saw you jogging right pass me and all of a sudden you stopped and began following me for pass 10 minutes. Are you a psychopath looking for your victim, are you a rapist or a terrorist. Wait a second, yeah, you must be one of those organ thief, I have seen many criminals on TV with your physique and those pathetic eyes says it all. Keep off me or else I am calling the security.”

“No... No... I am not an organ thief.” - Unconsciously he takes a step forward toward the woman who took Dakko's move very unwelcoming. She started screaming alerting the security. The passerby started noticing and gave a long stare at Dakko, who didn't know what to do. He looks everywhere trying to keep a calm face and wore a crooked smile while the woman was screaming for help. He had no option but to cover the woman’s mouth with his hand.

“Please, I am no stalker; I am not an organ thief either. I saw you from the distance and found you attractive. I was following you thinking of ways to start conservation with you. That's all. Now please stop screaming or else the local enforcement will throw me in jail, where I can assure you I won't survive a minute.” - Dakko whispered and reasoned with the woman and removed his hand.

The security personnel came to them immediately. “What's the problem madam?” - asked the officer while staring at Dakko. “Is he bothering you?”

“Everything is fine, officer, he is my friend and he forgot my birthday so I overreacted” - answered the woman to the unconvinced security officer who already had his right hand place on the Taser gun.

“Madam, need I remind you that you are in a public property and such act would not be tolerated in future. Is that clear?” - ordered the officer in his aggressive voice.

“I am really sorry, it won't happen again” - the officers left the two and walked away.

“I am sorry if I scared you. I should be going now” -Dakko told the woman.

“No. wait I am sorry for making a scene here. I overreacted. I owe you an apology. I am really sorry. I was over-stressed. I had an argument with my college dean so I was in a really bad mood which is why I release all my anger at you.”

“It's okay. I shouldn't have stalked you like this”

“Well. You can apologize by buying me a tea. I know a very good shop nearby?” - The woman had a smile on her face and was very apologetic.

“Yeah. Why not.” - Dakko was deeply happy and relieved at the offer.

“I am Eva by the way.”

“Dakko”

“Nice to meet you. Dakko. It’s a strange name. What does it mean?” – asked Eva curiously.

“I don’t know but I have been told that in Urdu, it means a deceit.” – answered Dakko with a smile which made Eva giggle.

“The irony” – Eva smiled back.

Both Eva and Dakko exit the Central Park and head toward the Coffee Shop that Eva suggested.

“So, do you come here regularly?” -asked Eva curiously “because I never saw you before.”

“I won't say 50 days a year is considered regular but yes I try to make use of all my days to visit the park. It is the only place where I can stay sane.”

“I know what you mean. I do the same. I just hate the fact that this is the only place in the city with trees and plants. I love trees especially the sound it makes when the wind blows through them”

“Yeah me too. My old folks use to tell me stories of a time when the city was covered with trees and plants.” There was a moment of silence. “So what do you do for living?”

“Living!” - Eva repeated with a giggle. “Well, I teach history at a university. What about you?”

“I am an analyst; I predict Internet traffic and encourage sales. Not so fun as a historian”

“Trust me, teaching history to teenagers who have no interest in the past over and over again is not fun at all. People don't share such enthusiasm you see.” - Eva explained.

Both Eva and Dakko reaches the Coffee Shop and finds themselves next to the window with the backdrop of massive LED screens displaying advertisements and giant neon signs running through the city street. They begin talking to each other, laughing and sharing their day to day stories with each other. The morning turned to afternoon with dark patches of cloud blocking the sun as if waiting for the rain to pour.
Suddenly, Dakko spotted a large mob, smashing windows and running havoc in the street. He knew who the mobs were from the symbol of their shirt. The mob belongs to anti-synthetic group, a xenophobic organization who had committed crimes against the Synthetics - an android robotic race designed by human race decades ago with a consciousness of their own. The Synthetics had been fighting for their acceptance in society by petitioning in world court and United Nation but that has met with negative response as the Synthetics are considered a slave and appliances despite having a consciousness of their own. The Anti-Synthetic organization has decommissioned thousands of Synthetics and walked away from their crime because the law doesn't recognize them as human yet.

Dakko grabs Eva's hand and hurried toward the back door.

“What happened? Where are we going?” - asked Eva but Dakko grabs her hand tightly and rushes out of the Coffee Shop and ran as far away from the crowd as possible. 

“Dakko, you are hurting me? Let go of me?” - Eva was tensed now as she didn't know what Dakko had in mind or where he was taking her. 
Dakko stopped a taxi and shoved Eva inside the taxi as he told Eva to trust him. He told the taxi driver to take them as far away from the crowed as possible which is when Eva notice the crowd outside the Coffee Shop and saw people getting beaten up by the mob. As the taxi drove away, police siren was heard ahead of the taxi. The sound of the siren was eventually getting louder as the police cars passed by the taxi. Eva was quiet throughout the ride and was constantly looking back.

“Thank you very much sir. Please stop here.” - Dakko told the taxi driver.

Both Eva and Dakko exited the taxi but Eva was silence as she stood their looking at Dakko waiting for the right moment to ask Dakko a question.

“When did you find out?” -asked Eva with moisture in her eyes.

“I was the only one wearing the face mask when we exited the park but your eyes cleared my suspicious, instead of a pupil, you have an mechanical apertures in your eyes” - answered Dakko.

“Yes, of course.” A tear drop rushed to her face but Eva immediately whipped that off with her hand. “No matter how perfect we could resemble your kind, we will still remain an imitation of life. Why didn't you say anything?”

“I was having a good time, Eva. I really enjoyed your company. And to be honest I am beginning to like you.”

“Please stop. Just stop.” Eva interrupted Dakko. “You are a nice man Dakko, you saved my life today and I don't know how could I ever repay you but you need to understand I am not a human. I am a machine, programmed to serve humanity by performing boring and repetitive task. You are attracted to this face and body which was designed so that we could look like your kind. You are my master, my creator. Your attraction to me is similar to your attraction to your mobile phone. I am an appliance Dakko. You of all people should understand this.”

“You are wrong Eva; If flash makes me a human than I am not, I should start calling myself half human too, since my entire left side is made up of prosthetics courtesy to an accident. What makes me a human and you a Synthetic? Just because I am made up of flesh and bones doesn’t necessarily mean I could be considered human by definition? If having flesh and bones makes us human then what about animals. They are made up of flesh and bones too but we don't call them humans. You can think and reason for yourself. If I lose my body and transfer my memory to a computer, will I still be considered human? We have the technology to do that Eva, than why can't you and I be together?”
There was sadness in Eva’s eyes but she was hiding her emotion. She avoided Dakko's eye contact.

“It's funny, we are program to cry but we are not program to cough and breath like your kind which makes us easily identifiable.” Eva told Dakko with a fake smile on her face. “You are a sweet man Dakko but even you don't know what you are talking about. Fire and Ice could never coexist. Please do not follow me, I beg of you. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for everything”

Eva turned her back toward Dakko and started walking. Dakko stood there looking at Eva, hoping that she would stop and look back once but she didn't. Eva disappeared in the dense maze of the concert jungle while Dakko stood there waiting and hoping.
