"[""Oh, wow. That depends on so much. As a disclaimer, I'm in no way an expert on this subject. Here are my thoughts: \n\nOne significant issue with cybernetic enhancements is our body's rejection of them. The immune response does not respond well to foreign objects. This makes it very difficult to integrate them into our body. There are some materials that the body is less prone to consider harmful, such as titanium. However, we don't make entire equipment out of one element because the mechanisms require certain properties to work (e.g., conductivity).\n\nAs far as I'm aware, and that's very limited, something like a biomechanical arm still hasn't found a great intermediary to bridge between biological and mechanical. Wires don't blend into the nervous system the same way nerves do. The entire mechanism would need to be something that functions with us to a very precise extent. \n\nThe technology itself is limited to our production capabilities. Everything has a cost. However, our bodies have developed movements from a series of systems. To do anything like a human hand, we would need a similar series of systems working together efficiently. Think of every bend a finger can do at its most capable. Every angle and continuous movement you control without external wires. A conscious thought drives a series of chemical reactions through corresponding systems to quickly change the positioning. This doesn't even describe the underlying structural support. \n\nOutside of fantasy, technology has pretty severe shortcomings, which increases cost. Our hands repair themselves to a very high extent. On average, they are sufficiently durable. However, a broken cybernetic harm requires a technician. The more complex the instrument is, the greater the cost to fix it. It doesn't heal itself. While we can make very durable instruments, I don't know of any in which precision isn't inversely related to resistance. A hand that can move in a complex series of motions requires a bunch of small parts, and those small parts are comparatively fragile. Think about even slapping a desk. The force with which you can slap it without breaking your hand, and the theoretical number of times one could do that without permanent damage. We don't have anything like that. I can't slam a controller on a desk without impacting its functioning. \n\nWe haven't gone into other marvels the human body has such as sensation, but we're sacrificing that in favor of robotics. However, the corresponding consequence is how can we tell whether the internal mechanisms need replacements? Would we use the arm until it simply stops working? If we want to tell, we'll need sensors and programming to indicate status. That becomes another beast to build. \n\nThe issues above are off the top of my head as well. I'm sure there are even more considering the necessary fields in development (i.e., physics, engineering, computer science, etc.). \n\nI think the most telling state of progress is reflected by what's available. I've never seen or heard of anything in reality akin to cybernetic organs. At best, we have placed technology onto pre-existing biological structures to regulate their performance. Therefore, in a way, that's our current progress. It's hardly on the level of Cyberpunk, but it does surpass some prosthetic devices.""]"
"[""That helps me clarify somewhat what's going on. You might add some loose cabling coming out of the socket then, help make it clearer what the hell's going on there.\n\nIs she entirely robotic then? Because that's deep enough I'm starting to get concerned that she seems to have no internal organs left whatsoever.""]"
"['Uhm, yes. What do you call people who steal things and then use them to cause harm to other people?    \nCome on, this is the real world, not some anarchist fantasy. Hackers aren\'t heroic rebels trying to bring down totalitarian oppressors. Most of them would rather work for, or even become oppressors themself, given the means and an opportunity. And as our world becomes more digitalized, ""smarter"" as the corps call it, the means and opportunities to oppress are steadily increasing for everybody.\n\nLet me tell you something about priviliges:    \nTo think that there\'s only one kind of brutish thug you need to worry about.    \nTo think that a gun can protect you, even though a bullet that started flying your way won\'t stop no matter what you\'re carrying.    \nAnd to be more afraid of a dog that can\'t even bite than about someone who would hold all your digital property hostage, empty your bank accounts and sell information about your physical location to others who intent to take away or cause harm to your physical property, or even to yourself.\n\nI dread the day that robots with guns would be allowed to walk amongst us, because then the day that someone hijacks one to go on a remote shooting spree at no risk of being hurt themself won\'t be far away anymore either.    \nMeanwhile, thugs with guns being replaced with robots without guns is rather low on my list of things to worry about.']"

"[""the only way cyberpunk is exclusively dystopia, is if utopia is actually possible as a concept. because utopia is not possible, ALL societies are dystopia, and the term loses all meaning. Instead, Define cyberpunk by all the markers of what makes a cyberpunk setting cyberpunk. Here's just a few of the marker/tentpoles that make cyberpunk that I have noticed\n\n* Technology can be used in malicious and unexpected ways\n* Artificial augmentation of the body is possible\n* A sub-glass of artificial people have been created, be it clones, replicants, robots, or an impoverished underclass, which are utilized by society as slave labor to some capacity\n* Said subclass periodically has individuals or groups which go rogue and rebel \n* Hunters for rebel slaves are created and are often also of this artificial slave-class they hunt. \n* People who treat people as objects\n* neo-colonialism\n* Government conspiracy\n* the intersection of mental disorder and crime as a key thematic element\n* Technology is blamed for societal problems, when society itself is the root cause\n* blurring of the distinction between man and machine\n* philosophical questions on the nature of consciousness and identity\n* does AI qualify for personhood?\n* ...and much, much more\n\nNot every cyberpunk series checks every one of these boxes, but in order to be cyberpunk, you must check a lot of these. There is some threshold of what qualifies as cyberpunk. A Fantastic litmus test for this, is the comparison of Blade Runner, with Megaman\n\nyou have a human society, that has created an artificial worker class that from the outside looks approximately human, which are themselves self-aware agents, that are utilized as a disposable un-paid labor class (slaves). Then at some point, through exposure to ideas from people, or through self-determination, some of these artificial people refuse to continue being slaves, and attempt to start a revolution. Then the society that creates them, creates a new sub-group of people dedicated to hunting down rogues, which are themselves, also the same artificial person that they hunt. \n\nboth blade runner and megaman follow this plot. (even if you consider the sequel canon, the protagonist is a replicant blade runner in that one). The difference between blade runner and megaman, is that blade runner is a dystopia, but megaman is not.\n\n***TL;DR original Megaman is a non-dystopian cyberpunk.***"", 'Yeah that\'s fair.. idk never really liked people using the word ""punk"" after something when they mean aesthetic. Steampunk isn\'t really punk at all, it\'s retrofuturisim. Cyberpunk is rooted in the very real threat that late stage capitalism is, just a bit over the top lol. It\'s just regular punk with robotic implants and shit. Steampunk doesn\'t have that kind of anarchist rage towards oppression that punk does.']"

"['Clear just started, issue 2 is out this week IIRC. Haven\'t gotten around to reading issue 1 yet, but it\'s definitely cyberpunk.\n\nThere\'s a new Batman Beyond comic starting up, I\'d expect cyberpunk aesthetic if nothing else. Actually, for that matter, the recent Batman story, Failsafe, had some cyberpunk elements to it, but I\'d be hard pressed to call it a cyberpunk story.\n\nThere\'s also a couple ongoing Blade Runner series, but I haven\'t read those either. Gonna start grabbing the trades for them instead.\n\nI\'ve heard Department of Truth called cyberpunk, but I haven\'t read it myself to see if that\'s true. Not sure if that\'s actually still going either.\n\nNot All Robots ended last year, but while it\'s lacking much of the aesthetic, it\'s definitely a cyberpunk story. Basically, humanity has reached a point where robots do all the work, and some of the robots start to resent them.\n\nThere\'s been several comic tie-ins for Cyberpunk 2077, and I expect there will be more. Trauma Team follows a member of Trauma Team. You Have My Word is a revenge story. Blackout follows a BD author trying to make things better. There\'s a couple more I haven\'t read. None are ongoing though.\n\nA couple years back, DC did ""Far Sector"" which deals with a new Green Lantern assigned to an isolated city. There\'s some heavy cyberpunk aesthetics, and a fair bit of the story is cyberpunk or cyberpunk-adjacent. The main meat of the story involves class warfare and the lead has an AI friend, leading to an issue taking place in a digital construct. Easily the best thing DC\'s done in a long time, IMO. N.K. Jemisin did the writing, if you\'re familiar with her.']"
"[""I think it's interesting, I think if you look at cyborgs as passing a certain threshold on the spectrum of man to machine, Smart watches and smart phones definitely are putting people somewhere on the spectrum closer to machine, than they were before. After the more people rely on those features to do basic everyday tasks the most these devices assume the role that any other appendage might. Many people would risk their life to save their smart device, have violent reactions to it being broken, and practically can't live without it. In this sense, I would say that things like this definitely qualify to some level. \n\nIf you strictly define cyborgs as having robot parts that attach to the body, then no, but I think that's a bit vague. But I don't really like this definition. Prosthetics is a reason for instance, that causes me some doubt. Some more robotic limb replacements definitely would get us closer to the image of a cyborg, but what is the difference between a high quality robotic arm,   and a pirate's peg leg? Both have to some extent be accepted by the body and have to function in a certain way. \n\nI think it ultimately depends on your definition. There is a way to look at cyborgs as requiring the connection between key functions of the body and devices to be connected and controlled dependently. If that's the case then I would say no.""]"

"[""AIB-750-890, a Kasawi Type 750 Warmaster, was produced in an autofactory years after mankind vanished from reality during the Unexpected Interrupt.

Battle after battle, 890 would devise increasingly convoluted strategies to achieve victory.
