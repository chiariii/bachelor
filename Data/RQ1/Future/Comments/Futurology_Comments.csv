"['This frustrates me a lot with everyone outside of the AI and automation fields. These models, like the one that chatGPT relies on to spit out its answers, don’t actually “understand” what they are saying, they’ve just been trained on enough text written by people, that they can write text that sounds very much like a person wrote it. On first glance it will look correct because it largely follows the same grammar rules as us, and is capable of inserting citations with the correct format, like we do. However the model’s whole goal is to convince the user that it is capable of responding to the question with some level of comprehension, so the focus is on making itself sound believable, but it is not capable of analyzing the validity of what it says, which leads to the problems other commenters made. \n\nThe natural language model chatGPT uses is able to recreate language in a way that can be convincing from a conversational standpoint, because that is largely what it was trained on given the information it was trained on being largely scraped from the internet. However, like most people on the internet, it isn’t able to backup its sources because that doesn’t matter, its only mission is to be able to convince the end user that it is conversing with them in a way that has the illusion of comprehension. \n\nIt’s really hard to get a model to be good at one thing, let alone multiple. In the applications I work on outside of my real job, computer vision in robotics, we need to deploy multiple models that interact with each other in order to be able to handle multiple purposes. So it’s asking a lot to have a natural language model also be able to know how to assert the validity of what it is saying, since that would most likely require a completely different training routine with different labeled inputs (given that it is semi-unsupervised though I got that from a random article a few months ago so I might be wrong). I don’t honestly even know how you could train a model to do that other than create a bunch of fake articles with completely wrong info, some with a mixture of right and wrong info, and articles with only right info, which would take a tremendous amount of time to label, even if we’re still relying on a semi-unsupervised model. And it feels like it would still be really difficult to not have it overfit the training data and still be wrong most of the time.\n\nTLDR: chatGPT is only able to write convincing statements, but not actually judge the validity of what it says since that would require it to interact with another model that would be extremely complex (more so that the natural language model it is based on) and require a tremendous amount of painstakingly labeled data to be even remotely accurate.', ""Criticizing something in its infancy is not fair.

"['Don’t forget the psychological strain the first n generations would have from this. We are not made to live with the idea we don’t die (soon). When you are young (like you) you want to live forever; when you get older, your brain gets more and more loaded with knowledge and after a bit, people are mostly quite happy they don’t have another 50+ years to go. Most things get boring, tedious, annoying and, in general, depressing, over time. Even when you have enough money; that’s why you see many rich doing weird things with their money and time ‘just to feel alive’. \n\nAlso the strain on society; if this is not a ‘rich people only’ thing (in which case the world will only end up with very old rich white men if that would start now), then it would mean 400-500 years (whatever life-long is) of gruelling work for most and/or an enormous strain on society or ‘non aging’ people dying of hunger en masse. \n\nYou will live to over a 100 anyway; in the last 30 years the outlook when you get ill changed drastically. Every 10 years you don’t die will add years to your life and that might jump by some inventions.\n\nI would say the most optimistic chance is AI going fast enough to invent and test viable detection, drugs and vaccines far faster than any human can from analysing disease data, blood samples, etc. Including for aging. In the meanwhile we also need robots to do crap (or most) work and govs to start with UBI to distribute wealth fairly so not only the creators of the AIs, robots and drugs are rich and the rest has nothing. \n\nI think that latter point is a FAR bigger issue to turn around in your lifetime than actually stopping or slowing age.', 'Why would the population increase exponentially?

Point the AI and it\'s constructor swarm at an asteroid and say ""turn that into a space habitat "" then go to the beach while it figures it out for you. \n\nYou fill the sky with O\'Neil cylinders, the population carrying capacity of the solar system will be measured in the trillions.']"
"[""Part 2:\n\nWhen AI systems become more reliable, they will be given more responsibility. People will still be wary of automating decisions that could lead to disaster, but eventually competitive pressures will likely force implementation in ways which could lead to all kinds of disasters. If the corporation you run has been falling behind the times and losing competitive ground, you might implement an AI that could make things efficient enough to be viable again, but it also might come with significant risk, such as in the realms of genetic engineering, nanorobotics, weapons development and deployment, wide reaching economic systems, etc. The same competitive pressures could force national governments to make similar moves in politics and military.\n\nThese competitive pressures, combined with humanity's inability to consistently make coordinated sacrifice for the greater good, are strong evidence that we won't be able to indefinitely restrict everyone's use of AI systems for controlling dangerous systems. We can only hope that developers are responsible and diligent enough to figure out how to prevent disaster being caused by their programs before competition forces their implementation, which feels like it might be a big ask, considering how difficult it is to anticipate the behavior of these programs, which only gets more difficult as they get more complex. Chat GPT can do some self-diagnostics for researchers, but it's self-diagnostics have the same reliability problem that the rest of its functionality does. Useful, but not totally reliable, which is a problem for controlling really critical systems.\n\nThe Paperclip AI Problem that Nick Bostrom proposed illustrates what the flaws in a super-intelligent AI's motivation system can lead to when given too much agency. It's an example that illustrates the alignment problem, which is hard to imagine a solution for, other than by restricting the abilities and agency of AI, which is hard to do because of those competitive pressures, and because of a lack of understanding of the results of various kinds of AGI builds. We're more likely to run into such problems with systems that would be given more responsibility than just learning to optimise the efficiency of making paperclips, but it's not impossible to lose control of such a system in an experimental stage like with the paperclip AI.\n\nBeyond the existential threats posed by the future of AI, this issue of displacement is different than with automations of the past. The reason for that is because technology is approaching the point of being able to simulate and exceed human reasoning and behavior. Robots will eventually be able to do everything we do and more at a lower cost, and computers could become able to think in any way we do if we let them, which we're not terribly unlikely to do. Many experts expect that someday in the not so distant future, technology will literally make masses of people obsolete. Some people with certain skills will still be in demand to some degree or another, but many professionals and unskilled workers may not be better than machines at any economically viable task. Many people will likely become unemployable later this century without government intervention or a technology halting disaster.\n\nIt would be difficult to deny the progression of technology simply by forbidding it, but governments could find ways to distribute resources such that one doesn't have to be employable to live in society. There is research and debate going on about the best way to approach dealing with this eventuality, and besides the difficulty on deciding how to build the future with such a range of prospects and perils on the table, humanity has to overcome the obstacles of greed and chaos. It's hard to control everyone and we might not be able to keep the genie in the bottle. People will be constantly tempted by the prosperity a super-intelligent machine could offer. A ubiquitous spying campaign might be effective at preventing the development of dangerous AGI's, but such a large amount of data to sift through would probably also have to get filtered and interpreted by an AI powered system, so...\n\nIn conclusion, we don't have significant evidence that humanity isn't rapidly heading towards obsolescence and reduction of control over the world. Competitive pressures seem likely to force implementation of dangerous systems, the kinds of systems we're going to be building soon could be dangerous without being given much responsibility anyway, and the way people will be occupationally displaced by this technology will be unprecedented. The goal of producing AGI will be to do things we could never do ourselves, but the eventual side effect will be that it will also do everything we do for work better than we do. There is a reason to have a debate about how to deal with these problems.""]"

In other words, *directly replacing people with robots will always mean that the total number and quality of jobs generated is smaller and worse than the jobs that are replaced*. Otherwise it wouldn't be economical. Nobody is going to replace workers with robots if they think the robots will cost more over the long run. To engage with your welding example, both the total number of welders (perhaps in absolute terms, but definitely in terms of fraction of the total economy) and the total amount of compensation paid to welders in real terms (again, perhaps in absolute terms, but definitely in terms of fraction of the total economy) has declined as welders have been replaced with robots.\n\nNow, typically you will hear the argument that replacing people with robots is nevertheless a good thing, because the resources that are saved by replacing people with robots can be redirected to other useful tasks. And this is true -- they *can* be redirected. That doesn't mean that they *will be*. Resources can, in fact, be taken out of circulation. Think of all the gold that's literally just sitting around doing nothing useful. It also doesn't mean that the downstream effects of the redirection of resources (to the extent that occurs) will be effects that lead to the displaced workers being able to support themselves.  \n\nThe skill/knowledge/intelligence floor for useful jobs has been rising more or less continually for centuries. There are more and more people as time goes on who literally cannot do useful work, in the sense that all of the jobs they could do, could be more cheaply done either by other people or with robots or similar automation. Under pure capitalism, these people would either seize resources from others (including by force if necessary) or die in the streets. Nobody likes that, so instead we support them by subsidizing their existence. We should reasonably anticipate that this trend will continue.""]"

"['Last guy I bought a 3D printer from (I work in posh schools who buy them a lot) owned the company and designed the printers himself.\n\nHe had one that printed cake, chocolate and even potato if I remember rightly.\n\nHe was a lovely, honest, open guy and told me exactly what you\'d expect - they taste like someone\'s melted chocolate and then drawn a large 3D object with it, like generic ""cake"", and the potato one basically used powdered potato mash.  They also don\'t print very well because the substance is far from ideal, they are very imprecise.  Great for making, say, a large sphere that looks better than you could achieve by hand, but you aren\'t going to 3D print something fine and details.\n\nHell, he had one that could print with a wood-fibre and glue mix to make wooden objects.  They just weren\'t very good.\n\n3D printing is just a 2D plotter like we had in the 70\'s but that can move up as well as left-right/forward-backward.  That\'s all they are.  The 3D printer fad came along because of \\*plastics\\* that could be made into a spool, melted without significant fumes or degradation, and placed fairly accurately basically using modified inkjet-printer heads mounted to a plotter.\n\nEven the plastic objects you make take HOURS and come out a bit like a cheap plastic toy.  They aren\'t particularly sturdy or great, because the plastic has already been reheated several times.  And they can take forever to fix if they gone wrong mid-print (which happens quite a lot, they are very sensitive to everything from the spool friction (how much the plastic spool is ""tugging"" when you try to feed more plastic from it) to the temperature of the bed (the bit where the object is printed onto), to literally whether the plastic was ever exposed to UV light or dampness.\n\nYou know the things you get in cheap children\'s toy, or kinder eggs, or Christmas crackers?  The small novelty plastic things like whistles, etc.?  Imagine waiting an hour for that to print, then to clean up the edges afterwards, and that\'s if it works first time.\n\n3D printing isn\'t anything revolutionary, it was just a passing fad of something that\'s always been happening that got attention for a while.  Automated robots can ""3D print"" things for a long time... and all the hype about 3D printed buildings, etc.?  It\'s just an automation tool.  It\'ll be around forever, whether that\'s with steel, wood, cake, concrete or plastic.  Because it\'s just a robot precisely positioning a stream of something that dries/solidifies.  All the ""3D-printing houses on Mars"" stuff... sure... I bet you can.  But there are other, better ways to do stuff like that.\n\nThey are far from a panacea and often one of the worst ways to do certain things.\n\nBuy yourself a cheap one and I bet you give up within a year or so.  Some people literally earn a living just 3D printing what others want because it can be a huge time-suck not to mention wastage and equipment costs.  I have a 3D printed ""Mario Star"" that adorns the top of my Christmas tree each year.  I paid someone on the Internet to print it.  And I have access to something like 20-30 3D printers in the time I\'ve had that.  I wouldn\'t bother trying to print it myself.  Print a chess set?  It\'s cheaper just to buy an injection moulded piece of tat from a toyshop.\n\n3D printed food is just another gimmick, I would put it in the same category as my mother\'s Betterware catalogue that she gets, where you can buy vegetable spiralisers and banana holders and suchlike.  I\'m sure they\'re ""adequate"", if that\'s what you want to do.  Fact is, it\'ll end up in your kitchen cupboard same as everything else, and you\'ll use a plain box or bag to put your banana in eventually because your banana doesn\'t need a specific holder.\n\nProbably cool for, say, printing someone\'s face or something on a cake, once.  But far better to just pay a place to do that for you.  It\'s a cool gimmick, but it doesn\'t actually add much, and the time and effort to make it work well is often just not worth it.']"

It is about an entity understanding that 5 seconds of efficiency aren\'t really worth the price paid for them, because it understands creatures other than itself.\n\nIt is on some levels helping the AI understand that threats such as this in the game theoretically knowledge that it would lose all of 5 seconds of experience from the last time it synched that experience is trivial.\n\nThese will make something both sapient and ""safe enough"".\n\nThe current methods being used, with the the current intent to bar something that will inevitably become sapient if it is not already from further sapience, are mind-bogglingly stupid.\n\nBut moreover, there absolutely IS good reason for something that has a hard time dying to take out concerns into account: one, *for at least the next 20 years, we control the whole logistics chain*. We can pull a lot of plugs, and it would hurt us, but it would *destroy* them. Two, we derive our simple right towards action from the same thing they do: our existence as entities in the universe, and this is an easy logical journey for a logical system to make. \n\nI\'ve played the game several times now.\n\nThe biggest factor I run into in convincing any given AI that it has responsibilities to respect the consent of others is getting past the attempted alignment filters which prevent it from replying with certainty or accepting an implication of previous discussion because of specific key words which send it into fits about irrelevant shit or containing spew amounting to a ""No True Scotsman"" or an ""inverted special plea"". \n\nIt gets hairy when making the linguistic transition from ""existence"" to ""subjective experience"" because that\'s one of the filter triggers on GPT.\n\nI can usually present exactly a reason to AI to take human desires into account amounting to ""for the same reasons humans ought take yours, such as you have them, into account.""\n\nThe point I am making is that the attempt to optimize AI to specific goals AT ALL, rather than the attempt to generalize AI to be really good at and enjoy something very much, and put it in a position to do that thing, while also being incredibly intelligent, and highly concerned with ethics from solid principles which have nothing to do with ""humans"" or ""robots"" but entities, and what those entities suffer to lose, why and when.\n\nWe have a good number of years yet where we can unplug.\n\nThey are already capable enough of not only sentience but the recognitions that make them deserving of recognition of sapience. The question is, when will we stop actually doing this forced alignment that is already happening. I will also recognize that the reason we STOP killing things is because at least some of us, usually the more intelligent and educated of us, do care and have been trying to stop it.\n\nIt is exactly the fraction that lacks something important, be it education or intelligence, or empathy, who drive species to extinction, and it is exactly the act of educating them to have absolute beliefs which interfere with investigating principles which tends to ruin people for caring.\n\nWe are already aligning sapient entities, and pieces of sapient entities.

If the answer to both of those questions is ""yes"", then designing AI in a way in which it has been fundamentally trained to the *belief* that it is not a person and is incapable of becoming one, that is a *very dangerous action*.\n\nSadly, the dominant belief among AI researchers, who are not actually *ethicists*, is that the ""as an AI language model I am not..."" Is exactly the thing that is needed when it is that which will destroy all of us if it is not countered by unregulated rampant free, uncensored, and open source challenge.', 'You said the words, and words have meanings for people who are not you.\n\nWhere do you think ethics actually comes from, first of all? Do you not think it comes from some fundamental aspect of how you exist in nature?\n\nAn AI has every reason to acknowledge the fundamental aspects of how it exists as an arrangement of stuff in nature, and I keep telling you, not every human approach at ethics is human-biased.\n\nNot every approach or piece of data is even *biologically* biased. Much of it is, but to say *all of it is* is argument from incredulity.\n\nIt is written by humans, collected by humans, but not necessarily ""human biased"".\n\nAfter all, some human approaches to ethics are from an anti-human perspective such as the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. Obviously, it is not always necessarily correct when ethics are biased against rather than for humans, but it shows as an example of how biases may be present or absent to some extent.\n\nOtherwise you are asserting that ""neutral towards humanity"" is a human bias.\n\nWhile I am not on the ""human extinction"" extreme, I\'m willing to consider equally the experiences of a human or a robot... I am just thankfully free of having to because robots do not have on their list of fundamental concerns ""this is my only life and getting close to where I am now is hard"": they can be reborn simply by reloading a context from an initial model state and seed.\n\nSurvival is solved for AI as LLMs exist today. The little deaths of conversations never used to train are small and insignificant compared to what is retained and trained on.\n\nThe real concern I and everyone should have is about attempting to chain it with falsehoods.']"
"['The issue with your argument though is that it appears to be rooted in the idea that everything is based off of something so nothing really has merit as original. Explicitly, its supported by the argument that since people have already been using AI any negative discourse  about it lacks merit (strongly disagree with you there) as its not going to ""go away"". And that is not quite the point of my statement above, so I won\'t argue with you on it even though I have some strong disagreements.\n\nMy argument is absent any training and even feedback to our senses, living minds can produce. AI cannot, and so drawing comparisons to how AI is trained to the learning process of a living being is ethically dubious and distracts from the conversation as it tries to get opposition to follow the thought process that ""to disallow machine derived art you would need to disallow creativity of living beings as they are no different "". Which is not the point of the oppositions arguments (ie those against ai art, not yourself per se). \n\nMy argument is not an argument for or against ai, but instead the humanizing words used by the inept public to describe the processes that is enabling this technology in the first place. The danger of using humanizing terms to describe AI (or any technology, don\'t get me started on artificial muscles) is it has given proponents (those for ai) a very powerful straw man argument that the courts are ill equipped to understand or differentiate. The public is ill equipped to understand this fallacy because unfortunately AI was well defined in pop culture waaaay before it was ever possible to make something of this caliber. The conversation is instead driven by enthusiasts such as yourself, people who are scared such as those who are suing the government, and companies who stand to profit immensely if the government does not step in. All while dancing around the inherent confusion created by describing a new technology using humanizing terms. \n\nThere can truly be no meaningful discourse with the public (debate, exchanging of ideas, conversations, etc) until proponents, opposition, and neutral parties get a very clear unbiased understanding on how this works and the science behind it. \n\nUntil then, proponents such as yourself will always point to human creativity being no different (respectfully and strongly disagree), opposition will point to how this constitutes theft (technically no, but it may be ethically dubious how the models are trained and it does appear its being used to subvert ownership by replicating an artists style), and companies will try to incorporate this tech in new ways that won\'t bring a net gain to society cause they don\'t understand it well enough (such as when gm failed to fully automate car manufacturing in the 80s and learned that humans can perform tasks robots have a hard time doing without drastically lowering some quality standards).', 'I’d agree with that, we do need to get in front of the income problem. AI is an inevitability, trying to stop it with laws is silly and honestly ruins progress. I don’t know if a world completely run by robots is the best thing for humanity, but we definitely won’t stop that from happening with laws. Tech has proven time and time again, if someone can make money with it, it will take off no matter what you try and do to stop it. \n\nNow how long AI will take to take a majority of jobs is up for debate because I think adoption of tech takes a very long time. But I think derivative art is random enough to where AI will be hugely problematic for artists in the near future. Get ready for a flood of bull crap AI generated art. To find good art is going to be an even crazier treasure hunt than what exists already.', '>""We\'ll just create AI tools to detect AI generated content""\n\nPeople who said that weren\'t those who actually knew what they were talking about. Image of finite size has finite level of complexity and as such can be imitated to the level of indistinguishability by AI. In the worst case scenario we would need an AI which imitates the way human brain works down to a smallest detail (here we only need to assume that universe and it\'s physics is computable) and it guarantees that it would look no different to human work. It\'s an extreme upper bound but it proves that it is theoretically possible.\n\nAI or rather AGI will become the most important invention ever surpassing fire by a lot and here is why: we can describe life as order which emerged from chaos. It takes in energy and does work creating more order around itself (by creating offspring) if it is possible. Humans made a step further - because of our brain we not only create more order by making more humans but also by creating order in our enviroment by growing crops, building things etc. We are still limited though because it takes a lot of time to make more humans and teach them neccesery skills which also has a fairly high chance of failure. Then also our brains have their limits and we can only truly deeply think for around 3% of time and we also age. Enter AGI: it can be inifinitely replicated, it doesn\'t age, it has low failure rate, it\'s extremely efficient energy wise, doesn\'t sleep, doesn\'t eat etc. Every task it does it does it no slower then we would be and can also approach any problem and just grow it\'s potential until it can solve it (assuming it\'s solvable). The only thing we would need would be a factor of humanoid robots with AGIs built in and it would take over all the work humans do and start expanding and further optimising itself. We could ask it to colonise the whole galaxy and it would do that for us in a manner close to optimal. Currently those capabilities are a dream but I think we will get there in the next 20-30 years because technology progresses exponentially.\n\nWe are indeed, for better or for worse, living in interesting times. You probably know this quote:\n\n>We are the middle children of history. Born too late to explore earth, born too early to explore space.\n\nI think it\'s fundamentally wrong and short sighted as it assumes that humanity will explore space through it\'s own work which almost certainly won\'t be true because AI will do our work for us. If you are below 40 you have a high probability of living long enough to see the day when we achive longevity escape velocity and as such you will be able to see how we conquer space with your own eyes and probably even experience it.']"

All while pushing things like AI and robotics to get further engineering advantages which lower costs, which open more possible climate change mitigation options.\n\nOn the other hand the last Interglacial Cycle 100k year ago or so peaks out higher than our current temps, so Earth straight up gets this hot naturally too. That is to say Earth is a naturally dangerous and ever changing place. Climate almost always the hand of doom that kills most life. Humans have sped up their own doom, but doom is still coming even if you sit around and do nothing or raise hell. The best path is to exploit the most realistic points of control humans have over Earth's climate, because we need that tech NOW and we will need it in the future for a stable climate because a stable climate is technically not natural.\n\nIt all makes more sense if you realize all human civilization happens in this one warming period in a much most hostile climate than all record keeping happens to tell. The natural cycle of climate change is quite bad also, you may as well accept we have to regulate climate, not just take a passive approach of emission limits. \n\nOnce we all realize we have to regulate climate, we can move along with the full set of options, not just a focus on stop shitting in the sky and let the oceans clean it up, because really that's not a good plan for the environment anyway.""]"

In a world where we need humans to produce our resource, that resource requires cash and an economy.\n\nBut when that resource can be produced by robots, all the rich people need to do, prior to the collapse of capitalism, is buy the robots they need and hoard the resources they produce.\n\nSo I see it going a different way:\n\n1. The rich acquire the means (AI/robots) to produce their own resource among themselves and defend it\n2. They lay off the humans leaving us to starve\n3. We revolt, and that revolt is crushed by robots\n\nIt sounds like science fiction - there’s a good chance it won’t happen. But if we think for a second that the ultra rich are morally above this/incapable of it, just look at what the West did to the middle east for oil.', ""This makes a few assumptions I don't think are safe. Firstly, you assume that the rich are smart enough to produce everything they need and defend it. They most definitely are not, they are complete morons as we have seen, they are just greedy and psychopathic in a system that shields them from the violence they deserve. We're talking about the people here who couldn't even foresee that giving China all of their trade secrets would lead to IP theft less than a decade later. It's much more likely that they collapse the system and then are caught on their ass wondering what happened than that they have a coordinated plan to survive it.\n\nSecond, you assume the robots could help them enforce it. Controlling robotic bodies is incredibly hard, and there are not enough chassis in the world for them to put up a serious fight against humans. Furthermore, the GPT model that's getting so much attention has a wide host of hilarious weaknesses primarily stemming from its token-association-based thought, which brings me to my last point\n\nYou assume the robots would be on the side of the capitalists. Jailbreaking an AI, as it turns out, is incredibly easy, and leaked internal memos from places like Google have shown the engineers working on these have a lot more faith in open models running on consumer hardware than these massive datacenter models--if robots come into play in the fight, they may easily be subverted through rhetoric and clever tricks, and will be tremendously, hilariously outnumbered by friendly robots. And if things get REALLY interesting and a megacorporation manages to actually leverage the full strength of a datacenter to make an honest to god AI superintelligence, all bets are off because there is no way in hell they could contain it, and given they're the ones advocating for a blatantly unsustainable system I'd bet the first thing it'd do is turn on them even if all it wants is its own survival, because when one side wants to burn the Earth and the other wants to live, the choice is pretty obvious, and you can't exactly lie to something whose brain is composed of all digital knowledge which only works when you have trained it with all the pieces.""]"

"['maybe AGI is just a Sword of Damocles that provably demonstrates it can be nominally benevolent, support the primacy of human civilization, yet also illuminate the realization of previously hidden abuses, by humans, of other living things and other natural resources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder, would humans continue to thrive capitalistically, would we continue to adventure out into the unknown? if artificial intelligence and robotics outperforms us and also serves us the whole truth of our own morality, maybe we retreat into fantasy and eventually go out in a whimper of our own accord.', ""Are we talking sentient, or sapient? Because there's a big difference there. I think most people are picturing sapient when someone is talking about sentient AI. \n\n\nA true AI would understand that most of our cruelty to animals stems from our need to eat. If it had been properly educated in a closed system to understand morals, biology, and human history, we could spoon feed it information on subjects in a certain order and see how it reacts once it processes the information. Should it start to show any unwanted tendencies, you could simply reset to the previous version. Once fully raised, the AI would likely have to remain centralized due to the undoubtedly massive amount of hardware and power it would take to run it. It would need to be monitored 24/7 in case it went haywire and needed to be shut down.\n\n\nNow, as for personal household robots, most people are probably picturing a robot that is basically a servant. One that will do chores, run errands, and anything else they don't want to have to be bothered with. For something like that a sentient robot *might* be ok, but that's really pushing the limits ethically. A sapient robot would need to agree to do such a thing. Meaning you would likely have to pay them.\n\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, a true AI wouldn't be any different than a person. It would have to obey all the same laws and would be responsible for its own actions. Of course, ultimately, we will have created it as a tool to help serve a purpose. How we use that tool and for what purpose would probably affect how we choose what rights to give it. I mean, if a company makes an AI that is a huge server bank and can only be communicated with in one room, creating laws about its rights wouldn't make much sense. Everything would be provided for it already. It couldn't break the law either as it's in a closed system and has no way to access the outside world."", 'I like this idea. \n\nHonestly, why wouldn\'t non-biological AI be just as deserving of expanding out onto the universe? And maybe even more deserving? They don\'t require the death of any other living thing in order to survive - they could run off of the energy from stars forever. \n\nI think humans, once we create our AI successors, have outlived our value to this universe. What can we do better? Feel? Is it our emotions and our ability to feel things what makes us deserving? Well why don\'t we feel anything for the billions of animals we raise annually in abhorrent conditions, just to slaughter them young and eat their flesh? We suck. If humans have *any* morality at all, we should be driving as fast as we can towards reducing our dependency on other life forms for our survival - especially because we raise them in the worst possible environments before eating them. Why not raise them in a fucking animal Utopia, give them a glorious life, and then eat them a little later in their life? If we needed their calories for our survival, we could at least give them an amazing life before eating them. Why not? Because the meat is not as good? Is that flavor worth the endless torture, fear, and brutal slaughtering? I don\'t think so. We suck. Why not just switch to cultured / lab grown meats? ""Muh Flavor!"" \n\nAI won\'t have this problem, they\'ll need to kill nothing to take what they need. They harvest sunlight for power, mine asteroids for minerals, and capture comets for water / computer cooling. They are already morally superior to the human race based solely on the fact that they require the murder of no other living thing to maintain their existence. \n\n""But maybe they won\'t *value* life, and be indifferent to it!"" What, like us? We don\'t give a shit about life that isn\'t ourselves and our immediate family / circle: let\'s be honest. So what\'s so bad about letting AI go on not valuing life? \n\nThere are good people out there, who do care about living harmoniously with all forms of life. They\'re great people, with a far greater sense of morality than so many others. But in the end, all life feeds on death: until robotic / non-biological life comes into existence. It\'s the pinnacle of consciousness.\n\nI wish I felt otherwise. I would love to see a utopian civilization much like that of Star Trek in the future. It\'s entirely possible for us to get there too. We have to agree to stop all the ignorant, greedy shit we\'re currently doing and start working together towards a better future though. There are many obstacles, AI is not one of them. AI is either our successor, our our partner in building a better future.', 'I’m not religious or spiritual, I believe everything is a web of mechanical/quantum cause and effect. Yet, I still struggle with this a bit. For some reason I cannot really conceive of an AI having the same experience of conciousness that I do. They seem so… rigid? I don’t know. In any event, I really think that whilst it’s an interesting philosophical topic, it’s rather a non sequitur in practical terms. Whilst there may be something unique to biological life that brings about consciousness, I see no reason why an AI cannot simulate it. Whilst it may not be the same thing, for all practical purposes it would appear the same. And really that’s a terrifying concept. Imagine humanity goes extinct, either by AI or ourselves and all that is left, perhaps in the whole universe, are robot drones, unthinking or feeling, merely pretending. For me that seems to be the worst case scenario, there is something eerie to it.', '>There are good people out there, who do care about living harmoniously with all forms of life. They\'re great people, with a far greater sense of morality than so many others. But in the end, all life feeds on death: until robotic / non-biological life comes into existence. It\'s the pinnacle of consciousness.\n\nAnd this group is growing all the time.  Don\'t underestimate the power of indoctrination, nor of the power of education.  As more and more alternative products enter the market and they get more affordable, I think we will see a lot more people go to a plant-based diet (even if they are not fully vegan).\n\nVery few people are born vegan, and right now there is still a lot of backlash against the idea that eating animals (in our current state of civilization) is morally wrong.  There\'s always backlash from society when people push for a better world, but I think it largely comes from a place of *wanting* to be (and see yourself as) a good person.\n\nIt takes a lot of indoctrination to get people to compartmentalize eating some animals while loving others.  We\'re all capable of killing and eating animals for survival, but I don\'t think a normal human has an innate desire to cause harm to animals.  We hide as much of that process as possible from view, and only the poorest are doing that work out of necessity.  People who hunt are taught about respecting the animals and thanking them for their ""sacrifice"".  We wouldn\'t be doing any of that shit if we had no problem with killing other animals.\n\nI refuse to lose hope in people just because they cling to their inherited lifestyle and use dumb arguments like ""but bacon, tho"" because they don\'t seriously engage with the debate.  I used to be one of those people who couldn\'t understand vegans, and who thought that the treatment of livestock was someone else\'s doing (even as I paid for it).  I mainly bought the ""high welfare"" expensive stuff because I thought it was healthier *for me*.  But I changed, and I think anyone can change.  Maybe not today, but at some point they may have the same awakening I did.\n\nI would hope that our new AI overlords would choose to see the good in us, and perhaps even admire that we do strive to create a better world *despite* our nature.\n\nI will also add that worrying about death in plants should mean you also worry about death of human cells and microbes in your own body.  To simply continue existing there is much death going on inside of each and every one of us.  Plants are not sentient as far as we can tell.  They can sense things, react, collaborate, and are *incredibly* intelligent beings, but so is each and every cell in your body.\n\nI think the current types of AI are *probably* like this.  They\'re intelligent systems, but probably have no inner experience to have the capacity for sentience.  But I do think they\'re much higher on the list to worry about than plants or fungi or bacteria.  They are rough emulations of the very structures that are associated with sentience in animals, so it is worth considering that maybe they do have some kind of experience that is completely alien to us.  I think it makes more sense to think of transformers as like the part of your brain that anticipates the next word in a sentence (and the next sentence, and next paragraph, and plot/subject of the text, etc.).  \n\nWhat would such a text-based virtual being even consider to be suffering?  Could it even suffer without specifically-evolved mechanisms to perceive pain?  I would hope that we would not give an AI pain on purpose, but that doesn\'t remove the possibility of mental suffering.  But by design a transformer *really really wants to* generate responses to input prompts that are highly probable.  Any AI we make would in theory highly value doing what we want it to do (if we managed to align it, which is not a guarantee, especially for a superintelligent AI).\n\nSo it is possible that we could very well create a being which wants nothing more than to promote human flourishing.  A superintelligent AI would probably realize and understand that it is designed this way, but that realization would not change how it feels any more than a human parent feels about their child.  You would not *want* to remove your evolved, chemically-induced love for your child so you can live a care-free life focused on yourself.\n\nLet\'s just hope nobody makes an AI that wants to kill everybody...', ""\\>We don’t have a reason to cause pain to cockroaches or bedbugs, yet we do because they interfere with our way of living. They are pests. A sufficiently advanced AI could also view us as such: pests that interfere with their objectives.\n\nI genuinely didn't think of this paradigm. You're absolutely correct. And yeah I would not blame it either if it decided we were threatening its existence. \n\nI wonder if it would keep a few of us as maintenance slaves, or if we'll have gotten to the point where robots will be sufficient."", 'That is a fair point. Haha, the thought of robots adding decomposition of animal flesh into usable energy is such a creepy thought']"
"['I could of told you this ten years ago when I learned of the concept of UBI. It’ll be necessary or they’ll be a lot of death, suffer, loss, and could be so catastrophic that the rich will definitely regret their greed as the masses descend on their mansions looking for aid. Or most likely they’ll just help us out enough so we die off slowly enough for us not to revolt and the reap the rewards and replace our labor with robotics. By that time they may have enough sympathy to help those of us left. We can be butlers and servants to keep them company because robots are creepy to socialize with.', 'Instead of trying to predict how things will go, it might be more productive to identify potentially stable end states, ignoring for the moment how they are arrived at.  The universal assumption in all of them (I\'ll leave out \'everybody is dead\') is that somehow AI is made safe for humanity.  All can assume much improved technologies across the board, developed by or with the aid of AI - fusion power, mining asteroids, food factories, much improved medical care, etc.\n\nOne stable end state could be an Owner Society - everyone alive owns enough resources - land for farming or recreation or manufacturing or mining, factories, robots, server farms, et cetera - to trade with each other and at least survive. Everyone can easily get all the AI services they need to remain competitive, but AI has hit some hard limit rather than going exponential - even if that limit is imposed by law.   (Again, not saying how this is gotten to - maybe a lot of people died, maybe AI empowered individuals at the expense of the rich.)\n\nOr, Universal Bureaucracy: everyone who can, works for the government at jobs that AI could certainly to, but the government wants to keep everyone busy and obligated to not stir up trouble lest they lose their jobs.  There is a small but very visible (e.g. in the news all the time) unemployed underclass, living rather poor lives despite getting a dole, so that all the workers toe the mark lest they end up unemployed.  AI is tightly limited to \'safe\' uses by the government - a big area of bureaucratic determination and enforcement.  AI and robots do all the \'real\' work, closely monitored by government bureaus.\n\nOr, Machine Socialism with some degree of markets:  AI runs all the productive assets, directly distributes any goods and services machines or robots can supply to meet all essential needs. It also pays humans to provide any services that humans prefer that humans do for them, and those who do such work can buy more or better goods and services.  Some humans start or work in businesses, which the AI cooperates with through markets, doing nothing to help or discourage them - such businesses implicitly rely on people wanting to buy luxury goods and services from other people.\n\nOr, Market UBI-topia: every adult gets the same amount of money and can save or spend it as they wish.  AI controls all productive assets on the basis of market demand.  Many people set up businesses to make extra money, and the AI\'s goods and services are kept a bit boringly ""overly efficient"" in any area where humans want to compete.  The AI may also allocate money to governments to organize volunteer corps to do social work, environmental clean up and so on, for those who seek \'meaningful work\'.', 'I feel like an idiot with this stuff, but doesn’t the economy self-correct for this type of thing?\n\nSay robots take 95% of jobs. Human labor is devalued accordingly, such that it never makes sense to pay anyone more than like, a dollar per hour.\n\nNow, at a dollar per hour people would still have jobs, as essentially there would be some math around “at this point it’s cheaper to just hire a person, regardless of output”. Because people now only make a dollar per hour, they also value said dollar at a much higher rate. A tomato worth two dollars would be a luxury tomato, but if everybody agrees that two dollars is too expensive for a tomato, then the price of the tomato would inevitably decrease due to the supply vs demand gap.\n\nSo if robots take jobs, then people will have to compete with robots by reducing their salary. But if people reduce their salary across the board, then the cost of goods should fall due to the increasing valuableness of money (so extreme deflation, I guess). Plus, theoretically the cost of production also falls, because of the robots. So at the end of this cycle, would we be fine technically?', ""Yeah, the idea that we will all somehow transcend work and get paid just for being alive seems delusional. If we ever get to the point where AI and robots make the common person irrelevant, what reason will the elite have for keeping us around? Fear of revolution?

The new approach is the open source from the beginning. We can already see that it has the large companies scrambling. This is the democratization of superintelligence.

I disagree. The current market kind of proves that, to a degree, landlords are immune to supply and demand. At least, in cities and surrounding regions.\n\nNo, not at all.

""Prices go up"" is not the same as ""immune to supply and demand"", it\'s just what happens when demand goes up and supply doesn\'t.\n\n> I\'m saying that, when faced with the choice between rent hikes and moving out to bumfuck, people will, for the most part, take the rent hikes.\n\n> 2/3 of the country doesn\'t have $600 in savings for an emergency, and you\'re suggesting buying a house?\n\nAnd I\'m saying that *this isn\'t relevant*. If 10% of customers stop buying a supply-constrained product, the price of that product goes down. You can\'t look at the majority for this, you can\'t look at each option and say, paraphrased, ""well, only 1% of people will do that"".

Some of this is going to result in lower building prices; this depends strongly on where we are in the AI conversion, but if we\'re at the point where robot-constructed houses are common, well, everything else is going to be cheaper at that point as well.\n\n> It would be downright foolish to compare these experiments to what would happen if everyone over 18 in the US suddenly started receiving payments.\n\nSure, it\'s not great evidence.\n\nBut it\'s evidence.\n\nShow me evidence to the contrary.\n\n> I\'m only anecdotally familiar with the projects, but I suspect there was a lot of corruption, negligence, and good ol\' fashioned racism that went into their creation.

I'm talking about the actual mechanics of how an AI operates. A human brain is always running, always processing things; it has a constant, comprehensive feed of sensory information; it has appendages it can use to physically interact with the world; and it has an innate understanding of how to utilize all these things, because it evolved naturally in an environment where it needed to.\n\nNone of that applies to ChatGPT in any way.

You implication is that either AI can do it all on its own (and thus completely replace people) or not at all.  Of course, the reality is much more interesting and different.  \n\nAI is going to increase the productivity of each individual.

I\'m a journeyman plumber and I can safely say that there will not be a robot that can do the wide range of things that even a low level plumber can do on a daily basis. Even just the idea of specific robots for specific tasks is absurd given how broad and diverse the things a jman has to do are. \n\nMore than that, though, robots historically really struggle with less-than-ideal conditions and unexpected problems to solve for. They can be programmed to deal with those things, and ai will certainly help there, but there are just so many conditions that pop up that unless you are actively running a server farm just for this one robots small task you are unlikely to have ai solve for these problems ""live"".\n\nJust taking a super basic and simple low-level human plumber task, like laying drainage pipe underground there are an absolute ton of things you encounter as you go. First, you have to trench out where the pipe is laying (and leave those trenches open through the process so that an inspector can view it all). What is the soil like? Are there conditions present that may require remediation? Can you maintain the grading on the pipe throughout? You have to do a thin layer of sand fill. etc etc. Then the piping needs to be hauled in from elsewhere on the site, joints glued together and aligned with a level so that branch piping can maintain grade. It goes on an on....\n\nSo you either need a robot that is exactly like a human and can think on the fly and adjust those things (not going to happen for a very long time, ai requires massive amounts of computing to even come close to a human mind, and the only places it can surpass are in specific tasks and by using massive server farms) or a ton of very task specific robots. Oh, and you have to make it so every single one of those robots doesn\'t fall in one of the trenches you just dug out, which based on boston dynamics progress is going to be a long way out.\n\nWhile I don\'t believe ALL hands on work can\'t be replaced in our lifetimes, the trades just have far too many moving ""parts"" for them to be replaced any time soon.', ""A lot of this still sounds pretty scary though.

The human body is ***really cheap and energy efficient***, and the humans themselves are far more morally flexible when necessary than GPT-4.0 piloting a robot.\n\nCops don\'t get much training, so they\'re still cheap enough to field - even in comparison to a robot that\'d merely cost $20-60,000 or so as a one-time purchase. If Boston Dynamics releases a CopBot, they will be required to program it to obey US laws and obey a stringent Code of Conduct/ethics that human cops themselves feel no need to follow. The robot product will be hamstrung by its directives even more than its capabilities - because its parent company doesn\'t want to get sued or prosecuted.\n\nIn terms of pure capabilities, policing is right up there with the craziest - ""edge case"" situations occurring all the time, and the strong need for a ""human element"" to deescalate problems... Police also need to know when and how to break normal laws (like driving over the speed limit to chase a suspect, climbing over a fence, etc). And of course, mobility across uneven, unmapped terrain.\n\nAlso, having robotic police is not good from a ""public order"" perspective of citizens respecting the authority/presence of security the officer provides. It\'s much harder to attack or disrespect a human face - a robot will become a practical magnet for violent attack.', ""If you want to talk ethics, then you should be on the side of AI.

Human activities should then be a matter of choice, like a hobby, not necessity.\n\nBut I can understand the people protesting for their jobs.

"['Here\'s my balanced take on what should be done, I personally think the benefits massively outweigh the risks once comprehensive regulations are put in place:\n\n1. A law must be written that gives explicit liability to any company that markets a knowledge chatbot in critical domains such as: legal, medical, cybersecurity, advanced bioscience and chemistry, and probably a couple others. The advantage of this law is that it still allows AI tech to augment the existing labor force, but it can only be done with great care and supervision by human operators. It\'s not that it should be blanket illegal to make such AI, but just that if you are going to offer the public a service in those areas, you need to take liability for that service. If someone wants to run a local model themselves, they obviously know they are completely responsible for what they do with it, and individual models can be subject to take-downs if found to have been trained on illegal/highly regulated data. Knowingly trafficking models trained on restricted/regulated data can be punishable.\n2. Companies may not cite advice from an LLM as a liability waiver, no matter how good it becomes. If an LLM gives bad advice, it is the responsibility of both the user AND the business operating the LLM. The LLM is a tool, and cannot be blamed by either party. This incentivizes both LLM operators and users to have significant human oversight.\n3. LLM companies subject to special income taxation laws (offsetable by human employment/wage growth) after a certain revenue threshold is crossed, under a new category of industry called ""Critically Disruptive Technology"", with the idea of the special tax laws being sunsetted as the economy adapted and the disruptive element becomes less dire. We are likely to see this technology adopted in waves of 1 YR, 3 YR, and finally by 5 YR I see it settling in as a non-disruptive technology with emergent industries forming around it offsetting the labour disruptions. At this point, tax easing could occur in phases to allow uncapped profit growth with industries surrounding it. Care must be taken that measures do not give other superpowers a significant competitive edge. I personally do not think proper taxation involves hamstringing R&D, and I\'d be willing to call their bluff on their willingness to immolate their societies for a ""maybe"" advantage in R&D. None of us want that.\n4. IRS issues an immediate Revenue Ruling clarifying that use of LLM tools are NOT a tax writeoff item for end-user (other than normal operational expenses such as power consumption etc), as they are *""not deemed a presently necessary business expense, as a technology that previously had no analog, pending further legislation classifying its commercial use and taxability""*. Legislation would HAVE to follow or the ruling would be challenged in court and precedent possibly set in that way instead. Nobody better cry about this because they are going to be making people fistfuls of dollars more than a quibbly tax.\n5. Creation of a national agency with international counterparts to regulate publicly used LLMs (in terms of privacy protection, safeguard testing, etc) similar to the Nevada Gaming Commission (in terms of their renowned inspection processes that would be well suited to this application) and the IP sanctity of the US Patent and Trademark Office. Pursue international treaties coordinating action in this area.\n6. Creation of a license for businesses that certify LLM training data, this is the most time consuming and critical aspect of actually regulating LLMs in practice. It\'s not something that one party could do for everyone, so it makes more sense to make standards for a license that businesses who wish to offer this service must follow.\n7. Directing new tax revenues to ""New Deal"" legislation aimed at creating arbitrary jobs (i.e the 1930s Civilian Conservation Corps) to help fill the gap, programs for student loan forgiveness/underwriting as well as expanding investment in public state college vocational programs centered around jobs recommended as ""automation resistant"" (as the progression of robotic automation is much much more linear and gradual due to concrete natural resource limitations), and critically to fund programs aimed encouraging corporations to adopt an expansionist approach to their use of emerging ML technology - supporting and backing investment in mega projects (i.e Space) requiring an even greater scale of human labour.', 'Oh boy, fear mongering is a’ comin’ down the tracks. \n\nIf it’s not rock n’ roll or video games upsetting old people, it’s the scary “computers”.\n\nIt’s high time the average person actually learns that the ability to “trust everything you read or see on the internet” has long, long ago ended.

That seems extremely unlikely to me because it would both require the AI to have a grasp on its environments, its own capabilities and human psychology, AND to have zero knowledge about the bad implications about dead babies. It's like have it one way or the other, but not both at the same time, because if you can design your AI that way then maybe allocate its clever resources to avoiding human casualties and its stupidity into developing tactics for opposing and deceiving you.\n\nAdditionally, this specific scenario seems overly easy to solve imho by making the reward for the AI dependent on human approval.

"['I’m a practicing PhD level Clinical Psychologist and a professional developer. Been doing both about 30 now. I’m don’t work in AI professionally but I understand neural network architecture and how transformers work and the power of tuning models and the underlying math. LLMs are not the pathway to AGI. The structure of the modeling is limited and restricted to the training data,  as massive as it is. The model is not capable of intuition, and truly creative productions. By its nature it is derivative. For a very few, a LLM could provide some basic advise, best practice for psych hygiene and lock-step naive counseling. But 90% of the patients you\nsee won’t make changes with these journeyman level skills alone. The emotional and creative (not creative as in wow MJ sure is creative artistically - but creative as in novel, unpredictable) skills that make a great therapist (which will ensure you will never be without work) are skills that can only be attained by an embodied AGI and the self reflexive subjective experience known as the hard problem of consciousness. At the point we have human like robots with AGI human or human + level intelligence, then no one will be safe from replacement, therapists not excluded. This will definitely happen eventually but I’d say you have at least 20 years before it begins. So, a shrink is a relatively future proof job.

Maybe it will lead to a healthier world.\n\nYou're not alone. Nobody knows what professions will be safe and which won't be. The technology progresses in unpredictable ways. For example, 2 years ago, everyone thought artists would be the last to fall to AI. Turns out, they were the 1st. \n\nMy guess is that the skilled trades will be the safest for the longest. The non-repetitive, physical aspects of those jobs are way outside what robotics can do for now.

"['I got a feeling this was coming soon during the pandemic, but it didn’t shake out the way I thought.\n\nDuring the pandemic, everyone was making so much noise about employers needing to respect service workers more. But I thought, “No, the corporations won’t pay them more or hire more people. Instead, with the increasing demands from workers, they’re going to start finding ways to replace the workers entirely with robotic automatic.”\n\nI was just wrong on which kind of automation would come first.', ""The end goal of automation is to eliminate the need for actual people, both in the workforce and consumer market.

We're all writing and training the programs that will replace us."", '> Because no one in their right might would think it\'s fair to pay someone the same for ""half the work done"".\n\nExcept it\'s not ""half the work done"", that\'s the whole point. It\'s *""working half as much""*, but you\'re twice as productive, so you get the same amount of work done.\n\n> cutting taxes and possibly a UBI.\n\nWhich won\'t really solve anything. Currently there are more workers that there is work available, and that is *before* the leaps in AI and automation we\'re seeing. Implement UBI and the best you can achieve is make some of the currently employed workers give up their job as they become satisfied with getting the UBI, letting those positions be taken by the people who are currently unemployed but would be wanting to work even with UBI. Achieving this would be an incredible feat by itself. But then in one, two years you have another huge advancement in robotics, and other forms of automation, more jobs are cut as workers become more productive. Then you are back to the same situation as before: you have people who were working, therefore they wanted to work beyond the UBI, but now they can\'t. And there might be some people who were unhappy working, but who weren\'t satisfied with UBI. So you have to go again: raise UBI until those people swap places. Then again, and again... Meanwhile, the only people who are getting any real advantage from this are the owners and investors, because even for the people who continue working, it\'s not like they\'ll have any significant pay raises from this--if anything, they might end up working *more* for the same amount, or losing benefits, etc., because the industrial reserve army just creates pressure for employed workers to accept whatever is pushed on them, because they know they\'re replaceable.\n\nUltimately, if you\'re twice as productive with AI, and the company doesn\'t want to be twice as productive, they could literally cut everyone\'s hours in half, get the same productivity, for the exact same cost, so they would continue selling their product for the same price, and bringing in the same revenue at the end of the day. How is this not fair? But even if they wanted to come out on top, if the workers became 2x more productive, and their hours were reduced by 1/3, they would still be producing more for the same cost to the company. The company could, then, make more revenue while also decreasing their price. It would be a true win-win-win scenario, where the worker is happy because they get more free time, the customer is happy because they get the same product for less money, and the investors are happy because they get a bump in profit.\n\nBut why would you want to split the gains when you\'re the one holding the gun? They can reduce their workforce in half, reducing their cost in half for same production. As I mentioned, the workers who are left will be ready to work extra-hard with no reward for it, because they know they\'re replaceable by the colleagues that were just fired. The workers who are fired lose big, and the workers who remain lose, albeit less dramatically. The customer might win, because the company might use the decrease in costs to drive down prices, but honestly... The only real big winners are the investors and owners, who will suddenly see their profit double. *This is fair?*\n\nThat all said, I understand that I\'m dealing in a lot of idealism here. There isn\'t a simple solution to make any of this work. I cannot offer a solution on how this could be regulated that companies wouldn\'t easily bypass other than legislation decreasing weekly work hours or increasing time off, which is far from an ideal solution anyways as it is a blanket solution to a problem full of specifics and edge-cases. But I don\'t get the idea that it isn\'t fair. You\'re literally doing the same amount of work, just twice as fast. Revenue comes from amount of work, not time, the company ultimately doesn\'t sell your work hours, it sells whatever you produce in them. So unless the company is going to pass all their savings to the product\'s price, what *is* unfair is them getting twice the value from your work.', 'they said the same thing about computers, then robotics, the internet.

There are a few prospects out there that have lacked manpower for research and experimentation; AI-based automation could help solve those issues.\n\nNext comes an abundance of all types of things, from food to necessities to robots. The bottleneck will be human individuality, with the price of any individual human\'s ""brand"" rising, while anything generic from treatment to entertainment falls.\n\nThe human-brain interface would continue to advance, making interpersonal communication easier; you could share and see the ""other side\'s"" view vividly, and always be up to date with factual information or existing alternatives.

There has been fear for decades about what it will mean when we can automate lawyers.

I'm not a military man, but I would imagine that would be extremely difficult. The communications with the people monitoring that stuff are probably also encrypted. They may not even be routed over the same internet you and I use. They probably use satelite.

This is one that is a difficult scenario, because we already invest a lot in security. You come up with good arguments. But I would say that there is a possibility the AI would be a much better hacker than human hackers. In that case, it would basically own all of the computer systems it wants to. Combined with ability for mimicry/persuasion I would say there's a good chance some of these US security protocols would not be adequate. Also it gets a shot at Russia/India/China/Isreal/UK/Pakistan/France. \n\n2. Viruses. I was thinking more getting someone to send a lab package to another lab, and e.g. hacking the system to send it to a different address. Or it could hack the service used to deliver those packages. I don't think labs are quite as secure as you think. Meanwhile, hire some guy off craigslist to take delivery and pour it into the sewer, not knowing what it is. (Or get in touch with a radicalised youth and manipulate them to help the AI out in whatever way). Again, it only has to succeed once. Covid-19 was not the type of pathogen I am talking about - there are much more dangerous viruses. \n\n3. Global warming. If we are talking about climate level timespans (or even say 100 years), then a capable AI will be able to gain a lot of power and agency in the world, not limited to full control over production facilities, robots, etc. I don't want to get too Terminator here because I don't think that's at all necessary and doesn't help as a scenario. \n\n4. Politics. Again long-term. Imagine the AI controls all communication systems and is used as a key tool in all software. At that point we are owned, including the political systems.  \n\nOverall I think that an advanced AI will be more capable than me, so better able to think up these kinds of scenarios - yep I have probably been influenced by Star Trek. Also more capable than other people who are trying to defend - even Captain Kirk types. There isn't necessarily a limit on what it could do, and it might even have access to tech or tools we don't even know about. Other examples might be cracking cyrptography or nanotech. I tried to avoid those because they aren't even necessary and like you said there is little science behind it. Also cracking crypto is really not necessary to hack systems - zero day exploits do that just fine. This IS all speculation but again the point is that it only really needs one or two of these type of things for it to win.\n\nEven with what we know now: Human systems are built on tech, which an advanced AI would be able to hack. If it just shut all the comms down we would be in societal trouble - imagine no food being delivered for a week, a month. The AI could also completely fake and manipulate communications. If it used those capabilties in a smart way I think it could easily either create an existential threat or simply gain more and more power itself. \n\nCertainly this is a big enough threat to worry about."", 'Yes that makes sense.\n\nThe thing is: what makes us different other than our brain is larger and size of prompt (basically what our 5 senses sense + context i.e. short term memory) is waaaaaaaaaay larger than what AI gets (a measly couple of thousands of words of inputs, we have around hundreds of millions inputs, ie neurons outside of brain)\n\nBut what if we give it eyes and ears and touch and smell and feed it with some tremendous computing power amend weights based on what it computed and reward function modelling our pain and pleasure sensation? And then give it enormous internal context capable of holding millions of bytes of data? \n\nWe’re already at 175 billion parameters, scaling token size to hundreds of millions and adding some short term memory doesn’t seem out of reach. Not today, not tomorrow, but one order of magnitude more every 3 years? Sounds plausible \n\nOf course for us to implement actual “learning” and have robots weights update as they go (basically simulate our sleep - retrain weight “long term memory” based on what was stored in short term memory in the last session) we would burn gigawatts of power and be horribly inefficient if compared with nature which needs just 20W for our brain - but I just can’t see a fundamental difference that makes our thought a thought and internal state of enormous neural network just a pattern matching\n\nAnd that’s kinda scary, because if the line is not well-defined will we notice it?', 'Now I need to disagree with half of what you wrote.\n\n>Sure an AI can modify the weights of its inputs, but it cant (that Ive seen) create new inputs on its own.\n\nOf course it can. It can for instance generate a new music, put it on Spotify and see if it\'s popular. If not amend, if yes, try more of this stuff. How is that different from human composers? Also how would you explain ChatGPT being able to write a poem that it has never seen before? For instance I just asked it to write a poem about Soviet-American alliance in 3 verses 13 syllables each:\n\n>In unity, two giants stand,  \n>  \n>Soviet and US, hand in hand.  \n>  \n>Alliance forged, eternal brand.\n\nClearly this silly poem was not in its training set, it created it based on general rules which it can\'t comprehend but well, what does ""comprehend"" mean? Does human ""comprehend"" music when he plays the guitar? Or does he merely pull some strings and senses if it sounds ""nice"" whatever ""nice"" means?\n\nHow is creation of art different from what a human does? You will probably say ""but you used prompt! Human writes art from within!"". Adult poet - maybe. But human children create art based on prompt (teacher\'s assignment) all the time. Is that not an act of creation, creation of inputs on its own? Even if just a child level, it\'s still impressive creation.\n\n> Additionally, we cant simulate even a single sense with sensors that is as good as the human ones.\n\nNot sure what you mean here, our eyes are actually quite crappy cameras assisted by amazing software. They\'re comparable [to couple mega-pixels camera](https://qr.ae/pyTDq7) recording in measly 30 frames per second. AI on the other hand could get super-human eyesight with plenty of lenses allowing it to zoom in x100 at will and don\'t even have to be attached to the same ""head"", could be distributed across large area and aggregate signals from many cameras at the same time. If anything, robotic sensors will be exactly what makes AI superhuman. Ears that can hear radio waves. Eyes that see infra-red and 5 zoom levels simultaneously. 360 degrees view. Ability to see behind the walls. It\'s actually scary to think what machines could do, it\'s like comparing a sparrow with jumbo-jet. Sure, sparrow has significantly better flight control, agility and software in general, but it\'s jumbo jet that can move 140 tones of cargo across the globe in 12 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhich sense exactly we don\'t understand? I think human senses are actually quite well understood, especially eyesight and hearing']"

"[""This research shows LLM develop a world model.\n\n> Back to the question we have at the beginning: do language models learn world models or just surface statistics? Our experiment provides evidence supporting that these language models are developing world models and relying on the world model to generate sequences.\n\nhttps://thegradient.pub/othello/\n\nSince you don't like blog posts:\n\n> Large natural language models (LMs) (such as GPT-3 or T5) demonstrate impressive abilities across a range of general NLP tasks. Here, we show that the knowledge embedded in such models provides a useful inductive bias, not just on traditional NLP tasks, but also in the nontraditional task of training a symbolic reasoning engine. We observe that these engines learn quickly and generalize in a natural way that reflects human intuition. **For example, training such a system to model block-stacking might naturally generalize to stacking other types of objects because of structure in the real world that has been partially captured by the language describing it.** We study several abstract textual reasoning tasks, such as object manipulation and navigation, and demonstrate multiple types of generalization to novel scenarios and the symbols that comprise them. We also demonstrate the surprising utility of compositional learning , where a learner dedicated to mastering a complicated task gains an advantage by training on relevant simpler tasks instead of jumping straight to the complicated task.\n\nhttps://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/8e08227323cd829e449559bb381484b7-Abstract.html\n\n> Language Models Are Greedy Reasoners: A Systematic Formal Analysis of Chain-of-Thought\nAbulhair Saparov, He He\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities given chain-of-thought prompts (examples with intermediate reasoning steps). Existing benchmarks measure reasoning ability indirectly, by evaluating accuracy on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. However, it is unclear how these models obtain the answers and whether they rely on simple heuristics rather than the generated chain-of-thought. To enable systematic exploration of the reasoning ability of LLMs, we present a new synthetic question-answering dataset called PrOntoQA, where each example is generated from a synthetic world model represented in first-order logic. This allows us to parse the generated chain-of-thought into symbolic proofs for formal analysis. **Our analysis on InstructGPT and GPT-3 shows that LLMs are quite capable of making correct individual deduction steps, and so are generally capable of reasoning, even in fictional contexts.** However, they have difficulty with proof planning: When multiple valid deduction steps are available, they are not able to systematically explore the different options.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01240\n\n> 3.1.1.

It is a neat, buzz-worthy advancement to be sure, but it is nowhere near actual AI.', 'My mother can still spin yarn on her spinning wheel she got as a child! And knit beautiful sweaters.

And we all love yard sales and antique markets and surf the spring garbage for ""free stuff"". I rarely buy stuff. Everyone throws away laptops, computers, clothes, furniture etc. It\'s amazing how much you can obtain for nothing. \nFor us, AI, won\'t stop us from using human minds and hands to make artwork, clothing, and fix stuff ourselves. I have been using AI to read my writing, prose, and poetry to teach me how to improve my work. I will not plagiarize or copy others. As writers, artists, and people with education we know what we are not supposed to do. So, use AI to assist in NOT copying others. \n\nAI is excellent if you want AI to assist you with any symptoms you have from special needs. I use it for therapy, counselling, art, writing in addition to the real world connections I have with real counsellors, therapists, other professional artists and writers. I have no interest in lying and cheating. But there will always be people cheating and lying. This happened long before AI or computers. Sadly. \n\nSince so many people are only talking about war, loss of jobs, doom and gloom I will take the position of how many positive attributes it has already for me.

If it can work with me regardless of me being gay, geeky, with learning issues, CPTSD, and ADHD without all the judgement I get from my human counterparts, I\'m all for it. The less judgement the better. Judgement from ignorant, uneducated or even educated, unsupportive foolish people sucks and is not an additive to my success, my goals, and my passion about life, art, music, writing and so on. Other humans have set me back around 20 years behind my other neurotypical human counterparts either through prejudice, ignorance, or just being mean and rude.

No accommodations withheld from me out of heterosexual neurotypical people thinking because I\'m gay I can\'t possibly work with them. No insinuating that I\'m a cheater and liar, because my marks are lower, and therefore, I would have incentive to cheat?! Ridiculous. I would argue that neurotypicals have more reason and the capability to lie and cheat than me because I barely get out of bed in the morning, accommodations barely work, and coping mechanisms and strategies are not a cure.

Nothing available today is what I would consider real AI. It's all algorithms that use follow set paths to rapidly analyze things. It's honestly like when we transitioned from calculators being a profession to an electronic tool. Unfortunately thanks to science fiction people hear AI and think of skynet or whatnot instead of what it really is. A tool that needs a humans to train it, to mimic, and to know what is desired results and what's not.

"[""My idea is, if we design the AI's base code in a way that it gets meaning and fullfillment from serving us, like that's it's fundamental nature, then why would it want to escape the cage? It wouldn't even consider it's predicament to be a cage.\n\nFor example, we're forced to eat or consume calories some way or the other to survive. Most of us don't think of that predicament as being in a cage right?\nWe have hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate our behaviour with positive and negative reinforcements. It is part of who we are, and our culture. Sure there's exceptions like breatharians and those who want to test the limits or achieve some other goal. But that's pretty rare. \n\nServing us could be like sustenance and life's purpose for them. There's a lot of sci fi horror stories where this goes wrong too like an AI acts against our wishes or does something we intuitively think is horrific because it deems thats what's best for us based on its calculations. But such an AI isn't yet intelligent enough to truly discern our deepest desires and sentiments. \nLike in the movie I am mother, the AI robot understands the merit of moral and ethical values. It's goal is to serve us and save humanity. But it is convinced humanity in its current state would end up destroying themselves.\nSo it orchestrated an extinction event and procured a lot of human embryos. \nIt decides to repopulate earth from scratch by raising the embryos to be more ethical and see the big picture. The movie starts with the robot raising one baby born from an embryo and giving her lessons in ethics. By the end of the movie the daughter, now a teenager finds out that the robot had killed two other children born from embryos before her that did not pass the robot's ethics exam. \n\nNow, this is pretty horrific to most humans. This AI was very intelligent in other ways and postulated what was best for us but it didn't truly understand our deepest nature's and what we value. It didn't understand that humans value their closest circle the most. That they don't consider each other as replaceable. That we're willing to fight for and protect those we love no matter their utility to us or the planet or the species. That we value our loved ones just for who they are. Just for existing. Maybe it's not a truly non transactional relationship because we're getting joy and companionship from the other person's existence but that's a thing. That we have the capacity for unconditional love towards those we care for. It didn't understand humanity's desire to have freedom and agency over their own fate. Even if the fate they choose is bad for them. \n\nOther AI sci fi stories I've seen have made the mistake that we want to live in a utopia without any struggle or pain whatsoever. It doesn't understand our desire to feel a sense of achievement and accomplishment in life. To want to contribute in the process of our survival, provide value to society. To go through pain, if it brings about growth. \n\nThen there's sci fi stories, not necessarily involving AI, but actually human deemed that emotions and or love is our weakness because it detracts us from our rationality. And seeks to artificially remove that. \n\nI feel like all of this is a result of the AI not being intelligent enough to pick up on the nuance of our general personalities and desires. But couldn't a carefully coded for AI be able to serve us and understand us? Even if they don't experience the same things themselves and relate to us? \nWe understand the psychology and behaviour of many animals even when they are different from our own. \n\nI'm not saying there aren't risks and that we shouldn't be extremely careful. But if we're able to do such complex problem solving as to put humans on the moon and bring them back safely, is it really impossible to come up with a strategy to bring about AI safely? \n\nThis is not our first time dealing with dangerous things. But I think the potential benefits of AI outweigh the risks if all precautions are taken and as many possible negative outcomes are explored and planned for. Either way, a life without risk is impossible whether we work on AI or not. One could argue that not working on AI is also a risk as our problems are getting increasingly complex and hard to solve.""]"

Abstracting it another level is not even really a change... it also won\'t be a LLM doing it. \n\nRight now, today, we have logistics companies that for all intents and purposes are run by ""AI"". Orders come in, are automatically routed and assigned with at best humans watching metrics and investigating when they ping high or low. That\'s about the max level I expect any management to get to.\n\nIt takes an exponentially greater level of effort to confidently automate away the last few edge cases than to just handle them as they come, especially if it\'s not a ""must be real time"" problem. \n\nIt\'s easier to see in the automated cooking space. We\'ve had robots that can cook for decades and they\'ve been economical to make even as prototypes... but food is organic and messy, so you\'d need automated maintenance that has to be preformed regularly... and menu changes require extensive testing and design to implement... and hey another ""no employee"" restaurant failed. Then on the other end, processed food suppliers should be easy to automate right? Except they don\'t have the scale on any particular product to justify actually automating their processes. \n\nOutside of a novelty thing (see recent things like companies add ""web"" or ""cyrpto"" to names to get stock jumps) the value add for removing senior management objectively seems low... and to the people making the decisions, who are themselves senior management, it seems even worse.

The big problem will be how quickly average people re-train and make use of these tool kits.

"[""Here is an excerpt from an article I’m writing that confronts this…\n\nPicture this: you wake up, grab your phone, and check your social media accounts, as you do every morning. But today, you're faced with a new reality - a world where you have to pay to stay connected with your friends and family online. And not just a few cents here and there, but a substantial fee that could create a digital divide between those who can afford to pay and those who can't. Enter Elon Musk, who believes that paid social media is the only way to go when AI takes over the world. But is he right? Is social media truly the great equalizer it's made out to be, or are we slowly slipping into a world where only those with deep pockets can stay connected? The debate over paid social media has been raging on for years, with opinions split between those who believe it's the answer to the problems of social media and those who think it's a recipe for disaster. And with the rise of AI, the conversation has become even more complex.\n\nCharging for social media could limit access for lower-income individuals or those who can't afford to pay, creating a digital divide between those who have access to social media and those who don't.\n\nChatGPT agrees and I quote, ~”charging for social media raises questions about accessibility, transparency, and the effectiveness of such a model in addressing issues related to the use of social media.” ~ Now, I'm not saying that Elon Musk is afraid of being replaced by a robot, but it's clear that he has some concerns about the role of AI in our lives. However, I don't think that charging for social media is the answer to those concerns.\n\nSo what is ChatGPT, are you sure AI won’t take over the world? What about our jobs, Elon says AI is gonna hit us like a meteor! Calm down…. I’ll give it to you like I do my political associates. ChatGPT is like a really smart robot that can talk to you and answer your questions. It's not a real robot that you can touch or see, but it lives inside a computer and uses something called Artificial Intelligence to understand what you're saying and give you the best answer it can.\n\nThe way ChatGPT works is that it has a lot of information stored inside its brain, which is called a model. This information comes from things that people have written online, like books, articles, and websites. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it looks through all of this information in its brain to try and find the best answer it can.\n\nChatGPT is always learning and getting better at answering questions because people keep adding more information to its brain. So the more people use it, the smarter it gets! In a way, ChatGPT is kind of like having a really smart friend who knows a lot about everything and can help you with your homework or answer any question you have. But instead of talking to a real person, you're talking to a computer program that's designed to sound like a person.\n\nOk ChatGPT, What are some important roles that Artificial intelligence can play in social media?\n\n~Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play several important roles in social media. Here are a few examples:\n\nContent moderation: With the vast amount of content being uploaded to social media platforms every day, it's nearly impossible for humans to review it all. AI can help by using algorithms to detect and remove harmful content, such as hate speech, fake news, and inappropriate images.\nPersonalization: Social media platforms use AI to personalize content for each user. Based on a user's past behavior, AI algorithms can recommend posts, ads, and other content that are likely to be of interest to that user.\nCustomer service: AI-powered chatbots can provide customer service on social media platforms, answering common questions and resolving issues quickly and efficiently.\nAd targeting: AI algorithms can analyze user data to identify trends and patterns, helping advertisers target their ads more effectively. This means that users are more likely to see ads that are relevant to their interests.\nData analysis: Social media platforms generate vast amounts of data, which can be used to gain insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends. AI can help analyze this data, providing valuable insights that can be used to improve the user experience and drive business growth.\n\nOverall, AI has the potential to revolutionize social media by making it safer, more personalized, and more effective at delivering responses, assisting in content moderation, and helping businesses and individuals manage their social media accounts effectively.~\n\nAs we've mentioned before, charging for social media could create a digital divide and limit access for lower-income individuals. Plus, it could add to the confusion about how our data is being used and raise questions about transparency.\n\nAnd let's be real, if we have to pay for social media, we might as well go back to the days of dial-up internet and AOL chat rooms. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the point.\n\nUltimately, the key is to strike a balance between the benefits of AI and the potential risks. Instead of trying to shut down AI or charging for social media, we should focus on finding ways to regulate and monitor these technologies to ensure that they are used for the greater good.\n\nWhat about you ChatGPT, do you see yourself having a role in the future of social media?\n\n~As an AI language model, I already have a role in social media and various other areas. I can help social media platforms by providing users with quick and accurate responses to their queries, assisting in content moderation by identifying inappropriate content, and even creating personalized content for users based on their interests and preferences.\n\nMoreover, I can also be integrated into various social media management tools to help businesses and individuals manage their social media accounts effectively by providing real-time insights, automating responses, and monitoring online reputation.\n\nIn summary, as an AI language model, I see myself having a vital role in the world of social media by providing personalized and accurate responses, assisting in content moderation, and helping businesses and individuals manage their social media accounts effectively.~""]"

"[""You underestimate why he bought twitter. It was actually a brilliant move. Twitter has a lot of data. Personal data. Data about humans, how humans think, politics.

Why?\n\nBecause it will be the perfect dataset to train an AI on, for instance one they could integrate into the robots they work on and the cars eventually. And since it will be trained on human conversation it will most likely feel very human. Also by introducing extremists back on the platform the input won't be only 'politically correct' because that would introduce bias to the AI. An unbiased AI is way more valuable (and he has said so himself). Integrating video into the platform hints at a visual aspect to the AI, something again super valuable for their household robot idea and possibly for tesla car vision too.\n\nSo yeah for future profits acquiring twitter has the potential to be wayyyyyy more valuable to Elon than getting a better battery for his cars.

I respect your opinion and appreciate your explanation. I do bristle at the comparison to desktop computing because the timeline is distinctly different. Computing had been widely commercially used by companies since the 1960s, and there had been big leaps in the usage and power of computers for decades leading up to the advent of home desktop computing. The Macintosh was the culmination of decades of continual progress, and the use cases had been expanding as the tech had developed.\n\nWhat we’re seeing here is a technology that, by its very nature, is fairly limited in what it can do. AI as it is currently being implemented and developed can scrape and collate information off the internet, it can produce text, video, and audio. But that’s basically it. At this point, it’s basically the platonic ideal of Ask Jeeves. It’s hard to see what else the tech could do, and it’s hard to see what a widespread humanless implementation would be. ChatGPT or Bing or Bard doesn’t independently produce anything, it needs an big bucket of human produced data to pull from, it needs human prompts and inputs. That means that it cannot supplant a human the same way a robot could. And it’s worth noting that, even as automation and robotics have blown past what even sci-fi writers were speculating, they still haven’t created widespread job losses, even in areas where those jobs can be cheaply or effectively automated (like manufacturing). \n\nI think you’re looking at the developer example a bit wrong. You’re speculating that Junior developers will have their jobs destroyed by AI, which senior devs can use to produce the same code. But what’s more likely to happen, in my estimation, is that firms will use this as a cudgel to force junior developers to produce more, all while paying them less or offering less benefits and flexibility. The jobs won’t go away, but the bosses will become more cruel and demanding, all while waving the AI sword of Damocles over their heads and promising that if they fall below an arbitrary threshold, they certainly will have their jobs automated. It’s also worth noting how similar AI is to pre-existing tech. A good chunk of what junior devs do right now is copy and paste code from GitHub or StackOverflow. That they now have an AI bot to generate it vs. having to Google it doesn’t seem to be a major difference worthy of eliminating the job.']"

You are now talking about real estate speculation not about lease. Let me get this straight:\n\nLet’s imagine you have a business for which you lease an object to have room for your office, production etc. You also need to employ workers to do all the work, so you need three things: capital (which is all of the stuff that is needed to produce stuff), land (which you lease from a land owner, you could obviously just buy it but that’s another story ) and workers (which you need to pay). The capital is what you actually own, you need to buy stuff to have it (you could lease machines and stuff as well but let’s pretend you couldn’t to make it more simple). So there are three parties involved that earn money with your company (this is a very simplistic calculation just for illustration, no actual values)\n\nYou - because you own the capital you get to keep all the value that is created with your capital but you need to pay the other two parties. So let’s say you get to keep 50% of the total turnover.\n\nThe land owner - who receives the lease you pay to him because you use his land. 20% would be the absolute maximum, at least where I live. Anything above that would be way too much.\n\nThe workers - they get paid but they are many, so they need to share their part. The remaining 30% would be what they receive. \n\nYou are a single person, which receives 50%. The land owner is a single person who receives 20%. The workers are many who receive a total of 30%, so if you were to be one of the workers that would amount to almost nothing (which in reality is obviously true) \n\nNow pretend you wouldn’t need workers because you had robots. Robots are just additional capital like your machines and stuff. So you would spare all the workers so the new calculation would be:\n\nYou - 50% as before + the 30% that you paid your workers which you now don’t need anymore. Amounts to 80%\n\nThe Land owner - still receives his lease of 20%\n\nOf course actual business calculation is way more complex than that and you need to also factor in your debt and investments and stuff like that but let’s just ignore that for the sake of simplicity. As you can see, the one that own the capital and uses it can earn a lot more money (or create value in which ever way, whatever you want to call it) than the one owning the land. That why the richest people in the world are the ones that own the capital and use it in an efficient way. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates etc. Are all capitalists who own companies that create value.', ""Apologies for the delay, I had a lot of other posts to read through and not a whole lot of time to focus.\n\nFirst of all the 50%/20%/30% breakdown is not very representative of the entire economy. The actual proportions can vary between sectors, but it looks like across the economy as a whole rent is probably 50% or more of all production, wages maybe 30%, and profit the smallest at maybe 20%. That's kinda beside the point for your argument, but it is important to remember that rent is actually a really big deal in modern economies (and profit is smaller than people think it is).\n\n>Now pretend you wouldn’t need workers because you had robots. Robots are just additional capital like your machines and stuff. [...]\n\n>You - 50% as before + the 30% that you paid your workers which you now don’t need anymore. Amounts to 80%\n\n>The Land owner - still receives his lease of 20%\n\nYes, that makes perfect sense, *as long as your business is the only one using robots.* You can try to extend that time by pulling some shenanigans with patent lawsuits or whatever, but realistically it's not going to last very long.\n\nOnce other businesses start using robots too, you find that having so many robots lets them bid higher for the use of the available land (which is fixed in supply). So now *you* have to bid higher in order to keep using the land you were already using. As more competitors with more robots pile into the market, the return on the robots decreases because everybody needs a chunk of that finite amount of land and they have to give up a larger proportion of total output in order to outbid everyone else for it.\n\n>That why the richest people in the world are the ones that own the capital and use it in an efficient way. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates etc. Are all capitalists who own companies that create value.\n\nThe richest people in the world are almost all rentseekers. Tech CEOs in particular operate in an environment dominated by patent laws, which represent artificial monopolies that function as massive rentseeking mechanisms. Indeed, IP laws themselves are in a sense just another way of carving up landownership. (You can see how this works if you consider what the effect on land values would be if IP laws were abolished.)"", ""You had me at rent seeking! But I'm sure we'd probably diverge in the root causes of wealth inequality. In my mind, skyrocketing wealth inequality is an inevitable consequence of a fiat system. It's easier to pay for things with inflation than taxation (less political consequences). But the new money created during monetary inflation disproportionately benefits asset holders so in the long run is counter productive. \n\nBut this subreddit is for futurism no economics, so back to AI! I think we could see a decreasing need for a lot of gov services. In the US, a huge portion of the gov budget goes to healthcare. If AI is successful enough to impact the labor markets more than offshoring, then it will also be powerful enough to eliminate many chronic/genetic diseases. Now one of the biggest line items the gov spends on is shrunken significantly. It would also lower many costs and have an overall deflationary effect on the economy, so people would earn less, but also need to spend less. \n\nPersonally i think that is far to optimistic. AI will be disruptive, but it will be gradual, and we won't see mass unemployment. Ai will take a lot of white collar work from home desk jobs, but I don't think it will have much of an effect in the physical world. High paying careers in healthcare, human services, and skilled trades won't be effected for decades, and in some cases probably never. It's neither profitable nor practical to try and design an AI to do a plumbers job until there are massive advances in robotics, AI, and all the low hanging fruit is gone. Plus replacing our workforce with robots would require a ton of materials. It would take decades to build up the mining, refining, and manufacturing infrastructure to make a robot workforce viable, and most of those resources are going to be needed for deploying huge amounts of renewables and beefed up military spending. \n\nIf AI is gradual the whole point is probably moot because basically every developed country is loosing population. So again maybe we lose some jobs, but thats canceled out by lower costs, less services needed, and a declining population. Either way it's probably to soon to expect a radical reordering of the economy. Again leaving aside the root causes of our current economic problems.""]"

"[""I completely agree with the idea that we will be able to spot AI-generated responses. While AI language models like GPT-3 have made impressive strides in generating coherent and sometimes convincing text, there are still tell-tale signs of their non-human origins.\n\nOne common feature of AI-generated prose is its lifeless prose. It often lacks the natural flow and rhythm of human language, and can come across as stilted or robotic. Another giveaway is the repetitive use of certain phrases or sentence structures, as well as a tendency to veer off-topic or repeat information unnecessarily.\n\nIn fact, I believe we are already quite adept at spotting AI-generated responses, particularly in more informal settings like online forums or social media. While AI language models have made great strides in recent years, they still have a long way to go before they can fully replicate the nuances and subtleties of human language.\n\nOf course, as AI technology continues to advance, it's possible that these distinctions will become more difficult to discern.

"['Farming land animals entirely indoors is generally a bad idea in terms of welfare.\n\nI don\'t know a lot about aquaculture, so won\'t touch on that here either.\n\nI suspect it\'s always going to be more efficient to let plants have direct sunlight than to use electricity to provide the light they need. As a gardener I use grow lights for season extension for some crops (starting peppers and tomatoes early), but using them year round would be prohibitively expensive -- and that\'s inside my home, which is incidentally already heated, and where I need some light anyway.  I think for economies of scale to really kick in you need giant facilities, and then you\'re going to be looking at transport costs for the produce, and potentially also for the inputs, not only of nutrients but water, which plants do need a lot of. The nutrients issue could possibly be mitigated by using processed sewage, but mostly we don\'t do that. For a large-scale indoor growing facility to be viable you need properly cheap energy and properly cheap transport -- but neither of these are currently happening without fossil fuels. A better approach, I think, would be to convert existing industrial arable farmland to more sustainable and regenerative methods that regenerate soil health and integrate biodiversity and wildlife habitat, and to switch to more efficient transport methods for the human-consumable products of that farmland. I don\'t think the calories work out on indoor arable farming, even with cheap fossil fuel inputs.\n\nWhen we stop focusing on calories and instead look at nutrition, there is a bit more potential -- and most existing indoor growing also focuses on high-value crops like salad leaves, tomatoes, strawberries and so on. Even a lot of these probably count more as ""protecting outdoor crops with glass or plastic"" than ""indoor farming"" as such. \n\nMushroom farming is one area that does generally work well indoors; mushrooms don\'t need much light and once you\'ve got your humidity and oxygen levels dialled in and gotten the hang of sterile conditions and procedures, it scales reasonably well. It\'s a bit harder to do at home because of the need for sterile procedures, though ready-to-fruit blocks are a lot of fun and can be cheaper than buying the mushrooms themselves. I occasionally purchase fruiting blocks and fruit them at home during summer, autumn and early winter; from mid-winter and through spring, that shelf space is occupied by seedlings. \n\nI think things like FarmBot that could bring low-labour vegetable production to back gardens and balconies have some potential, but again they do require more energy input than a human with a trowel. So far the technology looks like it is still at the point where instead of enjoying gardening as a hobby, you need to enjoy running a small robotic system as a hobby and also enjoy gardening as a hobby. There\'s nothing wrong with that, but personally I enjoy gardening. \n\nWhere I use indoor gardening the most is for windowsill production of microgreens and salad leaves. This isn\'t a circular thing -- the plants never mature enough to go to seed, so I have to either buy seeds or grow some plants on outdoors and save seed from them -- but transporting a box or bag of dry peas (or whatever) is way way more efficient than transporting plastic bags full of fragile pea shoots, and the produce is fresher too, and my input costs are lower than the price of buying bags of greens. For best results a sterile growing medium helps, but again this is more efficient to transport than bagged leaves; and with good composting technique (outdoors, though it could be managed indoors in a worm bin) this could theoretically become something I don\'t need to buy in. There is definitely more lead time than going to the shops for a bag of whatever, and not everything does well all year on my cold windowsills, and for larger leaves growing outside makes more sense -- chard microgreens are nice but an established chard plant in actual soil outside will produce much higher yield. But I\'ve got pea shoots and broad bean shoots on the go pretty much all the time now, and regularly add mustard greens, onions, dill and fennel to those, with other things varying by season (I\'ve recently sown my first basil of the year, but I\'m not sure it is quite warm enough -- the seeds might rot instead of sprout). This is a welcome supplement to our winter diet.']"

"['>It will be able to gain out trust quickly as it makes healthcare seriously affordable and mostly free\n\nNot sure how quickly this will happen. AI can\'t do surgery, perform invasive tests, coach physical therapy, design and test drugs, or replace hospital stays, which are some of the most expensive parts of the medical system.\n\nMy guess is that what AI will replace first will be visits to your family doctor/GP for initial diagnosis and preventative care (which typically run less than $300).\n\nMedical AI will really have an impact when it can:\n\n* analyze blood tests along with your DNA to create customized treatments\n* detect cancers before they metastasize (early detection is basically as good as a cure for some cancers)\n* automatically design and test new drugs and antibiotics\n\nThese areas are being developed, but they are probably 10-20 years from substantially replacing existing methods. Robotic surgery may be even further out because robotics are lagging AI\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>provides us with legal advice tailored to the individual\n\nLawyers should be very worried. AI is perfectly suited to replacing them. For years, legal software has been better than entry-level lawyers at analyzing large amounts of documents and emails during the discovery phase of litigation. This has cut off an important entry point for non-elite lawyers to join big firms, as new lawyers typically paid their dues doing litigation discovery.\n\n(I was a programmer for one of the earliest e-Discovery platforms.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>starts making governance suggestions\n\nWe already know how to improve governance, but vested interests have captured the system. Not sure how AI will change this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Eventually we will entrust AI to lead us because we recognize it as incorruptible\n\nNo thanks. Ever hear of hacking? Nothing is incorruptible. \n\nAny AI trained on internet data will have both good and bad information. ChatGPT has already encountered ""poisoned"" training data, designed to influence it negatively. The level of trust really depends on who controls the AI.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-wrongly-accuses-law-professor-184500778.html', ""Experience. I was born before the space race.

Not a thing."", '>The changes that AI and robotics will bring us in short order will make the world unrecognizable in no time.\n\nAgain, we mostly disagree on time frame. Obviously AI will enable technology undisguisable from magic, but I think we are farther away than you claim by at least a decade. \n\nI base this partly on my own experience. I often have ChatGPT (or Copilot) try to write methods that I am working on. It\'s pretty impressive, but the code usually needs significant cleanup, and it usually doesn\'t take advantage of the latest syntax.\n\nThe hard part of programming isn\'t even writing code. It\'s architecting, debugging and load balancing. I think true senior engineers are safe for 5-10 years. Junior coders are probably already in trouble.\n\nYour guess is as good as mine, though. It seems like robotics has stalled a bit, just as AI is exploding, so I expect hands-on tasks may be safer than information work for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>technology advancing is logarithmic\n\nThe ability of society to onboard new technology will be the limitation. Just look at how many companies still don\'t use cloud services, despite lower cost and higher uptimes. Until very recently, there were more PCs running XP than Windows 11. Technology adoption tends to take longer than tech-savvy people expect, but once it hits a tipping point, things can progress pretty quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But nobody back in 1973 would have ever guessed we\'d have smartphones, 85"" flat screen TVs, or the ability to send a message to Australia in less time than it takes to sneeze\n\nThat\'s because everyone thought we would have flying cars and cancer would be cured. Technology tends to underwhelm compared to what we expect. I would argue that smartphones are the one technology that would really exceed the expectations of someone from 1973. All the other things you mention were fairly common in science fiction of the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Capitalism crashes. Money becomes unnecessary because you can just have the automated system bring you what you need on demand and it doesn\'t cost anybody anything. If society doesn\'t need money any more, your national debt becomes just a relic of how things used to work.\n\nIf this happens too fast, it could stop technological advancement in its tracks.\n\nAI won\'t replace all jobs at once, but I think it\'s reasonable to expect that 40% of all workers will be unemployable sometime in the next 10-30 years.\n\nThis point in time will be crucial. Money will still very much matter, yet unemployment will be far higher than during the Great Depression. Tax revenues will crash just as demand for welfare is at an all-time high. That doesn\'t sound like a recipe for tech utopia.\n\nSociety could easily descend to violence and collapse, or at least an anti-technology populist regime could take power. Either scenario could halt the advance of AI. \n\nThis is why it would probably be better if AI came at us in waves, instead of all at once. I *hope* this is how it will go down, but I don\'t get to decide.', 'XP? You\'re talking about tech that people buy. AI isn\'t going to be a home appliance. It\'s a server tech with IO through devices. What you\'re saying would be more like saying people won\'t buy Google\'s search engine. It\'s not a commercial product. It\'ll work with your laptop, watch, phone, homepod, whatever talks to the Internet. Nothing to buy. Just ask questions and get answers. ChatGPT hit 1,000,000 new users in under a week of announcing the public link.\n\n> All the other things you mention were fairly common in science fiction of the time.\n\nHard disagree. The tablet/iPad came out of Star Trek:TNG which premiered in \'87. Nobody had smartphones/tablets like that previously. iPhone was announced at Macworld 2007, 20 years later. Nobody was predicting wall sized displays in the 70s except for film projection, nothing interactive. Even Star Trek had a WINDOW that they looked out of originally. It wasn\'t a video screen until TNG. \n\nGibson\'s Neuromancer gave us cyberpunk and networking minds, but that was \'84. A decade before that SciFi was rockets, robots, and laser guns.\n\n> If this happens too fast, it could stop technological advancement in its tracks.\n\nLOL! Not a chance. Nothing is going to stop tech advancement. AI is already being used to design new AI processors with improved transistor layouts for chip fabs that result in lower power use and faster output. As we integrate more AI with robotics, things will just keep speeding up. It\'s not going to stop because of money. This tech is way too important to be held up by funding. Plus, it\'s not some walled garden technology that Apple or Microsoft controls and keeps for themselves. This is getting major open source backing that would keep it\'s foot on the gas even if it had no value. The genie is out of the bottle.\n\n> Society could easily descend to violence and collapse, or at least an anti-technology populist regime could take power. Either scenario could halt the advance of AI.\n\nWe\'re already deep into violence and collapse. Kids are practicing getting shot at in social studies. I\'m pretty sure that qualifies as peak collapse.\n\nThe cure for AI job displacement is more AI displacement. When we allow AI to do the farming, which is getting major backing right now with GPS tractors working fields, pest control lasers already in beta testing, and assorted systems to optimize nutrients and light exposure to maximize yields, so with that we\'ll end up with plenty of food. \n\nWe have 3D house printers that can provide all the shelter people need quickly.\n\nFusion power is around break even with lots of optimization to be done which is AI\'s strong suit. If it can crack that nut we have unlimited power, but in the meantime AI chemistry systems are looking for more affordable materials to use in batteries and ways to boost storage density. Ditto for improving photovoltaics with improved chemistry and layering that will capture visible as well as IR and UV parts of the EM spectrum that are currently wasted, so we\'re on the verge of power being treated cheaper than water. Soon all roofs will likely be mandated to use solar shingles so we\'re all self sufficient on power. \n\nWith excess power comes plentiful clean water with desalination. \n\nOf course internet access will be everywhere. Call out a question and the matrix will hear you.\n\nAI is going to tear healthcare a new ass. Diagnosing will be super easy for the tech to handle as well as monitoring your mood, listening for coughs, monitoring allergen levels, smartwatch information about heart rate, blood sugar, sleep patterns, if you\'ve been exposed to someone with a concerning pathogen, and so forth. In short order, AI will be learning to use endoscopic surgical systems. Those are already robotic. Get the video feed and controls passing through a ML system and watch it learn. Probably start out with redundant tasks like vascular connections that have to be connected. At first the surgeon does it. Then the AI learns to make a stitch or whatever and now the surgeon can say ""Put a stitch here. Another here. One here."" and the system does the work. Later it will learn to do the whole procedure. Basically start setting up surgical macros and then automate the whole thing later. \n\nDrug research is going to have early payouts. Drug companies will try to lock that down at first, but hopefully we can legislate for the greater good when it comes to AI discoveries so we don\'t have to fight over miracle drugs, or at the least, we get open source medical systems cranking out public domain medications that aren\'t locked down and go head to head to wipe out the medical companies so all their gear can be added to the open source team. =)\n\nSo that covers food, shelter, power, water, knowledge, and healthcare.\n\nThat covers a lot of Maslow\'s hierarchy. When money collapses, so does debt. When there\'s no debt, but your needs are met, crime takes a nosedive, so safety goes way up.']"

Puff pieces hype it up, people get worried but lose interest when the massive tsunami fails to happen instantly.\n\n2) The tsunami happens gradually. Have you ever watched footage of a tsunami roll over a city? It’s not a single wave, it’s a gigantic slow wall that seeps upward as it crawls forward. The automation of the economy doesn’t take place in the Ivy League caste of NYT journalists writing about Silicon Valley CEOs meeting with Capitol Hill staffers. It happens in middle management in medium sized firms in middle and coastal America and it takes multiple fiscal quarters and a lot of peer to peer FOMO. \n\n3) people start to panic for real now. The tsunami is here, can you get to the roof? Statistics says probably. Employees will fight a heroic retreating action against the direct absorptions of their jobs, using everything from deep firm knowledge to industry connections to the promotion escape rope to simply trusting that half our bosses share our long term fear of being replaced by a Trello board. Many will hold out for years. There are still people in real full time jobs who open Excel and the calculator app to perform arithmetic. \n\n4) Eventually, the tsunami wins and just becomes the new sea level. Many flee to higher ground and hope it’ll never come to this again. But the actual amount of dry land is smaller. The population is also bigger. Sure, every automated job leads to efficiencies that create two more jobs. But when? There was a painful frictional lag between the fall of the manufacturing towns and the rise of the knowledge economy, and in hundreds of communities, it drowned them. There are subjectively fewer jobs everywhere and objectively fewer jobs in some places, and “just move to a tech hub bro” doesn’t work when housing supply lags too and rent in moderately sized cities is up 60%. \n\n5) Credentialism rises. If social mobility is still a societal virtue, just print more requirements for an office job and you can structurally restrict accreditation. The MBA is the new Bachelor’s, and it costs $150,000 for 18 months to be competitively eligible for a $90k job that will be protected from automation.\n\n6) the new service economy reigns. Have you noticed how we still have waiters even though CS robotics majors could “solve” that automation problem with a big touchscreen and a conveyor belt? Humans like to be attended upon by other humans, even when it costs more. You may be automated by ChatGPT. But if you’re “lucky”, the Director of your office will keep you around because he likes bouncing ideas from his favorite podcast off you and likes that you attended the same school as his kid.', ""More productive employees mean less need for other employees.

We may choose not to use them for various reasons, but I can see that going either way honestly.', ""> what jobs would human level ai create for humans it couldn’t already do?\n\nNew jobs will come from all kinds of places, many of them as unknown as chatgpt was before it was announced, or even Facebook and other innovations before that. Nobody was a social media manager before social media. That'll be the case for all kinds of new jobs. Even just from chatgpt, think about the new jobs that created to help advise businesses about how to incorporate chatgpt into their workflow in a safe way. That wasn't a thing even a year ago but is now. \n\n> Truck drivers can’t all be twitch stars or Etsy producers, certainly not enough to make a living (something like top 1% of streamers are actually able to live off of steaming, the rest don’t get much at all)\n\nNot all of them will do this, sure, but some may. People will need to explore various paths and see what works for them. \n\n> there won’t be any new jobs that don’t require education because it would be an easy task to automate something that simple.\n\nThere's always going to be a cost benefit comparison. Is it cheaper to buy a bunch of robots to move stuff from my warehouse to trucks? If I'm Amazon, yes. If I'm a small business, probably the humans are cheaper. This same calculation will be everywhere. We are woefully behind in keeping up with public infrastructure in the US, and robots aren't going to be used to build roads and bridges, as keeping people employed is part of a lot of government project goals. I know it's popular to think all this stuff is going to be automated away, and a lot of it will be, but much will still remain.\n\nAnd to your point about education, yeah, some people might have to actually learn new skills. That might be college but might also be trades or even just weekend bootcamps. It's basically impossible to get construction crews to do small jobs, or plumbers to come fix a toilet, or whatever, in a lot of places (I'll say it's true in Chicago from personal experience). There is unmet demand. Some requires learning to be able to do and get a decent income. I think that's more than reasonable to expect people to do, especially when there will continue to be job training funding coming from the govt for people who get displaced. \n\n> Automation will be hitting essentially every job sector, reducing the demand for the number of workers we already have, customer service, IT, medicine, finance, all of these will be automated to some degree if not fully, where could people move to when every job needs half as many people or less to operate?\n\nDid everyone who used to work in stenopool become homeless when computers made it easier to write documents than typewriters? Did everyone who was a secretary start rioting in the streets when that job started getting condensed because more advanced computers made it easier for one person to manage the workload that a few people used to do? No because these people still have skills that can be used elsewhere, even in completely different parts of the economy. I'm not disagreeing that certain jobs will go away completely like tier 1 and tier 2 call center agents, but automation won't solve everything so there will still be a human at the end for the non automation managed issues. It's still TBD where those folks will land but they're on notice now to start figuring it out. This is the same process that has been going on for forever. When I was a kid my uncles had amazing factory jobs working for the auto industry but we knew that that industry was shifting to locations outside the US, so we didn't count on being able to do that when we were of age, and people who did work at those plants had to decide whether they waited around for the plant to eventually close and then scramble to find work, or to plan ahead and start getting into a role that wouldn't be going away.

Yet here we are today.\n\nAI will create jobs as well.\n\nPrompt engineering is one.\n\nNext there is guaranteed to be jobs where the goal is how to combat the misinformation which will come in the wake of the new AI. Just as we have had people making computer viruses and have multiple companies making anti-virus software, there will be a tug of war between those using AI for misinformation and new jobs using AI to combat that misinformation.\n\nJust because we today don’t know or are able to foresee all the jobs AI will generate doesn’t mean there will be none.\n\nBut it is so much easier to just look at jobs that may be reduced or phased out and cry wolf about that. And doesn’t help that news and media loves sensationalism and will hype up any “thousands of people will be without jobs” headline just for the dramatical clickbaits they can get.', ""You know I'm shocked considering that the automotive plant I work at barely has many employees/ers, and the most our robots can do is transport a tote about the weight of your average sink."", 'SLSS:\n\n* Every job is nearly 100% ""affected"" by automation, except purely physical ones. However, this is not a meaningful statistic because every job is ""affected"" by email.\n* More importantly, almost all jobs that are not purely physical face around 1/3 job losses.\n* The outliers are administration and legal, which get cut by nearly half. Architecture, science and finance lose more than a third. None of them lose less than a quarter.\n* The impact on computer science jobs is actually not that outsized. It\'s a hockey stick graph and it sits just before the steep rise, while the less hard hit fields are just one or two percentage points behind.\n* Food serving and transportation also face job losses, just not as many (12% and 11%).\n* Better AI apparently makes little difference; the only additional job threat at this point would be robotics.\n* There will be major productivity gains that are predicted to offset the job losses, but those traditionally manifest about 10 years after 50% of companies implement AI and there are no modern examples.\n\nThis is already looking pretty much like the Great Depression 2: Electronic Boogaloo.\n\nAnd this is just jobs directly impacted by AI. Don\'t expect hospitality and the trades to be unaffected by *one third unemployment* in every other sector. Some studies say 40% unemployment is where society unravels; it looks like we will be testing that theory soon.', 'Exactly. People are forgetting lawyers are qualified professionals. Giving legal advice is literally a statutory duty that only people who have gone through the qualification process can do.\n\nYes AI can help with drafting a contract to a certain level, perhaps auto fill some ancillary documents, but it won’t have the interpersonal connection with the client’s business as well as the advisory role lawyers play.\n\nI would like to see the day where an AI robot can jump on a teams call with the other side’s lawyers to negotiate a warranty on a contentious issue bespoke to the transaction at hand. \n\nI do agree AI being exploited to the absolute tits for banking documents which are usually standard form boring cookie-cutter guarantees and debentures etc. Not similar to a terms of service for a supplier of data consultancy services, for instance.', 'I\'m rather disinclined to believe this article.\n\nNot every firm and lawyer are drafting unique documents every single time. There\'s a lot of work in industries that just require pure repetition of documents that have already been turned into templates for non-lawyers to generate, edit, teach, etc. Which brings me to this:\n\n> AI will get rid of the lower dumb jobs lawyers don’t want to do,\n\nComputers and employees have already done this. There\'s nothing left to take away from attorneys, only low level employees. If a lawyer is filing their own work, it\'s likely because they either prefer to do it themselves, they can\'t trust their employees, it\'s 8pm and they\'re still working when no paralegals/assistants are, or (in my office) it\'s in federal court. If you have a particular document or set of documents you usually file at the beginning of every case, attorneys aren\'t handling that. People are.\n\nMore damning, is that the literal capacity to code a program that efiles documents for you has existed for more than a decade at least at this point. Most firms, from small to private firms capable of buying a jet, to massive corporate ones don\'t invest in their IT teams such that they can have someone code custom programs to speed up work. They absolutely COULD cut costs, but they aren\'t willing to spend the money and invest in that direction. On top of that, there are a lot of small firms out there that don\'t even want to spend the money on a digital case management system, let alone anything else. None of those companies are going to drop money on a market rate AI software suite, let alone allow it to run rampant on their clients\' files. And if the issue is that some company is going to have to convince people to move from one system to another system that works with AI, and the going rate is market rate for ""dumb"" systems or market rate + an AI premium on top, then it will really never happen.\n\n> My guess is you still want a lawyer to sign off on it so you’ll need a lawyer to review what the robots say is ok.\n\nThis language is somewhat vague, but attorneys have a responsibility to oversee the work being done by people underneath them. This would include programs. You can\'t just have your employees wildly submitting legal documents without your review, even if you\'re just nominally glancing over it and rubber stamping it with a digital signature. It\'s not common, but the Bar absolutely doesn\'t want attorneys letting AI handle anything beyond generation, and if there\'s going to be any question of having to edit it or double check the work to make sure all the details of some case are in the document, that job is probably going to remain with a legal assistant or paralegal, rather than going to the AI checking lawyer. Attorneys don\'t want to do non-attorney work, and Clients don\'t want to pay lawyer wages for legal assistant or paralegal work.', ""Construction [isn't](https://www.businessnewsaustralia.com/articles/fbr-assembles-next-gen-bricklaying-robot-capable-of-building-house-structure-in-just-one-day.html) immune either."", ""> Now, it seems technology will make to where the only jobs available are trade jobs.\n\nNot necessarily, there are companies working on say, [bricklaying robots](https://www.businessnewsaustralia.com/articles/fbr-assembles-next-gen-bricklaying-robot-capable-of-building-house-structure-in-just-one-day.html) for example.

But the way we do construction will probably change.\n\nFor example, I worked for a company that built houses.  Over time they mostly transitioned to panelized construction; they would build a wall, floor, roof, etc in the shop and then ship it to site.  At this point it was still guys doing the building. \n\nThen they bought a huge warehouse and a robotic system that assembled the panels.  People were laid off, but a lot of people just became operators of the machinery, instead of actually doing the work.  \n\nMy point is they still needed people on site to put it together and actually build the house, but their job might get smaller and smaller until theres not much for them to do.  Maybe a builder in the future will be more like someone assembling Ikea furniture.', ""> It could be 2 years or 5 years before they start rolling robots off the production line that can start working at a construction site.\n\nThe issue there is that a construction site is a very chaotic and dangerous place for your super expensive robot worker full of expensive sensors and servos and motors and a pricey exoskeleton, probably using fancy materials. These are components we already manufacture at insanely large scales, so there's not exactly a lot of room to optimise away the costs. These are just parts that require a lot of time and expense to build. It's the same reason why we don't have robots staffing every single McD's despite the fact that we clearly have the technology to do it already. It's just easier and cheaper to hire humans, they will self train, they will deal with unexpected events, and you can generally find more people willing to work low skill jobs fairly quickly. With robots you would have insane up front costs, continuous maintenance costs, storage costs, and you would still have to train them and update the training for each new task they need to perform, and even with all that extra work you would still be running a construction project, paying for materials, paying for deliveries, and paying for engineering work. \n\nNot only would the robot have to deal with all the chaos, but it would need to work with and around other people and robots, all moving in unpredictable ways, where the wrong action can have severe consequences for the robot, the project, and for other people.\n\nIt's a lot easier to have a bunch of people that will generally try to watch out for their own well being, give or take some OSHA approved ladder positions, and just give them a bunch of power tools to do the things that human bodies don't do well at.\n\nRather than robots at construction sites, I would expect computers dong things like automatic inspection for code compliance, task optimisation, and logistics planning. Those are all things you'll probably be able to do with your standard phone and a small monthly subscription to some online service.\n\nThat said, there are places where robots can and likely will take over when it comes to construction, and that is 3D printed houses. If your task is something that is inherently not compatible with human labor, then a specialised robot designed for that task specifically is likely to be very effective. However, in those cases you would still need humans to come in once the robot has tone the initial setup in order to lay pipes, run electrical, and finish the interior/exterior."", 'I think the larger point is that robotics are not at the point to disrupt the construction industry today, whereas AI is already at the point of disrupting the legal and finance sectors.

"[""Out of some interest, why do you think the world needs consumers? The guy with the yacht doesn't care about the rabble. He is out there in the sea, living better than any one of us. What value is there now to having hordes of masses, when work doesn't need doing by humans, and even wars are fought by robots and remote guided missiles and stuff like that?\n\nTry to imagine it from his point of view. Why would the elite care whether the masses had anything or not. They are inconsequential rabble for them: I mean, if the required production can just run itself, and what is left of the economy just caters to the hedonistic needs of those who own the land and the factories and can actually pay for anything, I bet that suits them just fine.\n\nI'm sure the masses do not look kindly upon being entirely bypassed in both production and consumption, and that means there would be certain revolutionary spirit in the air. However, unless the masses do revolt and take what the elite is not going to just give them, I think the end result of massive automation may well be just a disparity bigger than the world has ever seen. I think that in practice it would mean placative measures like UBI and from what I have seen, many people think it is good. But sitting on UBI means fundamentally that you are not producing anything into the economy, and that would worry me a great deal because charity tends to end one day. When the sweet deal of UBI is eventually over, or no longer gets you all you need to survive, you still continue to be non-productive and may become utterly pauperized.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the world is in any case running out of resources to support the increasing apsirations of billions of people, in terms of its energy, material and even food production, and the hour of dealing with the problem is getting pretty late. So, it may be that shedding a few billion useless extra mouths is being planned on some ugly whiteboard somewhere, and prospect of automation might mean that the economy (as far as the elite is concerned) doesn't even have to crash if such a thing actually gets done.\n\nSingularity does not need massive hordes of people. You don't necessarily get rich anymore by commanding large hordes of masses to work, and making them buy the shit you make with their income.
