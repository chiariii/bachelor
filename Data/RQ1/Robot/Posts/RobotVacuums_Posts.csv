"Do you trust your robot?I just got a Deebot, and I let it map my flat for the first time. I followed it around the whole time. I have a cat and dog, and I was worried about them attacking it. I also wasn't sure if it would get suck or find something that would get caught like a shoelace or some hidden cord. 

Did you trust your robot right away to just do the job without worry? Is this kind of robot anxiety normal? 

Do you robot-proof your home before cleaning?

How often do you clean?

With that said, it was like magic to watch the thing go under a chair, and almost get stuck, but figure out an elegant way out. Very cute."
"This is a serious question -- Is there a Robovac that doesn't suck? As in, it works consistently.I'm a believer in Robovacs and I desperately want to find one that works. But I have had terrible luck so far. 

First I had a Neato D7. It was awful. It constantly had issues with mapping, had a sensor malfunction, and it never ended up working as I wanted it to. I ended up getting it repaired under warranty, and it had issues again with mapping and just randomly stopping during jobs and saying it was done or saying sensors were dirty or something. Then Neato made a new app that only supported the latest devices and abandoned the old one. I eventually just stopped using it because the issues were not worth the time. 

So, I replaced it with an ECOVACS N8+ last year. It has a pretty good app (way better than the Neato app) and physically the device felt like it was built better. Well, the auto-empty bin flat out doesn't work because of a design flaw (this is well documented). Not a big deal because I probably wouldn't have used it as I don't want to buy proprietary bags. But what is a big deal, is that the vacuum just doesn't really work. It constantly has issues following the map and always needs to re-map the house. It stops in the middle of jobs for no reason or again, has issues with sensors. 

So......the point of this post is this: Is there a high-quality robovac that will just work consistently without me haven't to constantly reset it, re-map, and just overall spend time getting the thing to work? I don't trust reviewers anymore because the 2 robovacs I have bought are highly rated so I'm looking for opinions from non-reviewers."

"What would you recommend?I'm looking for a robot vacuum for my house, we have a lab that sheds like crazy and I can't keep up with it by myself. Our house is 80% medium pile carpet, but our hardwood has some rugs throughout.  My budget is around $600, so far my top picks are the Roomba J8+ (from Costco) or the Roborock Q7 Max+.

"Call for help from robot vacuum reviewersHi! I've been procrastinating getting other people to help with the wiki/sidebar and I feel bad about that. I would love to get this stuff updated, but I mainly read other people's work and don't test myself. Please comment here if you're interested and why you're qualified. Also, feel free to let me know if you have suggestions on layout, etc. I'm personally thinking of a few key sections:

* Youtubers/reviewers that we trust – potentially adding any caveats we've seen from the community along with reaching out to the reviewers to see if they have any comment
* A comprehensive and updated list of robot vacuums with their features and recommended/not
* Useful articles/videos we've seen
* A ""help me chose a robot vacuum"" template and automod (this would include things like ""I want auto empty, but not a mop""

Edit: also lmk if you are a reviewer that gets paid for reviews, we'll need to chat about how to make sure this page is not abused."

"Shark Clean App deleted all my settings and historyShark R101AE worked fine for a week. It had a daily schedule that started at 8:00 AM. Last night I heard it chime around midnight, but it didn't do anything so I thought nothing of it. This morning around 8:15 I noticed it wasn't cleaning so I looked at the app. Schedule was missing and disabled as well as the map and history. The robot was still paired to my account and seems to work fine now that I have reenabled everything. It acts like it has a map, though, there is no longer a map option anywhere in the app.

It seems to be working fine, but now I can no longer trust that it will work unattended when I'm away during the day."
"Narwal Freo vs dreametech L10As the title says, I was wondering if you guys had any ideas on the Narwal Freo vs the Dreamtech L10s Ultra.

Based on stated features, 1 difference I see between the Freo and Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra is that the Dream empties its dustbin. I have a iRobot Roomba i3 with the auto emptying base and the Cordey without an auto emptying bin... I do forget to empty Cordey sometimes and it doesn't clean when I forget to empty it... I have the mop attachment, but it does get dirty and it's just dragging the cleaning pad around even after being dirty.

Based on the stated features of the Dream and Freo, both have spinning brushes, both lift the brushes when on carpet, both have dirty and clean chambers for cleaning the brushes, both use heat to dry the brushes... The only difference (which I really like) is that the Dream auto empties the dustbin...

I only don't know much about the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra and their brand. I don't know how well they are at mapping and the obstacle avoidance compared to the stated good of the Narwal Freo. Based on the readings I've done, the Freo is pretty smart and is a really good robot vacuum. The only downside is the lack of auto emptying...

I guess I want to know if anyone had any experience with any Dreamtech products (like the W10 or something) and can say how good the app and features are. I don't want to shell out a ton of $ on an item only to wish I got the Freo even though it lacks the auto empty bin. I just am not always there, and I can't run the Roomba when I'm not home as it likes to get stuck...a lot... I'd do Cordey, but I have to get some magnet strips to tell it not to go in certain places as it doesn't get stuck unless it gets physically stuck under furniture that's too tight for it to fit under. Roomba just randomly gets ""stuck"" on nothing, and if I'm gone for say a couple of days, I can't auto empty Cordey or Freo, and those would have been the only 2 I would have trusted to run while I'm not home.

&#x200B;

So, does anyone have the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra, or any Dreamtech products? Are they any good? I'm really trying to compare to the Narwal Freo as it's the alternative for me. For all I know, I may just wait until the next Black Friday... I can't believe the prices...but I only just learned about those today. The different Narwals first, then the Dreamtech's Dream Bot  So, any help would be great. You will have some time. I'll try not to impulse buy any of them until I hear about them both. Narwal would have been a no brainer had it had the auto empty feature. I need to see more reviews on the Dreamtech's Dream Bot to decide if it's good or not...

&#x200B;

Also...anyone who has the Narwal Freo...Have you tried refilling the detergent with your own cleaning solution? Has it worked? Was it easy to do?  I have a cleaner I use on my wood floors that I usually put in my Cordey that's for wood floors. Was seeing if I could put that in there, or maybe not. It's concentrated wood cleaner, so I'd have to mix it with water if anything anyway. "
"Buying my very first robot vacuum and I need some help!Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some real help from some real people. 

TL;DR (I’m putting this here for those who don’t want to read the entire long post): I’m trying to choose a robot vacuum from Amazon, it must be able to pick up human hair and dog fur from tile floors. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so I have never owned a robot vacuum before but I have wanted one for a long, long time. Now that Amazon is having a sale and I have about $300 in amazon credit, this seems like the best time to get one. Only problem is there are so many options and I have been sitting here reading reviews for hours and I can’t decide because of course the reviews are all conflicting and confusing. I think I’ve narrowed it down to two but I am open to any other suggestions if there’s something you think is better (I do have some wiggle room on the price, as I’d like one that will work and also last). So here’s what I’m looking at now:

1. Roomba i4 + EVO ($400 with prime deal & comes with a free 3rd gen echo dot / listed price $667.98)
2. Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL ($400 / list price $600)

I live in a 2 bdrm/2bath apartment, approximately 1000sq ft. I’m a single parent with a teenager and a fluffy little yorkie mix. We all shed. Between the 3 of us, we shed a lot! There is always hair and fur everywhere. I hate vacuuming and you know the teen won’t do it so I think it would be nice to have one of these around to help me out a bit. We are quite messy, which is also part of why I put off buying one of these for so long but I’m hoping that having this will motivate us to pick up our shoes/clothes/etc off the floor. I’m tired of living in an apartment full of clutter and hair/fur. Would be great to be able to walk around barefoot in my house. I have a bona for washing the floors but it doesn’t work as well when there’s hair everywhere! Oh almost forgot to add, our apartment is all tile, no carpet or rugs.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is that it can handle picking up all the hair and fur without clogging up or anything. Ill be honest, I am not at all familiar with the Shark brand. I’ve wanted a Roomba forever but I think it’s just because it’s the one I’ve heard the most about. But I’m not going to make a choice based on name recognition alone. For all I know, the Shark is just as good or even better than the Roomba. One thing that makes me lean more towards the Shark is that it’s bagless and the Roomba bags are costly. On Amazon, I found a package of 3 replacement bags for $20 and another package with all the other replacement parts for $55. I could not find the Shark replacement filters on Amazon or even by googling it so idk the cost of those; all I found were off brand replacement parts that claim to fit but have mixed reviews on whether they actually do. Also, I’m not sure if it’s safe to use off brand replacement parts. But im clueless about this so if people who know more about it tell me it’s fine then I’m fine with it. I just worry if something goes wrong with a bad part then it will break the vacuum. Regardless, I won’t need to buy bags for the Shark so I assume it will cost less as far as replacements go. Other than that, both of these seem pretty good.

Of course, both have pros and cons. Also, both have an average of 4.3 stars on Amazon. I really just can’t read any more reviews or my head will explode. I don’t know if I can trust random websites who get a percent of every sale; I feel like this just incentives them to try to sell you on a more expensive product rather than what’s really best for you. And I honesty can’t tell what is going on with amazon reviews. I saw several reviews that made no sense. Someone actually wrote “I love it, but it leaves behind clumps of hair” (and many others are very similar to this, with 5 stars but a lot of negative stuff in the actual review). I don’t understand it… why do you love it if it isn’t doing its job? What do you love about it? Are you even a real person? Did someone pay you to put 5 stars but they don’t care what you actually write in the body of the review? I feel like either I’m going crazy or the world is or possibly both. 

So yeah, I need help. I hope there are people here who can help me. I really appreciate any and all information, suggestions, etc. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. You are true heroes!"

"Cleaning liquids for robot washingHi, I just bought a dreame d10 plus. In the instructions there is written to refill the water tank only with water and don’t use disinfectant.

I am just trying with demineralized water and normal floor detergent the result is good. I am oleò going to try with car glass cleaner liquid, but…

"roborock q7 max plus?I can't find much on this robot.

I have a long hair dog (eufy does terribly with it).
No carpets, but wood with bumps between rooms and I tend to be messy (eufy getting stuck constantly).
I have dust and dog allergy :(

I found roborock q7 max plus which is a little out of budget.. or roomba i3+
Stretching more i7+ if really really worth.. already the roborock would be outside budget.

I don't mind much for mopping (don't trust it would be great), but I need HEPA and absolutely emptying dust bin.

Thoughts?

I am mainly concerned they aren't able to go between rooms because in two there a couple of cm bump.. but ok probably can't do anything about it.

Thanks!!"
Roidme Eva vs Robock S7Anyone have thoughts on the Roidme Eva? Its pretty cheap and has cleaning of the mop built in. Not sure if its just a prototype or something since its on Indiegogo only. There seems to be a bunch of paid for videos on YouTube but not much else genuine reviews on it online. How is it compared to the Roborock S7?
"Deciding between Deebot N8 Pro+, Neabot N2 or Roborock S7+ for a medium heavily carpeted houseMy house is a multi-level house with each floor being about 500ft^2 (50m^2 ish) and is mostly carpeted. On the bottom floor, the kitchen and bathroom is hardwood but it's <15% of the area, whereas the upper floor it's only the bathrooms. 

I want something that meets the following requirements:

1.  Uses LIDAR. I don't trust iRobot's privacy with cameras
2. Has no-go zones
3. Has an auto-emptying bin
4. Works great on carpet and hardwood for vacuuming.

I don't care about mopping at all. 

So I've narrowed it down to the ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+, the Neabot N2  or the Roborock S7+.

I'm having a hard time deciding between the three. The S7+ seems the best but it is nearly $1000. The reviews for Ecovacs on Amazon make it seem like it's better for hardwood. Neabot seems to have great reviews and is significantly cheaper, but it is also a brand new company and I'm not sure how it will perform in the long run."
How often should Viomi S9 self-empty?I bought Viomi S9. Vacuuming & mopping & mapping works very nicely. Tried several runs so far. But now it happened it returned from vacuuming to the station and it did not empty itself. Is this a fault? Does it normally empty itself after EVERY run? Or does it have a smart way to know that the amount of dust is not so huge so it will maybe just empty itself after several runs or something like that? Manual says in broken english that it should empty itself after any run longer than 1 minute but I am not sure if the Chinese manual can be trusted. Better to hear from real users...

"Looking for a bot to adoptHi everyone,

Been looking before posting and didn't see anything related to this.

We  have a good duo of Roombas at work and they do a great job (vet clinic,  7 women, I let you imagine the amount of hair and dust they have to  deal with). Really pumped up by Bob & Ike (our roombas) and their  performance,  I'm looking forward into buying a vaccum robot friend to  help me keep the house clean.

Only  problem so far : I have a big ass sofa on relatively short feet : 8,5cm  (3,35in). I would have loved to adopt a Roomba, but they are all around  9,5cm (3,74in).  I've seen some models that are ""ultra slim"" with 5,5  to 8cm (2,17 - 3,14 inches), but often some obscure brands on Amazon  (and i'm not so open with the idea of my data being stored in an unknown  company's servers).

They also  tend to all have a wet cleaning feature (which I really don't need imo),  not sure if it's bullshit, if it only takes out dust, or if it really  cleans the floor well. What's your opinion on this ? If it works, any  pet-friendly detergent I can put in it ?

So my dream bot would be :

\- With an app **and secured/trusted servers** / Without an app but with a remote (no random-only mode, I don't want my bot to act like an old blind & deaf Dachshund).- From a trusted/reliable brand- 8cm (3,14in) tall or under (the hardest part)- With central rotative extractor (one or two brushes), as I don't really trust the simple vaccuming hole- Able to handle pet hairs (3 short haired cats)- (Optional)  with two lateral brushes- (Optional) with a square front end for corners

I know I'm asking a lot, but what would you recommend me with those criteria ?

(Done a lot for research too and only found the Deebot Ozmo Slim10 to answer to my wishes but at 850€ it's WAY above my budget)

Thanks to everyone who read this, best wishes to everyone for the upcoming year."
"Vacuum Bot recommendation student householdDear redditors,

can anyone recommend a budget friendly (<500€) vacuum bot? Maybe a model that has been working great in your own household.

We have a 65m^(2) appartment, no pets, girlfriend that tends to lose lots of long hair.

The following aspects are important:

\- reliable

(We thought about getting the Dreame L10s Pro for example but because of the mopping technology there seem to be lots of cases of mop or water tank malfunction, which doesn't make automation a lot of fun)

\- good vacuum performance

\- decent mopping would be neat, but I'd be ok if this is out of our price range

\- station is a nice to have but not necessary.

&#x200B;

Some of our candidates are w10 ,l10s pro, z10 all from dreame. But it doesn't have to be this specifiy brand.

Unfortunately right now the roborock s8 base model is cheaper than the s7 where i live, otherwise I'd go for a s7, but my girlfriend is not happy with the price tag.

&#x200B;

Thanks a ton in advance."
"Looking for a robot vacuum that can be mapped into a set location reliably. For example I work in a warehouse and want only a small section of the massive square footage cleaned, which robot could do this without getting lost when unsupervised?"
"Looking for upgrade inputI have \~2400 sq ft to vacuum, mostly tile and wood, in some cases with rugs over same. I've had an Ecovacs T8+ for a few years, and while it works, it has all kinds of issues: It's constantly getting stuck between chair legs or in some kind of corner, finding cables or drapes to chew on, losing it's map, the auto-empty frequently fails to empty the dustbin, etc.  I'm fed up with the amount of babysitting it needs.  Also, the mopping is frankly pretty sad. It mops after a fashion, but even with the pro attachment I'm not convinced it does much other than make the floor damp. 

While the T8+ is miles better than no robot at all, but I'd like to see something close the gap between the idea of a robot vacuum and the reality - something that I can count on to do its job reliably (preferably while having a good vacuum performance to noise ratio and preferably being effective at mopping)

Roborock seems to be reputed to have the best software, so the S7 MaxV Ultra and S8 Pro Ultra are interesting, but the prices are pretty obscene. These things are 4-5x more than I paid for my T8+, and it seems all too easy to imagine that they'll be multiples more expensive while maybe only being incrementally better than what I have now.

If their navigation is trouble-free, the mopping is effective, and they have the longevity/repairability to serve for \~10 years, then I can see them justifying their price tag, but I'm not sure that's where things are actually at today. 

Bottom line - looking for input as to whether any robot vacuum is smart enough to get through its cycle without needing a rescue and whether any of them have effective mopping. Although my interest is pointed in the Roborock direction, any input is appreciated."
"Need Help SelectingLooking for recommendations in a robotic vacuum that would best suit our needs. 

Home is single story, 1500 square feet. One pet that sheds a lot. Laminate throughout, with a couple rug runners. The laminate has been discontinued, so we live in fear of water penetrating it, it then bubbling, and having to replace the entire flooring in the home. Hence, I don’t think we really want a robot with a mopping feature; sounds like too much risk for water penetration. 

We currently have a Roomba 860 and don’t love it.  It’s dumb, scuffs the baseboards, gets stuck, needs constant emptying, doesn’t return to the dock, and is pretty underwhelming power wise. We’d spend as much as necessary for a reliable new vacuum. Any helpful suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as I’m about 20+ hours into reading reviews and still feel lost as to what is right for our situation."

I'm about to return my Eufy X8 has half the time it cannot seem to position itself and start creating a new map.

"Shag Carpets and robot vacuumsI have seen this question all over the Internet (bc I have a shag rug/carpet)


I have done some testing on this and want this info out there for anyone that it can possibly help.


Eufy 35C - this was my first robot vacuum. It has no mapping and just randomly bounces off walls but it didn't have any problem with the shag carpet. Additionally since it was under 3 inches in height, it was able to get under my couch


360 robot S5 - this thing is a beast. It's lasted me several years now with no issues. The mapping, suction, and reliability is great. It also handles the shag carpet with no problem. Only downside is that it doesn't auto empty but I don't care since it's the only vacuum I know of that can handle shag and has mapping. 


Deebot n8+ - this thing sucks, and not In a good way. Has trouble getting to its base. Decent suction. The mopping function is useless. It can't get onto the shag by itself. It's pattern of cleaning seems insane. Not efficient.


Roborock q5 - good mapping and pattern of cleaning. Suction wasn't great. Can't get onto shag. 


Tldr: if you have a shag carpet, get a eufy 35c (if you don't care about mapping) or a 360 robot s5 (if you want great mapping and better suction)"
"Looking for a quiet(ish) robot vacuum that can run while we’re working from home.(I know, I know, robot vacuums aren’t quiet. We have an older iRobot that is somehow louder than our full-size shop vacuum.)

We live in an apartment, and the flooring consists of tile, low-pile carpet/rugs, and ugly laminate fake wood.

My husband works from home, and we’d like something that we can run once a day while he’s working. If he closes the door to his office, he can still hear our robot vacuum on the other end of the apartment. The vacuum will also repeatedly headbutt the office door for 10-15 minutes because we can’t tell it to avoid certain rooms.

I don’t mind using a full-sized vacuum and carpet cleaner on weekends for deeper cleaning. A self-emptying vacuum would be ideal, as well as enough intelligence/self-awareness to not eat socks/cables. Cost isn’t a huge issue…if it’s a reliable product that meets our needs, I don’t mind paying more. 

Any recommendations for somewhat-quiet robot vacuums? Every article I’ve read recommends something different, so I thought I would try asking here. Thanks!"
"ISO of a reliable robot vacuum that DOESN’T require Wi-Fi access- do they exist?!My first robot vacuum was a Neato with a screen on top and a couple of buttons that you used to schedule cleanings, read error messages, etc. It was so simple, user-friendly and it we never had any issues with it. 

Eventually it died and I’ve since been through two pieces of crap, one was a Neato D3 and the other an Ecovacs Deebot. Neither had screens and required Wi-Fi access just to be able to start the damn things, let alone trying to figure out any error messages. 

We live in the country and our Wi-Fi sucks so it was a pain in the ass to get either of them to work reliably. I’d like to find one that doesn’t require Wi-Fi at all but I can’t seem to find any, it’s like they don’t even exist anymore. 

FWIW, we have mostly hardwood floors but some rug/carpet and a couple of cats. 

Any ideas?

"Best vac with long term reliability?My s5 just bit the dust after 18 months. We have 5 dogs and it would run every night for about an hour to keep the dog hair to a minimum. My S5 has been my favorite robot and I have recommended it to many but this untimely failure has left a bad taste in my mouth. 

I've had a D5, D7, Roomba 960, i7+ and the s5. The s5 has given me the fewest issues out of the bunch. Am I asking too much of a robot to run every evening or am I just having bad luck? Thankfully all of the others have me issues or failed relatively early so returning them or getting a replacement wasn't a big deal. 

As of now, the Deebot T8 and the Shark IQ are at the top of my list. What's the general opinion on these robots from those that own them?"

"How does Samsung Samsung VR10F71 NaviBot (SR10F71UB) hold up against new models these days?Hi all,

a friend gave me his Samsung NaviBot since he does not use it anymore and after an initial test I was hooked. Little stuff left here and there but overall it was a pretty decent experience especially following that small adorable fellow with its cute little arms around while it was doing its job.

Now the actual question: How does it hold up against the modern versions of vacuum robots? Is it considered fully outdated and performing worse than even the entry level robots nowadays or is it a viable option considering it was not a cheap model back then?

I am pretty new to this area of technology and I would have guessed that a huge leap in performance happened since 2013 when the Navibot was initially released but I could not find any reliable information on this. Maybe you guys can help me in finding an answer to this question?

I've poured over the specs and (early) reviews and am still not sure which is the best value. I'm willing to pay double for the N8 pro if it's of much higher quality, but I'd love some insight on either company/product:

* Reliability over time - once that 1 year warranty has expired, how long can I expect the product to last?
* Customer support - how easily I be able to get help if I run into problems?
* Warranty coverage (in Canada) - if something breaks, is it going to cost me $300 to ship it back for a ""free"" replacement?

*Open to other suggestions.. I have all hardwood floors. My top feature priorities are stellar object detection (needs to avoid charging cables, cat vomit, etc), mopping, and auto empty bin.*"

"Keep Ecovacs N8 Pro or switch to Dreame?I have had the Ecovacs Deebot N8 Pro Care (including various accessories) at home for a week and it does its job well and quite reliably so far.

But the numerous not so positive contributions in general to the models from Ecovacs make me ponder whether I should keep the N8 Pro Care or maybe switch to a Dreame.

I find the D9 (what is the difference between the D9 Pro and the D9 Max?), the L10, the D10 Plus and the Z10 Pro quite interesting.

In addition, the Xiaomi app appeals to me more than that of Ecovacs, and the Home Assistant integration for Dreame looks better.

I got the N8 Pro for \~€260, including the extraction station I would want to pay €400. Vacuuming is more important than wiping, apartment with 70m², 75% tiles, 25% carpet.

How would you decide?"
"Recommendations for a basic needs vacAny recommendations for a reliable but basic robot vac? 

My goal is to maintain daily pet hair (1 mixed breed dog) cleanup between weekly cleanings. It doesn’t have to mop or have a dust bin but ok with either.  Three rooms - 600-800 sq ft is my very rough guess for space.

I’d say budget is $400 max, I will run it daily but don’t expect perfection.

Any help is appreciated, I’ve been lurking here for a while but trying to sort through the posts and information is a bit overwhelming."
"Anyone tried Shellbot SL60?Currently has a great discount on Amazon although I know how they mark things up to look like a better deal than they are however, I can't find anything as good for the price range. Currently £180 for lidar, 4000pa, 5200mAh battery, with mop and vacuum. Nothing comes close. Only issue is no Alexa/Google integration, and the company website looks dodge with nothing on it. I've also read the app doesn't work on Android 13 and the app doesn't look to have been updated in a while.

Is it better to go for something like the 360 S8 that has only 2700pa, a smaller battery for £60 more but more reliable customer service and app. 

First time getting a robot vacuum and hoping to get something with lidar so it can work at night without the lights being on for a round the £200 price range."
"Roomba J8+ vs Shark AV2501SMy mother has been interested in getting a robo vacuum for quite a while but doesn't want to spend the money.

I'm going to buy one for her for christmas

I know these two are likely in two different categories based on pricing but I am more interested in the differences and what you guys think the better value is.

The Roomba at Costco I believe is $599
Vs
The shark on Amazon is $298

My parents currently only have a cat, but will likely be adding a dog in the near future, house is a good mix of hardwood/carpet

Ideally I would like whatever is going to be most self sufficient and reliable 

Edit: any suggestions outside these two are more than welcome! 

Appreciate any help!"
"Cheapest Quiet Robot?My roomba is no longer useable. I need a new vacuum robot. I have 3 deal breakers. I'm looking for the cheapest.

* No touch bumper. 
* Moves in predictable pattern, not random.
* Quiet. Preferably no vacuum and just a sweeping robot (not a mopping robot, too much maintenance.)"
"Roborock availibilty NADoes anyone know what's up with the North America avilibility of the roborocks?

"This is a serious question -- Is there a Robovac that doesn't suck? As in, it works consistently.I'm a believer in Robovacs and I desperately want to find one that works. But I have had terrible luck so far. 

First I had a Neato D7. It was awful. It constantly had issues with mapping, had a sensor malfunction, and it never ended up working as I wanted it to. I ended up getting it repaired under warranty, and it had issues again with mapping and just randomly stopping during jobs and saying it was done or saying sensors were dirty or something. Then Neato made a new app that only supported the latest devices and abandoned the old one. I eventually just stopped using it because the issues were not worth the time. 

So, I replaced it with an ECOVACS N8+ last year. It has a pretty good app (way better than the Neato app) and physically the device felt like it was built better. Well, the auto-empty bin flat out doesn't work because of a design flaw (this is well documented). Not a big deal because I probably wouldn't have used it as I don't want to buy proprietary bags. But what is a big deal, is that the vacuum just doesn't really work. It constantly has issues following the map and always needs to re-map the house. It stops in the middle of jobs for no reason or again, has issues with sensors. 

So......the point of this post is this: Is there a high-quality robovac that will just work consistently without me haven't to constantly reset it, re-map, and just overall spend time getting the thing to work? I don't trust reviewers anymore because the 2 robovacs I have bought are highly rated so I'm looking for opinions from non-reviewers."
"Looking for a quiet(ish) robot vacuum that can run while we’re working from home.(I know, I know, robot vacuums aren’t quiet. We have an older iRobot that is somehow louder than our full-size shop vacuum.)

We live in an apartment, and the flooring consists of tile, low-pile carpet/rugs, and ugly laminate fake wood.

My husband works from home, and we’d like something that we can run once a day while he’s working. If he closes the door to his office, he can still hear our robot vacuum on the other end of the apartment. The vacuum will also repeatedly headbutt the office door for 10-15 minutes because we can’t tell it to avoid certain rooms.

I don’t mind using a full-sized vacuum and carpet cleaner on weekends for deeper cleaning. A self-emptying vacuum would be ideal, as well as enough intelligence/self-awareness to not eat socks/cables. Cost isn’t a huge issue…if it’s a reliable product that meets our needs, I don’t mind paying more. 

Any recommendations for somewhat-quiet robot vacuums? Every article I’ve read recommends something different, so I thought I would try asking here. Thanks!"
"Any suggestions? The best one for tile to carpet transition (low pile)Hi there! I am using the Roborock S5 max and I love it. However, my baby is getting old so it's time to retire her :( We have 2 dogs that shed quite a lot so we run it everyday. 

What we need are:

1. I don't necessary need to mob the floor cause I do it by myself.
2. I'm not opposed to dust self cleaning though. It's not a deal breaker and I can do it myself as well.
3. The floor we use it regularly is about 1200 sq st.
4. It consists of hardwood and low pile carpet. I am looking for anything that would make a smooth transition between 2 different flooring. My old lady Roborock is so LOUD when she drop her body from carpet to hardwood and she bulldozer forward without a blink!
5. Of course I would need precise mapping cause I love that features, all that no-go zones stuff is AMAZING.

open to the discussion! And thank you so much for your tips!"
shark ai self empty not cleaning whole houseso my shark will clean most of the 850 sqft mainfloor but will consistantly miss about 2 rooms. The map looks good. This is just pushing clean in the app. I am new to shark robots so any help would be great.
"Shark AI self empty XL mapping/location issue. Model RV2520A0US.Just purchased this a few weeks ago, and no matter how many times I've tried re-mapping, it always seems to get the location wrong. Ex. I tell it to go to the laundry room, and it goes to my bedroom. I tell it to go to the kitchen, and it goes to the living room. And it's the same consistent error every time, ie laundry room only redirects to my bedroom and nowhere else, kitchen only redirects to living room, and nowhere else. It's a similar issue with spot cleaning. I tell it to spot clean a spot near its home base, and it goes to totally different corner of the apartment. It makes me think there's a bug with the way it's registering it's home base or something since it's a pretty consistent error, and the location is relative to the home base.

Again, I've tried re-mapping, deleting rooms, and restarting the app and the robot itself, but the exact same issue persists every time. I briefly spoke with a customer service rep who informed me that my firmware is already uptodate, so that's not the issue. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get more help from them since I've been busy during their business hours.

Just wondering if others have experienced this issue, and/or how I should go about troubleshooting? Or if I should just have the unit replaced?"

"Warning - Beware of Roborock Vacuums - Horrible Customer ServiceI bought a Roborock S7 last November after reading numerous online reviews describing it as the best vacuum/mop combo.  Over the last few months, the vacuum bin has consistently clogged with dog hair, to the point where it leaves clumps of dog hair and dust all over my house.  I have replaced almost all components that are able to be replaced (brush, filter, etc.) and it has not fixed the issue.

After all of this, I reached out to Roborock customer service to make a warranty claim.  They instructed me to run a number of ""tests"" with the vacuum (understandable), which I did run.  The test (picking up Cheerios) was run successfully (the Cheerios were picked up), but it still did not solve my problem with pet hair and dust not making their way into the bin.

Roborock customer service told me that the vacuum was operating correctly and that there was nothing they could do.  To make this more frustrating, their e-mail server will not allow me to respond directly to their e-mails - it cites a technical error and when I click for more information it brings me to a Google page that is all in Chinese.  I called their U.S. phone number and spoke to a nice person who essentially told me there was nothing he could do over the phone - and that all requests had to be made by e-mail to their overseas customer support.

I am highly suspicious that many of the online Roborock reviews are either: (1) bought and paid for by the company; or (2) made by fake accounts.  I post this as a warning to others - the vacuum may work great for a while, but if you ever need any customer service related to a broken part, etc., expect many roadblocks and very little help."
"Best robot vacuum and mop with self empty for hardwood floors and pet hairHello Robot Vacuum and Mop Gurus,

I am looking to buy our first robot vacuum and mop for our 2 level approximately 2000 sq foot house- we are looking to move to about a 3000-3300 square foot house(when we are able to find one in this crazy housing market) so would want to get a vac and mop that is able to handle at least that amount of space- mostly hardwood floor and tile in bathrooms and kitchen with some area rugs. We have a 7 month old Labrador retriever puppy so need the vacuum
to be able to clean pet hair. 

I have read ratings and reviews  on several
Websites - tomsguide, pcmag, rtings, wirecutter, realsimple, usatoday, goodhousekeeping, nymag, vacuum wars on youtube, etc. and they all recommend different products with some overlap. I did review a few posts on this and other reddit forums as well but would like to know what the end users like now. I am still very confused and would really appreciate your input based on your personal experiences and knowledge. Is it true that some sites are driven to push certain products more by sponsorships from their manufacturers than by actual product performance?

I went ahead and ordered the roborock s7(for $450 from amazon) the roborock e4( for $220 from amazon) - both without the auto empty bin - and the deebot t8 aivi with the auto empty bin  (for $599 from Costco) so I wouldn’t miss out on the holiday sales- though I am still not sure which one of these would best suit my purpose. I got the e4 based on the review on rtings.com, the t8 aivi based on vacuum wars and pcmag and the s7 based on pcmag’s review - probably listed elsewhere as well. 

Please recommend the best/a fairly good and reliable combined robot vacuum and mop with an auto empty bin that is available in the market today. I am located in the US and am able to return all of the 3 vacuums that I bought if theres a different one that you believe performs better. I am willing to spend upto $600 max  $750 if it really makes sense in terms of what the product delivers as compared to a cheaper one out there. 

Is the technology still evolving or are there products out there which consistently clean well and require minimal maintenance and upkeep? Based on what i have read, I don’t believe  any robot vacuum is able to completely replace a regular corded vacuum entirely but is definitely helpful as a secondary cleaning tool with a regular vac being needed to be used every couple of weeks or so- is that your experience as well?

Thank you so much and have a nice weekend."
"Fixing the T8 on simultaneous dual band networksI have a T8 AIVI with dock.  It doesn’t work consistently on simultaneous dual band networks.  I have a newer Xfinity gateway with tons of WiFi stuff on it and need an extender pod to cover the house.  

Unfortunately, Xfijity doesn’t allow dedicated 2.4ghtz and 5ghtz if you use their pods.  The T8 keeps dropping from the dual band network.  So I can’t ‘unblend’ the 2 wave bands and the Deebot can’t stay connected to them.  Happens every 2-3 weeks.  😡

In order to get back on the network, I have to reinstall the T8 and remap the house.  Argh!!!  Deebot customer service offered no solutions other than reinstalling.  $&@!

Anyone else face this and have a fix for the issue?

I can live with the crappy dust bin emptying on the dock (barely).  But the dropping from the network is driving me nuts!"
"Having trouble finding a quiet, “taller”, <$300 option.I love my Eufy11s but its “feature” of being ultra slim is actually a negative in my upstairs, where it constantly gets trapped under my furniture and cabinetry. I can’t keep stuffing random things under my furniture as makeshift barriers; it’s unsightly and a hassle. I tried the bObsweep pet hair plus purely because it’s too tall to get wedged under my furniture; while that factor worked well, I took it back because the thing is so loud I could hear it from outside, not to mention the fact that it’s an absolute moron when faced with rugs, stairs, and getting itself home. 

I have spent hours researching decibel levels of other models, but am having a hard time getting consistent answers. I’ll see one site say a robot is 58db, while another states the same model is 65-70. (Supposedly Eufy is 55, which is just  right for me.) Several options I found seem to be discontinued models. Is it possible to find a quiet-as-a-Eufy machine in a NON-slim design on my budget of <$300? The Eufy was $150 and is a dream, save for getting stuck all of the time."
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

&#x200B;

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Shark RV1001 charging base on carpetI've got a couple Shark RV1001 vacuums on separate floors in the house. They work ok, but have a consistant problem between the two. Both push the charging base from the side while cleaning, sometimes leaving it at an angle to the wall. I'm thinking about 3d printing some small spikes to stick to the bottom with double sided tape or an entire base plate, like what comes with the AE models. Anybody else come up with a solution to hooks the charging base in place on carpet?"
"Roborock S6 vs Tesvor S6?I just picked up my first robot vacuum- a Tesvor S6 for $210. The price seemed too good to pass up. It’s mostly great except the app integration through “WeBack” is an absolute dumpster fire. Massive delays on map updates, map corruption, maps disappearing, etc.

Also, when the robot gets stuck, if I reposition it even a little bit the robot tends to overlay a rotated map image over the original map and REALLY get disoriented. 

Finally, the robot only speaks 2.4GHz wifi and doesn’t play nice with NetGear Smart Connect, during setup which uses a single SSID for both frequencies . It’s possible that some of my app problems are coming from this issue. 

The price was great but given the wifi and software issues I’m not sure the value is there.

The Roborock S6 seems virtually identical, to the point where they seem like the same chassis and hardware except for the battery. It seems like it could be a possible upgrade path but if I switched I’d wonder if I would be paying more than double for the privilege of having the same problems. Does anyone have relevant experience? Does the Roborock support 5GHz wifi? How good is the app integration (map quality/consistency/latency) How good is the robot at reorienting itself if I need to move it?"
"Roborock S50 Max vs Deebot Ozmo 950 vs 360 s7Hi guys,

Looking to get my first robotic vacuum and mop after being fed up of all the daily cleaning during the pandemic. The size of the apartment is roughly 1200 sq. ft. The flooring consists of marble, tiled hard floor and no carpets (unless the mats count). Also, I live in India so it can get dusty here pretty quickly.

After getting confused by 100s of options out there, I've managed to zero down on these:

1. [Roborock S50 Max](https://www.amazon.in/Roborock-Navigation-Selective-Cleaning-Powerful/dp/B084M6SG7S/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2HI2B03YTBZCH&dchild=1&keywords=roborock+s7&qid=1601401173&sprefix=roborock+s7%2Caps%2C377&sr=8-2) (\~$700)
2. [Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 950](https://www.amazon.in/Ecovacs-Vacuuming-Technology-Cleaning-Multi-Floor/dp/B0832S5FV6/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=360+s7+pro&qid=1601390007&sr=8-6) (\~$540)

Given the mentioned local prices, which one of the above is a better deal? If none of these are great, are there any other better value for money options?"
"Looking for the best mid range vacuum for tile/rugs.We just remodeled our house to be 100% porcelain tile that looks like hardwood and we are noticing consistent hair and grit from our dogs.

"Consumer Reports Jan 2018 ratings on robotic vacuums in Samsungs site. Link. And my thoughts on our 9350.We got a 9350 model. Refurb from Amazon with extended warranty. Jurys still out though with frequent CO2 error code yet nothing found in LH drive wheel. May get punted back to the seller within the 90 day thingy here pretty quick. Honestly. To me. This technology is like plastic surgery and they haven't quite worked all the bugs out of all of em to sell em n make people happy consistently. It may be just the fact I have a refurb as well. Other than that this thing vacuums as good as or better than a good stand up model. Thats a Hoover 2 pc set from Sears 10 years old. Big problems getting the mapping set as well. Seems to get hung up in places at times. About 50% of the time.
Ehh. We'll see. Hopefully this link helps people decide. I chose the higher end which was lower on the scale but does have good suction power. CR also considers cost as a ratings adjuster.

"Robot vacuum with offline nav capabilitiesHello, i am looking for an robot vacuum, which would have the best navigation capabilities in offline mode. I would like the vacuum to be able to clean multiple rooms with good accuracy. My concerns are on the privacy and security side of things. 

I have heard of some open source self hosted services which can be used in combination with rooting. I am open to all suggestions."
"Which robot vacuum is best for me?Hi there. I’ve decided to make the jump to a robot vacuum due to all the praise they seem to get. My question is which one is right for me?

The house is completely laminate/tile, no carpet at all. The things I’m looking for most is picking up dirt and dog hair, as well as mopping capabilities. I don’t really need the self depositing aspect, as I don’t think it’s worth the extra money for me. Ideally, I would like to stay under $600. I have my eye on the Roborock S6, but was looking to get more opinions. Thanks!"
"Sanity check on Roborock S7 Pro Ultra (UK)I've currently got a Xiaomi Mi robot vacuum. It has served me well but it is getting very long in the tooth.

In my searching of.options I came across the Roborock S7 Pro Ultra on offer for £960. It's considerably more than I was planning on spending, but also considerably more capable.

Would those here, with more experience, consider that a good option and price? Or are there better options out there, that I missed?"
"Which robots have dirt sensing capability?I swear that I saw videos of some robots noticing that there was dirt and they needed to go over the same area again to get the dirt. Now I cannot figure out which ones do this... or did I just imagine that this was a feature?

Thanks for any guidance!

&#x200B;

Oh, and which ones know that they are full and need to be emptied? "
"Advice - Hardwood floor, 2 cats, 1300ft open condoI've had less than stellar experiences with Robovacs through the years (a first gen Neato that did ok but got lost often) and an iLife that was inexpensive but also could never be left unattended.  I'd be willing to spend more this time if it means less hassle and better tech.

As the title says, no carpets and mainly hair/dust on hard floors. While open area there is plenty of furniture and obstacles and as such I'd prefer a good navigation system. If truly capable of doing its thing unattended, a self cleaning/emptying station would be a nice feature.

Mopping wise, again, if it's not just a gimmick but a functional feature, that would be appreciated.

No need for world breaking suction or best battery life due to limited space and floor type. A brush system that wouldn't get caught in cat hair would be a major plus (seems like the cheaper low end do this better!).

Shopping in Canada, looking at ideally a sub 500$ budget but some flexibility if truly worth it.

Thanks! :)

Edit - Went for the D10 Plus on sale at 480$ Cad, hopefully a good buy"
"Shark vacuum won't go to roomsThis is all of a sudden. It's worked great since we bought it, but now when I tell it to go to a specific room, it undocks, moves about a foot away from the dock, spins, makes it's little ""I'm done, going to dock"" sound, and then docks.

Was there a recent automatic update that may be causing this?"

"Roborock S8 Pro Ultra worth upgrade?Hey there!

My appartment has two problems the Deebot T9 Aivi isn't solving. First I have a large, black rug. Some iRobots seem to have dual Sensors so they don't think black underground is a cliff - does the new Roborock have a similar feature or is it cleaning dark undergrounds without having to cover the cliff sensors? Second I have a long haired Dog (and girlfriend). I switched from the Roborock S5 to the T9 Aivi because I had to remove big strains of tangled hairs from the brush each day. Now the Deebot needs me to do this once a week or less but the self cleaning base has problems sucking the dirt through the dust bin openings because the long pet hair jams them (especially if either the dust bin is almost full or the bag in the base is more than half full.. I hope the dual brush feature of the Roborock has the same low maintenance but how does the base compare to the Deebot or iRobots when a mess of long hair and other dirt is in the robot vaccum? Is the new S8 line capable of solving my problems or should I wait or try an iRobot?"

"HEPA filter, lidar mapping, self emptyingI've had 2 robot vacuums and LOVE not having to vacuum regularly, but both were sub-par (first had no mapping, current one has mapping but crappy software that erases the map whenever the battery dies or it gets stuck) and I'm ready to make a bigger investment in a higher quality robot vacuum. Budget is around $300-500, but I could go higher if its really worth it. 

We have 1 very hair dog and 1 cat, hardwood floors, and around 1,600 square ft house. I have allergies and my allergist told me to only buy vacuums with HEPA filtration, so thats a must. It also has to have good smart mapping with no go zones and lidar since we run the vacuum at night. Finally, I want it to be self emptying. Self cleaning brushes, etc would be a nice plus but isn't required. I have no interest in mopping capability. 

Any recommendations?"
"new homeowner and want to get robot vacuumHello,

I have a long ranch with mostly vynal floors, although one hallway and all bedrooms are carpeted. I also have a sunken living room (1 step). Besides the sunken living room step, there is only 1 small transition from foyer to a sitting room. (all vynal floor is floating so no other transitions).

&#x200B;

my main purpose it to pick up dust/lint/crumbs/dirt etc. while my wife and I are at work. We currently do not have a dog, but a baby on the way and possibly a dog soon thereafter. With that being said, I would prefer a stronger one with the capabilities to pick up dog hair and some type of senor to not go into the sunken living room.

&#x200B;

I appreciate any insight you fine folk have regarding the matter. I feel like when i try to google this, i get ads disguised as reviews.

Thank you for you help.

And would you suggest getting the auto empty function? 

Can't figure out if it would be sufficient to go D10 Plus, or if I'd be better off getting the D10S or Pro.

Hope someone's able or capable or helping. 

Have a great day!"

Is there another comparable product that has better step height? I am in EU.

"Yeedi Vac Pro 2I need a good vacuum and mop robot with good obstacle avoidance, vacuum and mop capability, The two choices I see that seem to be a good fit for me are the Yeedi Vac Pro 2 and the Roborock R7 MaxV.  The Max V, however would strain my budget. Doable, but barely. Not getting the Plus or Ultra due to cost. 


Anyone have the Yeedi Vac  Pro 2? If so, what do you like or dislike about it. Anyone return a Yeedi Vac Pro 2 for a Roborock model? If so, was the switch a huge upgrade?

Not seeing a lot of reviews in here are elsewhere about the Yeedi brand vs Roborock. What I see negative about the Yeedi seems to be in regards to its mapping ability. Curious to see opinions of current/ past users of Yeedi vacs."
"Best Mid-Range option?Hi all,

Wanting to get my first robovac, and feeling pretty confused, so I have a few questions I was hoping you could help with:

1. Is it worth spending more? Will a £1000 guy really do that much better than the £500 guy?


2. Is it worth getting a self empty station?


3. What is the best mid-range?
Amazon has a few self empty options that seem decent, but I honestly have no clue:

Laresar L6 Pro


Dreame D10 plus

For context: Multi-level home, mostly carpets, no pets (though my wife seems to shed enough to cover that)

"Shark IQ isn't working with Alexa or Google HomeI have the RV1101ARUS. We got it back in 12\21. For the first month or so it was working fine. Now when we try to have it clean a specific room with Google or Alexa it won't work. It works with the shark App though, when that in itself doesn't crash. I've been dealing with shark for over a month now. Originally they said it was a Alexa skill issue because it was working with the App. Then it dawned on me a few weeks later to just install Google home on my phone. It responds the same as Alexa. You tell it to do a specific room and it just cleans wherever it wants. So after more than 15 hours of troubleshooting on the phone, I call shark back and tell them this to try and have them send me another one through warranty. The rep then tells me that her manager has just informed her that they disabled that feature in the Alexa skill and you can only clean specific rooms with the App. I asked when they changed it and they said sometime in January. So basically around the time I first called them. The customer service at Shark works as followed. You call and get a troubleshooting tech. Then if you're lucky you get a call back from an advanced tech. Then if you're even luckier you get a call back from the advanced tech escalation team. Still waiting to hear back from them. There's no direct number. They've lied to me multiple times and I've had multiple empty promises. I don't know what else to do. I wouldn't have bought it had it not worked with the Alexa integration. All the Apps and firmware are up to date. Deleted the maps and device. Factory reset many times. Deleted Alexa skill and app. Deleted Shark App. Did all these things multiple times. Room names are all default. The best way I can explain it is that communication is a 2 way street. It's receiving them command but not processing the instructions correctly. On 2 different occasions I even had a shark advance tech live stream in to see what it was doing. Luckily I record all my phone calls with them so I have proof of all the deception. Any help would be much obliged. Also don't expect them to do any leg work in terms of talking to Alexa for you. That's all on you. What a nightmare. Literally over 15 hours on the phone and going."
"Shark AI Robot Vacuum having trouble making cleaning report mapsRecently switched from a roomba 800 to a shark AI. My roomba was sadly put in hospice care after it’s steady decline, probably from sucking one to many pee puddles from my dog who had been incontinent (he is awaiting his roomba friend in the afterlife). 

Anyway I got the shark AI, love shark products, so far love this vacuum. But I have run it 5 times (apart from the explore run) and only once (the first time) was it able to generate a cleaning report map. Ever since I get [this in my report.](https://imgur.com/a/oWTFtiu) I’ve tried clearing more obstacles but it really isn’t any different than when it originally mapped. Or maybe it’s subtly different and I don’t notice? Should I do another explore run?"
"Shark IQ robot and choosing roomsDoes anyone's Shark robot actually go to the assigned room to clean?

I have an accurate map of my floor plan, each room labled. I tell it to clean ONLY one specific room across the house, and it leaves the dock and just cleans it's base room and the rest of the house as if it wasn't assigned anything.

It's annoying to tell you the truth. You spend hundreds for the AI, and you end up having to use it like a normal cleaner, blocking it off into rooms."
"How to add Neabot to AlexaHello all. I recently purchased a neaot robot vacuum I absolutely love it. However I am totally confused of how to add it to Alexa.

"Shark app only half workingI got a new Shark XL self emptying robot today. The app on my phone receives information from the robot, charge % etc, but the robot does not respond when I tell it through the app to start or return to base. Information only going one way. Any ideas?"
"Scheduling the Shark IQ Vac to clean specific rooms one at a time.So finally figured out a way to automate the Shark by room in a schedule. I have two dogs one of which is long haired and we need the vac to run daily otherwise I have tumble weeds of hair rolling about the house. 

While the Shark IQ states is good for pet hair, they didn't have an Anatolian Shepherd in mind and we found if we do it one room at a time so it empties more frequently, it works better and the dust cup doesn't clog  

I have a few Alexa devices with the shark skill installed and configured for my account so I can use voice commands when needed. 

On my phone I went into the Alexa app and started a new routine:

-	Tap settings and select routine 
-	Tap the + sign to add a new routine 
-	Enter a name for the routine. I used '9am Shark Clean Living Room' for example so each routine is easily identified. 
-	Under 'When this happens' select Schedule 
-	Enter a time and the days of the week to run. 
-	Under 'Add action' enter in the voice commands exactly as you would speak it. 
-	EX: 'tell shark to have <insert robot name> start cleaning the Living Room'
-	pick an Alexa device to execute the command from if you have more than one. I selected the dot in the living room. 
-	Save the new routine. 

You can then go back into the routine, tap the three dots and select copy routine to make one for the next room and so on. 

I made sure all of my rooms were typed in as I have theilisted in the app. 

For the five rooms I wanted to target daily, I spaced them an hour apart for now. Once these run a few times, I'll get a better idea of the actual time they take and tighten up the schedule. 

NOTE: while the question being asked isn't verbally heard when the time kicks off, the Alexa unit will respond verbally as if you asked it."
"A Critical Review of Popular Vacuum Robot Brands**1. iRobot Roombas**

Roombas are some of the most Reliable overpriced vacuums with a stable and feature-rich app. They don't have LiDARs yet. They don't have the best navigation or object avoidance, and yet they just work.

They are some of the best-rated vacuums out there. That, however, doesn't change the fact that they are highly overpriced for not being even half as smart as most competitors.

**2. Ecovacs Deebots**

Ecovacs has an impressive range of products but only on paper. The buggy room mapping overlaps walls, misinterprets closed doors as walls, forgets room labels every single time. This makes their products totally useless which is really sad as the vacuums by themselves are impressive.

Most issues they have can be fixed with a software update. Sadly, the team hasn't been able to fix any. They'd rather spend their budget on marketing and hiring as many influencers as they can to recommend their products. I'm sure you'll witness that live in the comments section.

**3. 360 Robots**

360 has the best navigation and mapping in the market programmed by a team specialized in building driverless cars. Also, they have the laziest implementation of an Alexa Skill. You can only turn the vacuum on and off using Alexa after which you'll have to open the app anyway.

360 vacuums give you the most value for your money. However, many users have reported that these vacuums need to connect to a server in China. The vacuum is just a piece of plastic if that server is down, which is the case most of the time.

**4. Roborocks**

Roborocks are the only ones on the list that offer convenience by not trading your cleaning problem with a technical one. They are great at mapping rooms, navigating efficiently, and avoiding objects. The app is stable and has all the necessary features. The only downside is the availability of after-sales support based on your country.

**Conclusion:** While we are busy admiring technical specifications, most of us tend to forget that technology is intended to make our lives easier. In the initial phases of anything new, the work reduced is just replaced by the additional effort of dealing with the technical challenges of the product.

So far, the vacuum robot market can be summarized as follows:

**1. Vacuums that have nailed the basics of cleaning but can't deal with tricky situations:** Like the Roombas that might need your help every now and then to move the furniture around

**2. Vacuums that have mastered the tricky situations but can't get the basics right:** Like the Ecovacs with their buggy mapping and app.

**3. Vacuums that have nailed everything but turned their product into total garbage by adding a dependency over a remote server to perform basic cleaning:** Like the 360s

**4. Vacuums that are just perfect with almost everything you need but you can't buy them fearing the lack of after-sales support:** Like the Roborocks"
"Garage-competent robot vacuums?I'm looking for ways to automatically keep my garage floor clean.  One option is the  Makita DRC200Z, which is an ""industrial"" robot that could do the job, but I have zero experience with it, and it has mixed reviews.

I am guessing leaves, small rocks, mud, dust, and similar to be what it needs to gather.

I worry about the robot bonking up against the paint on my low clearance sport cars, or getting stuck and crushed under other cars.

I wonder if something with mopping capability might be a better choice?

What would you recommend for 3-car garage with nice flooring to keep it clean?"
"Does a Scoopa replacement robot exist?I've had 3 second-hand Scoobas (380/390) that serve greaty to the mission of keeping our floor clean. I don't regreat buying them, but each lasted only few months. After repairing and replacing several parts they get back to life for few months and then another part needs fixing/replacement.

I guess that evidences why iRobot decided to stop selling them, and I can see how difficult can be to build cleanin robots that mix hydraulics, electronics, pumps, etc.

I also gave a try to several mops (Braava, attached mops to vacuum cleaners, etc) which I don't think are worth. They serve their purpose to do superficial cleaning, but nothing compared to the work that the Scooba perform.

Do you think there is a real candidate that can compete with the old Scoobas? I've seen a similar product( iLife W400) which doesn't get much publicity, and my feeling is that the new iRobot mops wouldn't perform much better than the old Braavas (came from Mint)"
"Ecovacs DEEBOT OZMO T8+ is on sale at Best Buy in the USA for $449.99 ($300 price reduction)[Here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecovacs-robotics-deebot-t8-vacuum-mop-robot-with-advanced-laser-mapping-and-3d-obstacle-detection-avoidance-grey/6423195.p?skuId=6423195) is the link to the listing on the US site for Best Buy. Regular price is $749.99. It's the T8+ - the + just means it comes with the self-emptying bin. This is **not** the AIVI version with the front camera, but I have seen more favorable reviews for this version, anecdotally.

I have heard this is a common sale, but it may be a couple months before it goes on sale once this offer is over.

The N8+ (not the Pro version) is available for $499.99 from $599.99 at Best Buy as well. However, the N8 Pro+ is available on Amazon for $594.99 from $799.99, if that's to your liking instead. It's to be noted that the [OZMO Pro Mopping](https://www.amazon.com/Ecovacs-Mopping-Scrubbing-Feature-Accessory/dp/B08GH3N618/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=deebot+n8&qid=1627064335&sr=8-10) add-on is only compatible with the T8 and the T8 AIVI

&#x200B;

Overall, I have seen mixed reviews for Ecovacs including some that say the company will offer you a $100 Amazon gift card to remove a negative review, which could mean that the reviews that *are* present artificially skew positive. VacuumWars on YouTube loved the T8 AIVI and the N8 Pro and claims to not be sponsored by Ecovacs and purchased the vacs out of pocket, but some are either suspicious of this claim or outright contend it.

In my limited research, people have a lot of strong feelings about Ecovacs one way or another, and it's hard to verify the integrity of reviews that are openly sponsored, of which there are many. Some are wary of the quality of the devices due to allegedly lower manufacturing standards in China where Ecovacs is based and there are concerns over the longevity of the devices since the company is relatively young. Many complain about the quality and reliability of the app and have issues with the self-emptying bin clogging.

That being said, a lot of this is true or there is some analog for all the robot vacuum companies I have researched recently. Issues with performance, issues with veracity of reviews, lack of features or misalignment between needs of the user and the features offered by the device, quality of manufacturing, and value for money. It seems there is no perfect robot vacuum. Some decry the very notion and suggest you'd do better to get a bagged, corded Miele from 1985 off of eBay and enjoy a feat of German engineering whenever you clean your house.

In the end, I took advantage of this deal today and purchased the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8+ from Best Buy as my first ever robot vacuum. It seems worth at least trying at that price point for what is a competing top-line robovac (by some estimates) with a mopping feature. I also opted to pick up the OZMO Pro Mopping add-on from Amazon. Not on sale, but still come out around the same as I would for the N8 Pro+ at the current sale and it can't handle the mopping upgrade.

I can't speak to anyone else's needs, but me getting a fancy manual vacuum instead of a robot will result in a new stationary friend for my current vacuum that remains so very rarely used. I work from home, have a kid, another on the way, and if this little critter will give me one less thing to worry about, even if it's imperfect, it's worth the risk/investment."
"My experience: S9+ / M6 vs S5Max vs T8+I’ve been wanting to write up my experiences with these devices so far, but responded to a comment in Roomba about the S9+ and am pasting that instead. Would be happy to answer any specific questions:

I actually do have the i7 variant from Costco. As soon as it shipped the S9+ / M6 combo went on sale and jumped on it, but decided not to open the i7. Also have S5Max and T8 that I’ve been testing.

I haven’t had problems with S9+ others are having thankfully other than Roomba is less intelligent than the LIDAR technology based competitors. It takes a lot more effort to train but afterwards is mostly competent.

I will say It does clean much better, the self empty design is superior to T8, and is only one that can detect bin is full (it also has larger capacity bin than the others). IMO definitely the most sexy design. Also from an American company based in US with the best support.

On flip side is loud, takes much longer to clean than the LIDAR devices and doesn’t have real time cleaning progress like the LIDARS. It bumps into everything while training which takes 2+ runs to create the map. I joke that it’s gravitated to my subwoofer as it bumped into it constantly until I was able to create a no go zone.

The S5Max is well rounded with superior navigation. In my house you just set it and forget it. But questionable support, average cleaning and does not have auto empty.

T8 is best value for what I paid but S5Max has better navigation. The T8 often forgets how to get back to the base when I use it for mopping and self empty isn’t designed properly to empty when dander clumps up.

The S9+ is either the best and worst in every category. If price matters I’d recommend the T8 or S5Max. Even if it doesn’t you want to determine if S9+ is right for you. For a lot the i7 seems to be better.

I’m at the moment leaning towards keeping S9+ M6 (need more time with M6), but if a successor is announced anytime soon with LIDAR , I’d instantly exchange it for that.

Edit 1: background, I live in a 3 story, 3000 sqft house with dogs. Floors are hardwood with rugs in almost every room.  I don’t auto schedule as I have to pick up a few rooms in advance before I run the robot.  My goal is to run once a week. If I wait a week the T8 isn’t able to self empty as the dander becomes clumped.  The bin isn’t full but it’s an inefficient design to empty compared to room as. To avoid that I need it to run every 3 days-ish. 

I bought S5Max for $435 on Prime Day. T8 for $450 a week later at Beat Buy. i8 from Costco for $580 on BF and S9+ / M6 combo, both matching colors for $1150 from iRobot a few days later.  As mentioned I never opened the i8. 

I previously said if the T8 deal never came around I would have been perfectly happy with S5Max as it’s the best navigation in my house. My biggest complaint is the small collection bin. Otherwise it runs without much oversight needed.  This all started the giant rabbit hole where I am now. 

I also read the replacement parts for Roborock are hard to come by as they are intending these to be disposable (not sure if true). 

I really only need mopping in my kitchen as it’s connected to entries and my main bathroom with its tile floor."
"Need a robot to replace a Neato XV-11Looking for suggestions on a robot to replace a frankly very long-lived and dependable XV-11, which has died. (Dead screen and other issues.)  


I'm not expecting a replacement machine to last as long as this one did.  I bought it back when they were first released and have only had to replace batteries and give it a good decent cleaning every month. (I like maintaining machines.)  


I don't need a smartphone app.  I would prefer something with a LIDAR or optical system like the Neato has.  I'd also very much appreciate a robot that would work with magnetic strips as I find just tossing a magnetic strip down to keep it out of a temporary problem area doesn't involve much effort.  


I'd like a system that I can just push a start button on and it just goes, as the XV-11 did. I was fine with tidying the room a bit for the  XV and I don't need something that will need a lot of fussing over.

I don't need or want an integrated mop system. I currently use a Scooba with no issues on tile floors.  


We have a mixture of tile, oak flooring, and carpet.  Something with a wide cleaning bar like the Neato would be great, especially if it has a similarly powerful suction.  I don't need the vacuum to be quiet when operating.

I looked briefly at a RoboRock q5, but I can't find any confirmation that it works with magnetic strips.  If anyone knows for sure that it does, I will just go with that."
"Advice needed: vacuum/mopping combo for ca. 400€Hi everyone!

Currently, I have the old very first Xiaomi vacuum robot and think it is time to upgrade.

I want to buy one on Amazon Germany as I have gift card for it and the overall budget (including gift card) is ca. 400€. Advanced mopping is nice to have, obstacle recognition depends. I usually put everything away to get as much area as possible cleaned anyway. Auto empty dock not needed.

Initially, I thought about waiting for Roborock S8 release as the prices for S7 might drop. Instead, the S7 isn't available on Amazon anymore (at least in Germany). 😒

The second thought was Dreame L10s, currently available for 429€. But I saw some negative reviews and the fact that it leaves relatively big unmopped borders, is a no-go for me.

So right now, my list contains Ecovas T9/T9 AIVI (seems to offer most advanced features but Ecovacs devices are often reported to have issues with maps and getting randomly stuck), Ecovacs N8 Pro, Roborock Q7 Max (non+, available for 359-399€ right now), 360 S10, Dreame L10 Pro, Dreame D10S.

Does someone have experience with some of these? Which one would you pick?

Many thanks! 😁"
"Garage Robot Vacuums: Any good options?I am looking for the best option for my garage to automatically keep the floors clean of tracked in debris.

Any thoughts, recommendations, experiences, words of caution or wisdom you care to share?

======== Edit: Details below =======

(I was trying to keep my post short, but since folks asked for details, here are some needs):

Going for as spotless floors as I can get, so for my particular needs I would want to pick up all the gunk the tires track in, which is mostly:

* Small bits of gravel
* Wet and dry leaves
* Mud and dust
* Water dragged in from the car, or condensation from its air conditioning.

And then also:

* The occasional dropped screw
* Occasional human messes like a small amount of sawdust, or grass and dirt tracked in from the yard.

And then I would want:

* Minimize the chance of scratching the paint on low to the floor sportcars
* Minimize the need to service it all the time due to small dustbins and the like
* Floors clean enough for walking on with white socks would be ideal.  (My cars don't leak oil, though the occasional condensation from the air conditioner, as well as tracked in water would be normal)
* Industrial enough that small sharp pebbles or a nail or other such garage debris does not ruin the robot.
* The usual obstacle and collision avoidance so it doesn't get confused by a shoe or loose cable.
* I don't have pets, though I imagine folks looking for such a robot might want to deal with pet hair and the like.
* I don't have a budget.  I would pay for perfection, or could go cheap and disposable depending on what makes sense.  I have owned many robot mops and vacuums in the past, and presently have 2 Roborock S7 Max V Ultras, and one iRobot Bravajet, which maybe will end up in the garage as they age and are replaced.

It seems the need for a garage robot is a lot different than what you would want for hardwood or carpet floors, but there is a lot of shared functionality.

The one robot that is sort-of close to what might work is the [makita drc300](https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/DRC300Z), but it seems alone in this product category, and it is really difficult to find a review that is comprehensive enough to make the buy decision from.

"Any ideas how a robot vacuum would navigate a narrow strip of hardwood floor with rug on one side and wall on the other?I'm specifically looking at the DEEBOT T10+, and am looking around my house to see how well it might do.  That unit is also a mop, so I'm looking around my house to see how it might do before pulling the trigger.  We have a rug in my family room (floor is hardwood) and  there is one strip of wood on one side of the rug where about 1 foot of hard wood is exposed.  On the other end is a part of our fireplace.  Forgive me, I don't know what it's called but it's solid and about four inches tall.

I don't expect the vac to climb that, but I am curious what it would do about that strip?  It literally would have to be on part rug and part hardwood to go over it at all.  Any idea what might happen here?  I imagine mopping there would be completely out of the question."

"Looking for a robot vacuum that can be mapped into a set location reliably. For example I work in a warehouse and want only a small section of the massive square footage cleaned, which robot could do this without getting lost when unsupervised?"
"My experience with Eufy RoboVac X8 - I love itBefore deciding to buy this robot, I spent few weeks researching all of them, and was seriously doubting if I will be satisfied with this model, because it is not very popular compared to Roombas and Roborocks, and **literally** all the reviews I could find on YouTube were sponsored ones. This seemed very fishy to me.  
I found a few redditors to ask, who shared their experiences with owning this particular robot, and they seemed satisfied. Some other opinions that I read however, were of some people that were experiencing software issues and firmware issues (meaning the phone app and the robot not being very smart in some cases).  
So after being on the fence between RoboVac X8 and iRobot Roomba J7, I went with the Eufy, because I decided I do not need a camera, since my home is always tidied up (there are no random things on the ground, which requires a camera to detect, and ask you how to proceed).  
Also, I didn't like how the camera models are mostly dependent on good lighting conditions in order for them to work properly.  


I was very surprised to find out the robot was working very good, and there were no issues with the software. I liked how this little cutie sneaked around my whole apartment to see every inch of it, so it can create a map.  
Another surprise was when it found out on it's own where the door to the hallway was, and then divided the rooms appropriately on the map!  


My apartment is mostly low carpets, and it managed to clean them quite good, even on low suction setting. The IQ Boost also seems to work well, as it somehow decides it needs more power in some places, and then self boosts itself.  
Some people online were complaining how loud this robot was, but, like, this is a vacuum, how else would it be? Personally, I didn't find it to be too noisy **for what it is - a vacuum.**  
The virtual boundary also works really good! I have a section in the hallway, where my shoes are, so I added a No-Go Zone, and the robot worked around it very well.  


I would love it if they keep improving the phone app and the AI of the robot. Also they need to work on the brand itself, and add some personality to the robots. Currently the robot speaks with a very bland ""robotic"" voice. I would like it if they made it have some more cute, pleasant sounds and voices.  


Overall, I am very satisfied, and will definitely recommend this vacuum to friends and relatives. I am happy to support Eufy with my purchase, and would love for them to keep improving it.  
As you can tell, I am not very good at writing reviews lol, so I will happily answer any questions in the comments."
"ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+ ReviewFirst off lets start by saying that I've tried...  
Roomba i7  
Roomba j7  
Roborock s7  


I personally think ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro is the best robot that I've had to date, especially for it's price on the market. I'm confused as to why I was recommended against getting it. I'm confused why these other robots get far better ratings than this one.  


**Pros**

* Has ""workable"" object avoidance.
* Is capable of mopping where you can even set the water flow.
* Avoids carpets if mop is attached (can be a pro or con depending on your layout).
* Lidar system that works extremely well.
* Is capable of going on medium pile carpet and rugs without getting stuck.
* Isn't dumb as a ^(robo)rock.
* Great app with a lot of functionality and customization which most robots don't have.

**Cons**

* Has as much cliff sensitivity as the J7, which is overly high and avoids even slightly dark carpets, but can be fixed with a workaround.
* Had a few issues here and there at first, such as getting on the charging station and avoiding objects, but it sorted itself out and functioned better the second time around, most likely because it was still learning.
* Rollers get a lot of hair stuck in them unlike the silicone ones, can be issue with pet owners, but I'm not one so I don't really care.
* Battery life is pretty low especially if you have carpets, but if you vacuum one room at a time or have it finish what it left off, you shouldn't have any real problems.
* Does not have a light like the J7 to assist with object avoidance.

**Controversy**

* There is absolutely nothing wrong with the app. I never had any issues with it thus far and it functions better than any other robot app that I've used. There is plenty of customization and the ability to tell the robot to vacuum a box area I set myself, is truly impressive. I am perplex as to what people are talking about and I'm assuming there must of been issues in the past, but as a new customer, I see no problems with it at all. Everything must have been ironed out and fixed.
* The self emptying bin has always fully sucked up debris from the robot's canister. I don't have pets, so maybe that's why, but my wife does have very long hair and her hair is also thick. We haven't thoroughly vacuumed the house for at least two weeks and even so, not a single problem. Experience may be different for pet owners, but if you're not a pet owner, then you shouldn't have an issue.

I can only assume that the people that hate this robot are pet owners and they are a majority, especially in America. However if you're not a pet owner, or if you only have a single dog that doesn't shed much, I really think this is the best purchase as of right now."
"Review of my Eufy G30 - great, but not designed to last much longer than a year.I have two dogs and a cat, and I absolutely depend on this vacuum to keep my floors clean.  Our dearest vacuum works tirelessly, day after day.  It does a great job as long as the usual hazards are kept away from the floor - strings, wires, frilly blanket ends, and stuff at just the right height to get stuck on - e.g. I put little blocks under the feet of the couch so it would have enough room to go under without getting stuck.  It picks up tons of hair, dirt, cat litter, and I love it.  
  
But this vacuum has a killer design flaw.  The mechanism that drives the main roller brush has a bearing that is not intended to be serviced.  It is deep inside the vacuum, with poor quality dust seals, and Eufy doesn't sell replacement parts for it.  This isn't the bearing at the end of the replaceable rolling brush, but just inside the vacuum where the rolling brush sockets in to the square hole for mechanical turning power.  
   
Error S5, rolling brush error.  
  
I had to completely disassemble the vacuum at just over 1 year to clean and lubricate this bearing as it refused to work and found it's dust seals worn out and basically non-existent. It's been another few months, and I'm getting error S5 again.  I'm not inclined to keep taking the vacuum apart to clean this bearing, so it's time to move on."
"Shark RV2502AE AI Honeymoon ReviewI'm a long time robot vacuum owner starting off way, way back with an early model Neato around a decade ago. I always loved the way that vacuum scanned rooms and systematically cleaned, they were way ahead of their time. When it finally went kaput after around 6 years of use, we went though 2 iRobot models and 1 off brand copy with their ridiculous random vacuuming and none lasted very long. I wanted something like my early Neato but with some more modern features and ended up with the Shark RV2502AE AI. I've had it for 2.5 weeks and here's my experience:

1. Setup was super easy...but relatively slow. Not sure if that's an issue with the bot or the app (lot's of poor reviews of the earlier version of the app), but connecting to my Wi-fi took long enough that I thought it failed and was ready to start over before it gave the A-OK. The scanning run (roughly 1000 sq ft) took about 30 minutes and was remarkably accurate. It doesn't bump into anything (cough...iRobot)
2. Run time. Shark claims the unit has 120 of run time. While the app reports roughly 120 minutes to complete a run of my 1000 sq feet, the reality is it's closer to 180 minute due to 2 stops to charge. So I think it's really run time is likely less than 100 minutes, but hard to say exactly as the programming is clever here as it appears to estimate how long it needs to work and seems to take more frequent shorter charges than draining the battery very low and then charging for a long time, today it took it's first charging break at 60% when it was also taking a break to empty the bin (more below). When it finished it was still at 30%. And after it takes a charging break, it returns exactly to where it left off to finish a run. 
3. Cleaning is great...and quiet! As mentioned above, it takes roughly 2 hours of runtime to clean my space and as I work from home noise was a concern. It's the quietest unit I've owned. It has 3 levels of power (eco, normal, and high), but I've only run it on normal. Inspection after the fact it sucked up all dust and pet hair I could see. The only places it misses are in my kitchen where my counters have a recess too small for it to fit under. The sweepers get about 1/3 underneath, but I have to hit these with a dust buster or broom if there's any visible debris. It is noisy when it auto empties the bin, but this takes maybe 5 seconds. I have mine programmed to empty every 30 minutes of runtime, but I think that maybe overkill. We have a dog and 2 kids, so maybe our house is a little messier than some, but the advertised 60 day capacity of the dust bin feels exaggerated as I've emptied it once a week so far and it's pretty full but maybe it can really pack dirt in tight. I'll try to leave it a bit longer and see how long before it notifies me to empty.
4. No-Go Zones. Within the app, you can set up block off spots you don't want the robot to clean. Why would one do that? Well...my robot got suck under my bed on a run. One side of the bed is just high enough for it to get under, but not the other.  First 2 runs it did fine but the third it got stuck trying to get out the low side and then confused by pillars under the bed. The good new is it called for help and put itself into hibernation. Again, great programming here. I've now marked that area off and it ignores it. 

So...is it worth the $450 I paid? Well...my Neato cost me around $250 in 2013 and current models run between $200 and $500. The last iRobot we bought was $450 back in 2020 and despite claiming to have ""smart mapping"" just ran around aimlessly, crashed into everything, and lasted less than 2 years. So far, the experience is far closer to my beloved Neato but with a super large bin due to the auto empty functionality. So while a bit of a splurge, certainly a much better experience than the iRobot I previous had. If it lasts, well worth it for me."
"First Robot Vacuum and Overwhelmed…Looking into getting my first robot vac, but I’m finding the process a bit overwhelming. Our primary concern is a completely automated experience (including cleaning/emptying)with great obstacle avoidance, something great with picking up pet hair (we have dogs and cats), and that can be efficient on carpet, hardwood flooring, and tile. So far the only device that seems to score very high for all of these is the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, but that price tag is scary. Does anybody have any other recommendations? Just feel a little hesitant as this is our first robot vacuum purchase."
"Shark AI Ultra - AV2511AE vs RV2502AEI cannot for the life of me figure out the difference between these two products and models. 

What I can tell so far is that [AV is white](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-AV2511AE-Self-Empty-Capacity-Navigation/dp/B09T4YZGQR), and [RV is black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J88GNW3). RV also has a HEPA filter and has 'CleanEdge'. But other than that, are these identical? Is one superior to the other? There is a $100 price difference between the two but I can't quite tell why, or which one is newer, or better, or anything really since they are so similar.

iHome Nova replacement bags that work?I ordered some from Aliexpress they were dirt cheap like 30 bags for less than $10 and they look and feel like they'd work but my vacuum CONSTANTLY clogs now. Anyone know of a good replacement bag that I guess works? I suspect their is a issue pulling air through the bag surface in these cheap bags and not enough suction is created. The iHome branded bags are $14.99 for 3 which seems nuts to me.
"Are Neato brand vacuums not really recommended anymore?Just curious as I don't see them brought up anymore. I just had my neato D3 connected finally die on me and switched to a Roomba i7+ and it left a lot to be desired. It doesn't clean nearly as well as my neato did and leaves dirt on the edges of the floors very often. The self emptying was nice, but the ""60 day capacity"" bag filled up in 3 weeks vacuuming 4 times per week. Wound up sending it back after the first 3.5 weeks and got a refund.

Black Friday sales seems like a good time to get a replacement and I see lots of recommendations for the Roomba j7 or roborock s7. Do these clean as well as the neato does? I probably have some bias as I have only ever had neato vacuums since the dawn of robot vacs and they have always cleaned well, but I want to branch out."

"Looking for Robot Vacuum recommendationsHi All,

I am looking for a good robot vacuum that doesn't burn a big hole in my pocket. A few details about my needs are -

**Home** \- 700 sq. ft. 1 Bedroom apartment in the US

**Flooring** \- Hardwood flooring in living room. Bedroom has a carpet

**Cleaning requirements** \- Mainly hair, dust, small food particles

**Price range -** $200-$300

What I am looking for -

1. Something that is fairly hands-off. I am not looking for anything too sophisticated as that would surely be expensive. But I am hoping that I don't have to intervene too much and get the robot out of difficult corners if they get stuck there
2. My hope is pretty simple. All rooms are rectangles and so is the furniture. The robot vacuum cleaner would need to go under the bed and under the couch though
3. The basic features obviously - Powerful vacuum, good capacity dust bag (I have absolutely no issues cleaning the dust bag)
4. My previous handheld vacuum required continuous cleaning of the brushes as hair and dust would get stuck there and cause them to jam. I don't know if thats avoidable but would be great to have
5. Some degree of integration with Alexa/Google so that I can voice control it. Not a deal breaker though

(4) and (5) aren't deal breakers so if I am getting a solid device for a good price which has all the basics then I am good with that.

Some options I found on Amazon. What are your thoughts? Thank you so much

Any other good devices that I did not consider?

"My experience: S9+ / M6 vs S5Max vs T8+I’ve been wanting to write up my experiences with these devices so far, but responded to a comment in Roomba about the S9+ and am pasting that instead. Would be happy to answer any specific questions:

I actually do have the i7 variant from Costco. As soon as it shipped the S9+ / M6 combo went on sale and jumped on it, but decided not to open the i7. Also have S5Max and T8 that I’ve been testing.

I haven’t had problems with S9+ others are having thankfully other than Roomba is less intelligent than the LIDAR technology based competitors. It takes a lot more effort to train but afterwards is mostly competent.

I will say It does clean much better, the self empty design is superior to T8, and is only one that can detect bin is full (it also has larger capacity bin than the others). IMO definitely the most sexy design. Also from an American company based in US with the best support.

On flip side is loud, takes much longer to clean than the LIDAR devices and doesn’t have real time cleaning progress like the LIDARS. It bumps into everything while training which takes 2+ runs to create the map. I joke that it’s gravitated to my subwoofer as it bumped into it constantly until I was able to create a no go zone.

The S5Max is well rounded with superior navigation. In my house you just set it and forget it. But questionable support, average cleaning and does not have auto empty.

T8 is best value for what I paid but S5Max has better navigation. The T8 often forgets how to get back to the base when I use it for mopping and self empty isn’t designed properly to empty when dander clumps up.

The S9+ is either the best and worst in every category. If price matters I’d recommend the T8 or S5Max. Even if it doesn’t you want to determine if S9+ is right for you. For a lot the i7 seems to be better.

I’m at the moment leaning towards keeping S9+ M6 (need more time with M6), but if a successor is announced anytime soon with LIDAR , I’d instantly exchange it for that.

Edit 1: background, I live in a 3 story, 3000 sqft house with dogs. Floors are hardwood with rugs in almost every room.  I don’t auto schedule as I have to pick up a few rooms in advance before I run the robot.  My goal is to run once a week. If I wait a week the T8 isn’t able to self empty as the dander becomes clumped.  The bin isn’t full but it’s an inefficient design to empty compared to room as. To avoid that I need it to run every 3 days-ish. 

I bought S5Max for $435 on Prime Day. T8 for $450 a week later at Beat Buy. i8 from Costco for $580 on BF and S9+ / M6 combo, both matching colors for $1150 from iRobot a few days later.  As mentioned I never opened the i8. 

I previously said if the T8 deal never came around I would have been perfectly happy with S5Max as it’s the best navigation in my house. My biggest complaint is the small collection bin. Otherwise it runs without much oversight needed.  This all started the giant rabbit hole where I am now. 

I also read the replacement parts for Roborock are hard to come by as they are intending these to be disposable (not sure if true). 

I really only need mopping in my kitchen as it’s connected to entries and my main bathroom with its tile floor."
"Shark LZ600 SeriesThere are two important questions that anyone who is  looking for a good vacuum cleaner to buy always ask: How is the  performance? and How well-designed is it?                   

Though the questions may seem very simple, in  reality, not many models on the market can truly answer these questions.  The LZ600-series turned out to be one of the few models that managed  this.

That’s not to say it’s perfect, mind you. But if it’s an affordable,  lightweight stick vacuum that you seek, I am confident that these  vacuums LZ600, LZ601, LZ602 will do the job well.

## Shark APEX UpLight Reviews

This vacuum series is the company’s answer to the rise of lightweight  stick vacuums. For years, Shark’s reputation and sales figure were  dominated by their popular line-ups of upright vacuums like the Shark  Navigator and Rotator.

Although Shark’s uprights still sell like hotcakes, it’s undeniable  that they have lost their luster. After all, why use a heavy, bulky, and  ugly upright when you can have a lighter and more stylish stick vacuum  elsewhere such as a Dyson? 

So that’s how this vacuum model was born: as a statement that Shark  is changing its image. Fortunately, from what I have seen, this is a  very effective statement. The UpLights are among the most popular and  well-rated stick vacuums today.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ecyszkgf381.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c3622533c2030046dbef7725b811ae4c8140468

 

### How Is the Performance?

To answer the first question that I set out at the beginning of the  article, my overall impression of the Shark APEX UpLight’s performance  is very good.

When tested, this vacuum was able to deal with a wide range of  contaminants without a hiccup. It can efficiently sweep up dust and  stubborn dirt. Debris — both small and large — was dealt with quickly.  Particularly stubborn and difficult particles like pet hair don’t seem  to faze the UpLight very much, as well.

The best thing about this vacuum, in my opinion, is that it is able  to do all of the above on every surface that I tested it on. From bare  floors to high-pile carpeting, It also was able to adapt quickly and  complete its job sufficiently.

The UpLight was able to do an almost perfect cleaning job on hardwood  floors. Its high suction sucked up just about anything that I laid in  its path. Surprisingly, even large debris was swept away by the vacuum  with ease.

Its cleaning head contains two brushes: a stiff brush for carpets and  a soft brush for bare floors. The soft brush tore apart any large  debris the UpLight encountered, allowing the suction to easily suck them  in.

Performance was similarly great on low-pile carpeting. The  stiff-bristle brush inside of the floorhead combed through the thin  piling and dug out all debris. The UpLight even managed to deal with  smaller debris like sand, which is a very tough kind of debris for any  vacuum to deal with on carpeting. They stick to the carpet fiber like  glue due to static.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Shark APEX UpLight. When I  compared it to other vacuum cleaners that I had tested, the  LZ600-series’s performance on bare floors and low-pile carpets was  better than many of them. It was even better than the Dyson V11, which  cost almost twice as much.

But like I said before the vacuum isn’t perfect.

Though it did great on bare floors and low-pile carpets, its  performance faltered slightly when it was placed on high-pile carpeting.  While it was able to clean out most dust, debris, and pet hair, the  vacuum left behind a trail of small debris along the way. So, it still  did its job acceptably well on high-pile, but don’t expect too much from  it.

All in all, the UpLight series’s performance was excellent. In fact,  it was better than I expected from a fairly affordable, sub-$300 stick  vacuum.

### How Well-Designed is it?

Shark did a good job designing LZ600-series

During my first inspection of them, I was thoroughly impressed with their modern aesthetic.

Most of the Shark vacuums that I reviewed before I got my hands on  the Shark APEX UpLights all got an outdated, bulky, and industrial look.  With this vacuum, I was pleased that the company has given them a more  refreshed, more appealing external design. Unlike its predecessors, this  machine model seems to be able to fit in well inside of a modern  21st-century household.

The vacuum is easy to use. It shouldn’t take you more than fifteen  minutes to be completely acquainted with its operation and design.  Additionally, thanks to the ergonomic handle, it is comfortable to  wield, too. That is a huge plus for people with arthritis.

As for other design characteristics like dimension and weight, I also have nothing bad to say.

In terms of dimension, the vacuum is sleek and compact.

If you ever need to maneuver it into cramped, tight spaces like the  underside of the furniture, it wouldn’t get stuck easily. As a matter of  fact, the floor head is jointed and the vacuum can be inclined close to  the ground to make fitting beneath low-ceilinged space easier.

The floor head has a pair of LED headlights to illuminate dark spaces and make it more convenient for you to clean.

However, the weight of Shark APEX UpLight is just barely acceptable.  At 11.2 pounds, it is quite heavy even for an average stick vacuum.

Nonetheless, because you can remove the suction wand and use the  vacuum separately as a handheld, its weight can be reduced. Without the  wand, the UpLight only weighs about 5 pounds.

The last important category that I assessed in the design department  is range. Just like its weight, the range of the UpLight is only  acceptable. It has a decent 30-foot long power cord. But the short  4-foot suction hose reduces its range substantially. In addition to  that, you can only use the suction hose with the suction wand removed.

Though the cleaning range can certainly be improved, this stick  vacuum will still be able to clean large areas and spaces. Therefore,  don’t worry too much if you have a large home.

## LZ600, LZ601 and LZ602: What Are the Differences?

The Shark APEX UpLight Lift-Away DuoClean series consists of three models the *LZ600*, *LZ601*, and *LZ602*. You may be wondering what are the differences between all of them.

The answer is … not a whole lot.

The LZ600, LZ601, and LZ602 are all essentially the same vacuum. They  have the same design, the same dimensions, and weight. All three also  share an identical suction motor, dust cup, and filtering system.

Two small things that set them apart are the *colors* and the *accessories*. The colors being the sole visual cue that you got to distinguish between three models.

The Shark LZ600 has a *hot pink* color scheme (Shark called it “*Magenta*”). The Shark LZ601 is painted a *bright blue* (“*Forest Mist Blue*”). The third and last model, the Shark APEX LZ602 can be distinguished via its *orange* outer paint (“*Terracotta*”).

When you unpacked each model, the selection of complementary accessories is different.

All models come with a two-slot accessory holder that can be mounted  on the suction wand. Whenever you’re done using the accessory, you can  put them onto the holder for easier storage.

Therefore, choosing which model to buy mostly boils down to what  accessory you prefer to have. If accessories aren’t important to you,  then it comes down to what color you want your vacuum to have.

 

## Shark APEX UpLight: What Are the Values You Get for the Price?

Now that we’re done with the basics, let’s delve deeper into this  vacuum. Specifically, what are the things that make this vacuum such a  popular model?

Powerful suction

Most of the reviews coming from past users all mentioned the vacuum’s  surprisingly strong suction. During my personal tests, the suction that  this compact vacuum was able to produce was pretty bizarre to witness,  too. 

 There are two factors that contribute to a vacuum’s suction power: the suction motor itself and the path of the airflow.

Firstly, the suction motor. The Shark APEX UpLight corded Lift-Away  comes with a decent 700-watt motor. It is capable of producing more than  enough suction to clean anything that you may have in mind.

The motor is a little bit underpowered compared to most other corded  vacuums (which tend to have 1,000-Watt and up motors). Nonetheless,  considering the fact that Shark was attempting to design as light and  compact a stick vacuum as possible here, the reduced motor is  forgivable.

Besides the motor, a second (and arguably more important) factor that  affects suction performance is the airflow’s path. If the path isn’t  optimized, the airflow is going to be weakened when it passes through  the vacuum.

Fortunately, Shark has integrated into the LZ600-series what it  called “HyperVelocity Suction” design. The airflow is streamlined to  reduce as much suction loss as possible.

Together, the strong suction motor and HyperVelocity suction give the  vacuum excellent suction performance. This suction is particularly  useful for cleaning bare floors and surfaces.

### Self-Cleaning, DuoClean Brushrolls

One of the most distinctive aspects of this vacuum mode is the  DuoClean brushrolls. The floorhead of most vacuums on the market only  contains a single brushroll. UpLight, on the other hand, comes with two.

Inside of the UpLight’s floorhead is a stiff-bristle brushroll for  cleaning carpets. Right next to it is a soft-bristle brushroll for  cleaning bare floors. Together, they can scrub out stubborn dirt and  debris on all kinds of surfaces.

In addition to having two brushrolls, the floorhead also has a  special “Self-Cleaning'' design. If you’re a pet owner, the brushrolls  can resist being tangled up by pet hair. It is easier for you to pick  out hair clumps from the bristles of the UpLight’s brushrolls, too.

 

### Lift-Away Pod

Most Shark vacuums today come with a “Lift-Away” pod. If you don’t  know what that is, basically, the pod is the core of the vacuum. It  contains the vacuum motor, the dust cup, the filtering system, and all  the other essential components.

The special part about this pod is that it is *detachable*.

 Just by pressing a button, you can transform this one from a stick vacuum to a *canister vacuum*. Just attach a suction hose to the pod!

The UpLight’s Lift-Away pod is small and portable enough that if you attach a dusting brush to it, you can also use it as a *handheld vacuum*.

In other words, you get a 3-in-1 vacuum. The Shark APEX UpLight can  be a stick vacuum, a canister vacuum, or a handheld vacuum as needed.  This versatility is one of the biggest reasons why the UpLight has  gained so much traction on the selling chart.

When detached from the larger stick vacuum frame, the Lift-Away pod  only weighs around 5 pounds. The extra portability means you can use the  vacuum to perform more jobs than previously would either be very  uncomfortable to do.

Car cleaning, for example, is now easier. Cleaning the stairs and the ceiling is much less of a hassle, too.

 Dust Cup

The dust cup is fairly small.

According to Shark, the cup has a maximum capacity of 2.8 dry quarts.  The actual capacity is much smaller. The cup could only store around  0.63 dry quarts up the fill line. If you attempt to fill up the cup any  more than this, suction performance is reduced drastically.

Still, the cup’s size is decent enough that you would have no issues  cleaning out the entire house. You won’t have to empty the cup in the  middle of a session.

 

As for how easy it is to empty, the cup is merely okay. When you  remove the cup from the vacuum, the top portion can be opened up. Then,  you have to pour the dirt inside out and into a trash can like a  pitcher.

This can present some issues. The first and biggest issue is that it  can kick up a lot of dirt in the process. If you have an allergy or are  sensitive to dust, this can be pretty irritating. You may even have to  wear a facial mask while emptying the cup.

The other problem is stuck debris. Because the cup doesn’t have a  dirt ejecting mechanism, dirt and dust can get stuck in the corners. If  you want to clean out the cup completely, you probably have to reach  your hands in to dislodge them. That’s far from hygienic in my book.

### Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology

Another one of Shark’s patented technology is similar to the  Lift-Away pod. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal is Shark’s name for the  vacuum’s *sealed construction.*

What this means is that the body is made so that it is completely  airtight. The only way for a particle to enter and escape the vacuum is  either through the front nozzle or the back vent. This also means that  any dirt particle that passes through is going to be filtered out by the  vacuum’s filtration system.

Nothing can leak through the vacuum’s body via cracks or seams.

This is great news for allergy sufferers.

&#x200B;

#  HEPA Filtration

Besides Anti-Allergen Complete Seal, this kind of machine also comes with HEPA filtration.

HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, is the best  kind of filtering system currently available commercially. For a filter  to be considered “HEPA-grade”, it must be able to filter out 99.97% of  particles smaller than 0.3 microns.

With such high efficiency, a HEPA filter isn’t just able to take out  common irritants like pollen or fine dust. It will also take care of  dangerous airborne microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, including  COVID-19.

Therefore, having HEPA filtration makes this vacuum a great choice for everyone during these difficult times.

The HEPA filter is only one part of the vacuum’s full filtering  system, however. Next to HEPA, this product also contains two  conventional filters. One is made from foam and the other is made of a  felt-like material. They help the HEPA filter by capturing large dirt  particles and debris.

 

### Are There Any Recurring Costs?

Yes, but fortunately, if you maintain the vacuum well enough, you probably won’t ever have to shell out extra money.

The filters are the only components on the vacuum that may require  replacement. However, they are designed to be washable and reusable. If  you are careful enough and give them proper cleaning every now and then,  they can last all through the vacuum’s service life.

### What’s the Maintenance Routine Like?

This is one of the very few things about the Shark APEX UpLight that I  dislike. There are a lot of parts that have to be meticulously  maintained.

The three filters have to be washed every few months. Because you  cannot machine-wash them and must rinse them out by hand, cleaning all  three filters is going to take some time.

Additionally, the dust cup must also be rinsed out frequently to  ensure that there’s no stuck debris or dirt inside that could impede the  performance.

Last but not least, you have to give the main brushroll a thorough  cleaning every once in a while to make sure that clogs won’t form. The  primary difficulty with this is that the brushroll is *not removable*. Thus, if you need to clean it, you have to lay the entire vacuum on your lap.

The brushroll cover can be removed using a flathead screwdriver. Once  removed, the brushrolls will be exposed and you can pick debris and pet  hair from the bristles.

When you finish the job, you can check the indicator light on the  vacuum to see if everything is in working order. If the light is green,  the vacuum can function normally. 

If it is red, the brushrolls are jammed and you must uncover them to try and find the clogs.

And if the light is flashing red, then the brushrolls are overheating  due to a clog somewhere. Stop the vacuum immediately or you could risk  burning out the motor.

### What Are the Accessories Like? Which One to Choose Between LZ600, LZ601 & LZ602?

Like I mentioned before, each serial number of the Shark APEX UpLight  comes with a different combination of accessories. All in all,  depending on what you get, here is a shortlist of all possible tools  that you can get:

&#x200B;

1. **1. Pet Multi-tool:** A combination tool specifically  designed to clean up pet hair and pet-related messes. Onboard is a  stiff-bristle brush for clearing out stuck, stubborn debris. There is  also an upholstery tool for you to comb off pet hair on your upholstered  furniture.
2. **2. Duster crevice tool:** Like the Pet Multi-tool,  the duster crevice tool is also a combined accessory. It has a  soft-bristle brush to help you clean sensitive surfaces like draperies  and upholstery. It also has an extendable crevice tool to help you clean  tight nooks and crannies.
3. **3. 8-inch crevice tool:** Quite self-explanatory. It  is a crevice tool that measures 8-inch long that you can use to reach  into tight corners, baseboards, and the ceiling.
4. **4. Dusting brush:** A standalone dusting brush but  with a jointed head that you can angle. Its flexibility gives you the  ability to clean high shelves, windows, and furniture and appliances in  the house.
5. **5. Self-cleaning Pet Power Brush (Turbo Brush):** The  most premium tool that UpLight offers. It is an air-driven brush that  can be used to quickly eliminate pet hair from furniture and other  surfaces. Compared to other tools like the Pet Multi-tool, the Turbo  Brush can resist being tangled by pet hair far better."
"Shark AI Ultra (AV2501S) poor cleaning performance with pet hair (poor suction?)I recently got a Shark AI Ultra with the self-empty base. I've run the robot a couple of times now (always on the ""high"" setting or ""ultraclean""); it made a reasonable map of the house, seems to go in a nice pattern that does good coverage of the room...but it seems to leave quite a bit of pet hair behind, and if I check in the base station dustbin after a run, there isn't as much hair in it as I would expect. This is particularly the case for my living room rug (my home is all hard surface floors with a rug in the living room, and a couple of small rugs in front of doors).

As a test, yesterday I ran the Shark in my living room, and then ran my old Roborock S4\* in the same room and compared how much each robot had picked up, and was surprised at how much hair the Roborock got that the Shark must have left behind.

I'm wondering if there is any troubleshooting I can do or settings to check in the app before I come to the conclusion that the Shark AI just doesn't have the ability to pick up pet hair as well as the Roborock.

&#x200B;

\*I've been generally satisfied with the performance of the Roborock S4, and the main reason I got the Shark was the bagless self-empty base. I was hoping to just schedule the vacuum to do various rooms of the house and empty the base station's bin every couple days, instead of needing to the robot's bin after and sometimes during every run. When I returned our previous Shark IQ and got the Roborock, I had said that if Shark combined their bagless, self-empty base with a LIDAR robot I'd give it a shot."
"New to mapping robots need help with schedule not performingHi... I just got an iLife t10s.  The map it drew was awesome and accurate upon first run. 

That's the good part.

I connected it to the Toya smart app first of course (how I see the map)

I ordered and named the rooms.

Then I went to timer (basically the add schedule thing) in settings.  Did so....and it wont run.  I've tried multiple times... setting different times, checking time zone of app location and all that and it doesn't want to start unless I start the ""auto clean"" button.  It works fine doing that but I'd like the automation of it working on days at certain times and such.

Any help would be appreciated.  It's pretty generic..like when you connect to the app you use the Wi-Fi robot vacuum connection.

Thank you for any thoughts here.

"Roborock S7 privacy and mopping performanceHi, 

This post is more of a reference for anyone who's searching for information on the S7 Roborock and is concerned about internet privacy/security and its mopping performance

This is **not a comprehensive review** and will **only focus on two things:** 

1. Performance without being connected to the internet ever (for those that have XL tinfoil hats like myself) 
2. Mopping performance

&#x200B;

**1. Performance despite never being connected to the internet: Great.** 

The good: 

* Easily controlled with the push buttons on the top
* Still maps the area and then vacuums in a grid pattern
* Auto detects whether it's on carpet or hard floor and changes the vacuum speed and deploys the mop
* Still returns to base to charge etc.
* Spot clean function is good for area cleaning.

The bad: 

* No idea what strength of vacuum it's on and can't change. 
* Can't change the water level of the mop either
* To do the spot clean  I have to pick the S7 up, put it in the affected area, and press the 'spot clean' rather than just telling it through an app. 

**2.  Mopping performance: poor**

The good:

* Auto detects hard floors

The bad:

* Without pre-wetting the mop it's pretty pathetic (may be related to not changing the setting in the app) 
* It doesn't raise the mop enough to not make the carpets slightly damp
* It doesn't do an amazing job of cleaning

&#x200B;

Overall: vacuum without internet connection is good, mopping is shit.   
**TLDR: If I was to buy again I would buy something with only a vacuum (maybe a J7 Roomba?)**"
"Vacuum Bot recommendation student householdDear redditors,

can anyone recommend a budget friendly (<500€) vacuum bot? Maybe a model that has been working great in your own household.

We have a 65m^(2) appartment, no pets, girlfriend that tends to lose lots of long hair.

The following aspects are important:

\- reliable

(We thought about getting the Dreame L10s Pro for example but because of the mopping technology there seem to be lots of cases of mop or water tank malfunction, which doesn't make automation a lot of fun)

\- good vacuum performance

\- decent mopping would be neat, but I'd be ok if this is out of our price range

\- station is a nice to have but not necessary.

&#x200B;

Some of our candidates are w10 ,l10s pro, z10 all from dreame. But it doesn't have to be this specifiy brand.

Unfortunately right now the roborock s8 base model is cheaper than the s7 where i live, otherwise I'd go for a s7, but my girlfriend is not happy with the price tag.

&#x200B;

Thanks a ton in advance."
"Help Me Decide: Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni vs. Roborock S7 Maxv UltraHey there, I'm in the market for a robot vacuum and I'm trying to decide between the Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni and the Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra. The Ecovacs is currently on sale for $1640 AUD, while the Roborock is priced at $2499 AUD. I've heard that the Roborock is generally considered to be the better option, but I'm wondering if the price difference is really worth it.

As a first-time robot vacuum buyer, I'm curious to hear from others who have experience with these models. Have you used either of these vacuums before? If so, what do you think of their performance, features, and overall value? And for those who have tried both, do you think the Roborock is worth the extra $859? I'd love to hear any insights or recommendations you have!"
"Looking for upgrade inputI have \~2400 sq ft to vacuum, mostly tile and wood, in some cases with rugs over same. I've had an Ecovacs T8+ for a few years, and while it works, it has all kinds of issues: It's constantly getting stuck between chair legs or in some kind of corner, finding cables or drapes to chew on, losing it's map, the auto-empty frequently fails to empty the dustbin, etc.  I'm fed up with the amount of babysitting it needs.  Also, the mopping is frankly pretty sad. It mops after a fashion, but even with the pro attachment I'm not convinced it does much other than make the floor damp. 

While the T8+ is miles better than no robot at all, but I'd like to see something close the gap between the idea of a robot vacuum and the reality - something that I can count on to do its job reliably (preferably while having a good vacuum performance to noise ratio and preferably being effective at mopping)

Roborock seems to be reputed to have the best software, so the S7 MaxV Ultra and S8 Pro Ultra are interesting, but the prices are pretty obscene. These things are 4-5x more than I paid for my T8+, and it seems all too easy to imagine that they'll be multiples more expensive while maybe only being incrementally better than what I have now.

If their navigation is trouble-free, the mopping is effective, and they have the longevity/repairability to serve for \~10 years, then I can see them justifying their price tag, but I'm not sure that's where things are actually at today. 

Bottom line - looking for input as to whether any robot vacuum is smart enough to get through its cycle without needing a rescue and whether any of them have effective mopping. Although my interest is pointed in the Roborock direction, any input is appreciated."
Looks like Shark has changed the UI in the app slightly. It might be a coincidence but I've noticed better performance from my vacuum over the last week.
"Shark RV1101 Will Not *Actually* ResetI’ve reset/power cycled everything - Shark, iPhone, AP, and UDMSE. 
I’ve opened the battery door on the Shark and unplugged it for about 15 min. 
I manually pressed the “Clean” button in the Shark and made it run until the battery died. 
I’ve removed my Shark from the app, then uninstalled/reinstalled the app. 
I’ve blocked/unblocked the MAC on my firewall
I’ve done all of this multiple times, for six hours yesterday. 

This started when I performed the (latest) factory reset on the app. Everything was “working” as in it was as crappy as usual, but even though Shark posts everywhere about how it continues to update and improve the map (LIIIES), that was not happening and it still, after 5 months of living in our new house, had not mapped the entire downstairs. 

The problem seems to be that the Shark retains my WiFi SSID/password no matter what. I don’t know how that’s physically possible if it has lost power, but as soon as I turn it on after a reset, the voice greeting is interrupted by the chime that means it’s connected to the internet and WiFi light comes on. The strange thing is that it doesn’t stay on, it blinks off and on. But not the fast blink you get when you hold the “Dock” and “Clean” buttons to initially connect - it’s a slow blink, on and off for ~5sec each. But when I look at it on my router, it shows the connection is stable with excellent signal. The problem is that I can’t remember whether or not it blinked like this when everything was working, but I am fairly confident the WiFi light was solid. 

If I proceed anyways the app says everything was successful, but I can’t control the robot with the app. Yet, if I press the physical “Clean” button, the app reflects that it’s cleaning, and all the normal options are available to me, but if I select one, let’s say I press “Pause”, the app shows that the robot is paused but the Shark ignores it and continues cleaning. If I kill the app and go back in, it shows cleaning again. Then, if I press the physical “Dock” button on the robot, the app shows it going to the dock. It shows the correct battery % and all that, so it seems there’s only one-way communication available - from the robot to the app, but not the other way around. 

I’m a network engineer and I am at a loss. The only thing I haven’t tried is changing the SSID password which might work, but I’ve also got 20 other devices on this 2.4GHz IoT network and I am not going to go around and re-connect everything just to get this POS working. 

I’ve seen one other similar post but not quite identical behavior. Is there a software bug or something right now? Does anyone know a secret way to wipe everything and start over? I’m about to take it apart and see if there’s a small battery on the motherboard for memory retention and remove that too but I don’t wanna spend another hour on this crap. 

I will never buy another Shark robot vac. This should be so simple, and they just cannot get it right. I could have cleaned my entire house 20 times over with the amount of time I’ve spent babysitting, troubleshooting, mapping, and resetting this thing. I’m about to throw it out the window."
"Roborock S7 or Dreametech D10 PlusI currently bought the Roborock S7 and I'm it's okay so far. I only need it for one floor as I live in a open concept house, with hardwood.

Currently I have a few problems with this vaccum. It's as if there is no obstacle avoidance. It bumps into everything fairly hard. Runs over wires. Pushes the docking station around. Runs into slippers and pushes them out of the way. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, but this doesnt feel like a premium vacuum bot. Also the mopping function, the mop doesn't get wet. Maybe I need to change settings.

Anyway, my question to you all is to know if the Dreamtech d10 Plus has much better performance? Or are they the same"

"Recommendations for robovacs without rollers for long hair?I've got long hair, like >1 foot long. My Roomba 670 tries to keep up like a champ, but every single moving part chokes on wound-up hairs pretty quickly, and I gotta cut it out like seatbelts in a car crash. I feel bad for the poor thing, and I wanna let it retire in peace, so I'm looking for a replacement:

\- I want to be able to perform maintenance by hand. Sliding hair off axles, for example. I don't want to keep pulling out scissors or a knife. I currently need to cut hair off both the brush and plastic rollers, side spinny brush, and all three wheels.

\- I only have hardwood -- no carpet.

\- I don't mind if I have to manually sweep up certain kinds of debris, as long as it can handle like, 80% of the dust bunnies and doesn't die doing so.

Based on what I've read here so far, it seems like I'm looking for something without roller brushes, but that they're harder to find lately? Anyone know some good places to start looking, or alternative solutions? Or do I just have tragically miscalibrated and unrealistic expectations?

Many thanks!"
"What to choose? Please help a robot newbie!Tl Dr - what is a good robot vacuum/mop hybrid, that:
is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"
"PSA on Neato Vacuums. Just Don’t! I bought a  D8 from bed bath and beyond, $200. It came brand new unopened, when i first went to clean the brushes it had the warranty sticker pre broken for me. 

It was working ok up until recently now it just gets stuck in loop where it drives a foot or two forward, starts up everything, ramps it down, and just repeats that. The app does nothing until you force reboot it. 

I’ve had robot vacuums before, i had the Electrolux Trilobite and that was miles better than this, even my S9+ is better. How did Neato mess up this badly???


PSA FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY A NEATO VACUUM. DONT! A crappy bumper robot for $80 will out perform these wastes of money. They’re so bad it feels like a scam. It’s in a wide open space and it does this."
"Best for vacuum only for medium pile carpet and multiple floors? Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, or Neato D9?Please help me pick my first robot vacuum. 

Multiple floors 1200sqft total, 1 cat, 1 human. I can speedrun vacuum my house in about 25-35 minutes, but that doesn't include stairs or multiple passes -- real ""deep"" vacuum cleaning time about 1.5 hours.  I'm looking for a way to reduce the amount of time down from 2-3 hours per week, while living in a cleaner house. 

First floor has hard floors with one area rug, second floor has mostly medium pile (.5in) carpet for bedrooms, but it's uniform cut (not berber style). 

 I have 1 senior cat that sheds some, but not excessively, but by the end of the week I can collect a decent amount of hair.  I'm looking mainly to pick up things like: crumbs in the kitchen, cat hair, litter, and general lint and dust.  No shoes upstairs, so I'm not worried about ground-in dirt in carpet. I'm also not too worried about pet mess, since I don't plan to run the vacuum when not home. It's more for after-work while I make dinner or fold laundry, or mornings when I go on a coffee run. 

Currently trying to decide between the Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, and Neato D9. Auto empty would be nice, but supporting multiple levels is a must.  Budget is about $500. I don't really need mopping, would rather have the best vacuum.

Roborock Q5+ pros: Lidar, good mapping, good app.  
Roomba j7+ pros: carpet performance, better build and support?  
Neato D9 pros: Lidar, better shape? edge cleaning? lower price.

Currently leaning towards the Roborock Q5. Any suggestions? Am I missing anything? Thanks!"
"Midea M7 pro front wheelHi all, got the vacuum on title and today the front wheel has started to get stuck while rolling, resulting in the vacuum not being able to move properly and performing some random movements, I've cleaned it from hair but i can see that while I'm rolling the wheel there is resistance at one place but can't understand why, there is nothing visible to cause the resistance. Any suggestions? Is it possible to remove the wheel? Tried but whiteout success and I'm afraid of damaging it."

"Roborock Q5 vs. Eufy X8 - they are the same price. Mostly bare floors.With various sales, both of these are about $320 right now.

The most important thing is performance on bare floors - lots of dust, dirt, and dog hair.

Thanks for the recommendation."
"Narwal Freo vs Dreame L10S Ultra?Greetings,

"High End Vac/Mop buy timingWith the patent coming to an end soon for iRobot's dual roller main brush, it looks like other OEMs are already posturing to copy it. For example, Roborock is expected to put out a model like it in April. Meanwhile I'm seriously considering an Ecovac Omni or a Roborock S7 Max Ultra. But I'd hate to spend for a premium product only for it to be completely outdated in 2 months. Does anyone have any data showing how much better the performance would be for a dual roller compared to a single roller bot? I probably should just be patient and wait for the new models."
"Problems with the newly bought Dreame F9 cleaning botI bought a new Dreame F9 cleaning bot last week. I haven't been able to make it work fully. Below are the problems faced.

1. The robot cleans a small area in a crazy pattern. It moves backward a lot hitting obstacles. And in some time, it says cleaning completed. Next time when the cleaning is restarted, it follows a different pattern in a different area (sometimes the same area also). I was hoping that this way it was building up the map. But the map doesn't seem to be accurate with respect to the position of the base station. Also, it's taking a lot of time to do this small area. So it does small areas with some overlap every time and says cleaning is completed.
2. There are 2 big problems with the bot.
   1. It never finds the base station. Even if the bot is just starting the cleaning, if I give a return to base command, it cannot find the base station. It goes all over the place and finally, voice prompt says to move the bot to the base station. 
   2. Every 5 minutes or so, the bot stops with a voice message ""obstacle detected, please reposition"". And the bot will be in an open area with no obstacles at all. And it's very frustrating because it happens almost every 5-10 minutes. If I just give the resume cleaning option in the app, it continues cleaning normally for the next 5-10 minutes.

Tried solutions:

1. Cleaned the base station and the bot (sensors).
2. Factory reset the bot and reinstalled the app.
3. Moved the base station to a lot of different positions which included a very open area also.
4. Tried in day and night conditions with different lighting.

None of this worked. Has anyone faced these kinds of problems with Dreame F9 or Xiaomi robot and how did you fix it?

Any pointers will be helpful. Thanks!"
"Large home vacuum recommendations?We're building a new home, and planning on robovac usage (not using one currently). I've been doing some research and haven't come across definitive answers based on home size. I would like vac + mop functionality with minimal maintenance, although I realize some maintenance is required. 

Relevant factors:

**Home size**: Roughly 3200 sq ft main floor, 1800 sq ft second floor. I would expect this means 2500 sq ft and 1500 sq ft of actual flooring to clean respectively (taking furniture and such into consideration).  
**Flooring**: tile/hardwood, no carpet  
**Budget**: Open   
**Other**: One large dog that sheds year round, medium-fine 1"" hair. Two kids that are somewhat messy, crumbs, minor spills.

From my reading, it seems like going with one robovacuum per floor would be easiest, but one (depending on model) should be able to cover both floors if i was open to carrying it up and down stairs.

Would any of the newer models out there have a problem cleaning 2500 sq ft?   
Would it require two, or am I well within the bounds of using a single robot?  
Would that entail a robot supporting recharge/resume functionality?  
What are the downsides if the dock is not located centrally?

Appreciate any input. I've been looking at the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, but open to other brands/models."
"Ecovacs Deebot ""Area"" mapping issuesI picked up an Ecovacs Deebot 950 yesterday.  My only prior experience with a robot vacuum was a weekend with a borrowed Roborock S6, which I really liked.  I wanted to try something different, and on paper, the Deebot is the better machine.  In practice, after only one day with the robot, I would say that they are very similar in many respects and overall, I am happy with it thus far.

&#x200B;

One area that I am frustrated by though, is the ""area"" mapping.  Since I was in a rush to play with my new toy and the battery needed a charge (5 hours by the way!), I was unable to do one complete run through of my house in Auto mode.  Instead, I used what little charge it had to map part of the house (by closing doors) and then after charging it a bit, I opened the doors and used virtual boundaries to direct it to the new areas.  This DID in fact add to the ""master"" map, but it seems to really confuse the algorithm that creates rooms (or areas as they are known in the Ecovacs app).  I had previously labelled some of the rooms, but the auto algorithm just blatted over those!

&#x200B;

Furthermore, the ""divide area"" functionality is either 100% broken, or incredibly fussy.  I have never got it to work - not once.

&#x200B;

I think what I need to do is let it map the entire house again from scratch.  This is a bit of a pain since it is not often that we are ALL out of the house for an extended period of time.  Also, I am concerned that if I ever do an ""Auto"" run and accidentally close a door, it will just blat over my labelled areas again.

&#x200B;

I'd be interested to hear some other thoughts / experiences."
"Rove L3510Is this a good vacuum?  Reviews on Walmart (almost fully 5-stars) contrast significantly with amazon (\~2.5 stars).  Hard to imagine the reviews on Walmart are not bought.

"Used Robot VacuumHello! I'm looking to buy a used robot vacuum cleaner.

I know it's a really expensive for a 1 bedroom apartment but I've been saving some money and I want to get the best thing. But I would want to buy it second hand, not only to save money but also for some other reasons of principle. What should I pay attention to?

"Robot Vacuum that gets pet hair off Carpet? Recommendations needed! :) (2021/2022)**TL;DR: Please suggest some Robot vacuum that ticks as many of the boxes below as possible. (Especially being able to do a 9/10 job at picking up dog hair off carpet.) :)**  


Also, I'm in Australia if that would affect your recommendations. :)   
\_\_

Hey guys, Lab and a Husky owner here, and... I'm sure you can imagine how much daily housework that makes. :)

I was gifted an ancient old robot vacuum a few years ago, but it was useless on carpet/rugs.  
It wasn't actually a ""vacuum"" so much as it was a robotic broom with a spinning brush. And it needed a rescue at least once a day, from it's little spot under the fridge. Always the same bloody problem!

Still my home at the time was mostly hardwood and it sort of reduced how much work I needed to do between proper cleans.

Looks like they've come a long way since then. But are they now good enough for pet hair on carpet?

I currently live in a 2 story townhouse with hardwood/tile downstairs, and a big rug. But upstairs is all carpet, and the stairs are carpeted too (So they'll always be a manual vacuum).

**I'm hoping it can pretty much genuinely replace an actual vacuum, and hoping that it:**

1. Is **safe for dog paws** and tails if they get curious. (MUST).
2. Can **do a pretty good job on carpet/rugs. I mostly mean in getting up Pet Hair,**because it wouldn't be worth it to me if I still had to clean up much more than the last 5%-10% of it. But also, just in general, I'd like it to be a good vacuum. (In most cases, the carpet/rug would be pretty short pile and a regular vaccum can do a good job, but it can take a few passes).
3. Can **Mop hard surfaces.** (Not a deal breaker if not, but super cool if it can).
4. Is pretty **good at navigating it's environment.** (Maybe maps it in real time, and/or ""learns"" it for next time so that as long as I leave the dock in the same place, it knows where obstacles were last time, and how to get back home). Can get home, even if something sends it off course. Cleans in an efficient pattern, so it can clean more area.
5. Doesn't make more work for me than it's worth. I don't want to have to rescue it from stairs, or under furniture. (**If it gets stuck... 9/10 times it should be able to figure it out**).
6. **Can get into tight spaces** (under low couches, or has **suction to pick up dirt/dust from a corner).**
7. Is smart (or programable) enough to **know that it needs to do Carpet 2-3 times to be effective.**
8. Has **Good/Smart features** (Maybe an app, and smart home enabled?). Things I haven't even mentioned here or thought about, but still **easy to use.**
9. Has **Long(ish) Battery and/or Quick Charge.** Hopefully it can finish a couple of small to medium carpeted rooms before returning home. If it runs out of power before it can, would be cool if it knew it only half finished, and would go back there when it gets a chance.
10. **Is Quiet(ish)?** My old one was pretty quiet because it didn't ""suck"", so not sure if that's realistic or not. But ... would love if it could work around me while watching TV, and if it didn't bother the dogs. But if not, I'd like to be able to schedule it for when I'm not doing stuff (or manually start over wifi or something, it even if I'm away).

Hoping I didn't just describe a $10,000 future vacuum, because that mostly seems pretty standard stuff, right? :)

Obviously cheaper is better, but **if I need to cough up more to pick up dog hair of carpet and not spend an hour a day doing it manually, I will give up my first born.** :)

I would pay extra for that one thing... but probably wouldn't care to pay a HEAP more for some of the other things on my list. (I'd live if it got stuck a little too much, or needed to charge a bit more often to finish the house, or if I had to manually finish the corners of some rooms).

Let me know if I missed anything. And feel free to tell me if there's just not a product out there that can do this, or where I might have to compromise.

Thanks!"

"Roborock s7 water tank issuesHello. 

Having to create a new account to hopefully get some help from you knowledgeable fellows. 

I had until recently been very happy with my Roborock s7. 

I then discovered that the water tank was leaking and had developed cracks. Thinking I had possibly banged it... I bought another one. 1 month later the same cracks in the same spots that gradually get worse. Buy another tank and think I should be careful and run it and keep an eye. Less than 10 runs in and more cracks. Same places that get worse with every run. They look like stress fractures as well and slowly develop all over.

I have contacted Roborock for advice or guidance to no avail and I dont want to buy another to keep spending 16 euros a month on new water tanks. 

To clarify: 
1) latest tank definitely wasn't banged, nudged or dropped. 
2) The last tank had nothing but plain water inside of it. 
3) The first cracks are always around the port for the robot nozzle that feeds water to the drip feature. 
4) The water tanks were all genuine roborock tanks. 
5) I have a grated area in my flat that I think might be an issue, but I am unsure if it's the climbing of carpet to floor or something else that could cause this. And event then.... these cracks look extreme for that. 

Happy to provide pictures if people feel they need clarification, but perhaps someone already has the same experience or an idea. Looking around I seem to have a unique issue. 

Thank you in advance."
"Aftermarket filters?Hello all, I just bought a Neato D4 and was wondering if aftermarket filters are any good for this type of robot vacuum. I'm leaning toward the genuine filters, but a 6 pack of equivalent aftermarket filters for the same price as a 2 pack of genuine filters is tempting. Let me know what you think."
"Replacement battery for irobot i8+So my irobot battery on my i8 shorted out due to water damage. It won't charge at all anymore. The base still recognizes it is connected to a robot when it's on the base. However I cannot do anything because the robot is that dead. No reset, no lights. No one is home. 

The irobot site sells a new battery for $89. Same with Amazon for a authentic one. 

What I see a lot in reviews on Amazon is ""robot does not recognize the battery,"" or ""gives battery error."" 

Does anyone know of a off brand that actually works with the robot?

Edit: I think I found one at batteries plus bulbs. At least I would have a physical place to return it"
Replacement shark ai ultraI posted the other day about being granted a replacement by shark support because my robot bricked itself.  What broke was a rv2520aous. What I received was a rv2520azus. Seems I got a much newer model even though my original was only six months old.  They must be on to a newer redesign at this point.
Can't connect to new home wifi
I recorded the 3D LiDAR sensor of the Samsung Jet Bot AI+ with my night vision security camera
"Chinese robots concernReading headlines of products like Huawei being banned for national security purposes. I feel like we should be just as concerned about products like roborock and ecovacs. Am I crazy for thinking this? And the reviews put those two manufacturers over all the others. Roomba is US based but doesn’t seem to use LIDAR. 

Yea it’s a vacuum but it is still a Chinese robot that can watch, listen, maneuver around the house at night, map out your entire house, connect to your Wi-Fi network, see when your home or away, etc. Yes, you can say the same about the US robo vacs but if they’re banning Huawei I would assume roborock and ecovac would be just as much of a security threat. Where does it end?"
"Can I fix it?My eufy l70 just dropped one of the charging sensors the other day. I purchased in May, but via Amazon renewed, so eufy says my 1yr warranty is shorted to 90 days and I’m SOL. I’m inclined to think this COULD be an easy fix, what do you think? Do vacuum repair shops even exist?"
"Bad luck or super common?I got a wyze robot vacuum for Christmas and was super excited. I got it all set up and then went to connect it to my wifi as I already have the wyze app and their security cameras. It refused to connect to the wifi, so I tried at least a dozen times, then the next day spent over an hour speaking with customer support doing everything they asked, it just wouldn't work. So I returned it and got the shark self emptying robot vacuum. It was a bit more expensive, but I like the shark brand and was hoping it would work better. I get it all set up, and it connects easily to the wifi. I go to use it after it charged and it keeps giving me error messages saying that it senses a cliff and to move it, but no matter where I move it it claims to be sensing a cliff, and it keeps saying error bin is not installed, even though it is fully clicked into place. Is this just bad luck, or why am I having such bad luck with these robot vacuums?"
"Roborock S7 privacy and mopping performanceHi, 

This post is more of a reference for anyone who's searching for information on the S7 Roborock and is concerned about internet privacy/security and its mopping performance

This is **not a comprehensive review** and will **only focus on two things:** 

1. Performance without being connected to the internet ever (for those that have XL tinfoil hats like myself) 
2. Mopping performance

&#x200B;

**1. Performance despite never being connected to the internet: Great.** 

The good: 

* Easily controlled with the push buttons on the top
* Still maps the area and then vacuums in a grid pattern
* Auto detects whether it's on carpet or hard floor and changes the vacuum speed and deploys the mop
* Still returns to base to charge etc.
* Spot clean function is good for area cleaning.

The bad: 

* No idea what strength of vacuum it's on and can't change. 
* Can't change the water level of the mop either
* To do the spot clean  I have to pick the S7 up, put it in the affected area, and press the 'spot clean' rather than just telling it through an app. 

**2.  Mopping performance: poor**

The good:

* Auto detects hard floors

The bad:

* Without pre-wetting the mop it's pretty pathetic (may be related to not changing the setting in the app) 
* It doesn't raise the mop enough to not make the carpets slightly damp
* It doesn't do an amazing job of cleaning

&#x200B;

Overall: vacuum without internet connection is good, mopping is shit.   
**TLDR: If I was to buy again I would buy something with only a vacuum (maybe a J7 Roomba?)**"
"Upgrade fail from Eufy 11s to G30. Switch to Roomba?I had an Eufy 11s for years that I was very pleased with. I had to replace it’s components (including battery) several times but it wasn’t a big deal because it was easy and parts readily available. It would start, run without complaint, and do a pretty good job. Every couple of months it would fail to make it to the base station, but no big deal. 

I upgraded to a G30 Edge because I liked the 11s so much. I have been less than impressed so far. The app is lackluster (and it doesn’t have a remote for basic use), it fails to get to the base station 50% of the time, I think the random cleaning of the 11s did a better job because the mapping sucks and the vacuum doesn’t recharge and continue as expected, its constantly complaining that I need to clean its sensors (which I then do), and my long hair tangles it weekly minimum. Stark difference in satisfaction between the two models. 

My question is do I stick with Eufy and go for an X8 or jump ship to Roomba? If so, which model?

1000 square feet of hardwood, a couple low rugs, house is kept very tidy and was previously robo-vacuum proofed by securing all cords etc. No pets, two clean adults, one with long hair. If it matters, any kind of Alexa type stuff is wasted on me. I use homekit (but not siri) for home automation. I’m capable of adding products via Home Assistant or Homebridge if supported. I’d be more than happy with a remote that has a start button though."
"The first time to try a robot vacuum. My hands are free nowMy AIRROBO T10+ is amazing. My house has all wooden/laminate flooring, no carpet. I’ve had the Vacuum now for 3 days.

On the initial run it mapped out our home and vacuumed at the same time (see pic attached - kind of looks like the millennial falcon - and yes, we have a round house). As you can see from the pic it avoided our couch (L shaped white space that it can’t go under) and other items sitting on the floor. It’s amazing to see it go around chair legs, bed posts and other things on the floor and map out a path for effective coverage of the whole house. It does remind me somewhat of R2D2 as it spins to go different directions.

&#x200B;

I highly recommend you “Reset the map” on the first run. Out of the box mine showed a partial map when I first turned it on and let it dock to charge. If you reset the map it will go out and redraw you floor plan to map out your whole house.

The vacuuming (mopping discussed later) on the T10+ works very well. As I’ve played around with the Suction Level, I settled on Strong, but it still works well even with the Quiet Level. Especially with only hard flooring. I run on Quiet mode in the mornings if the family is not awake yet. The higher the Suction Level the louder the vacuum is, but even on Max I would equate it to slightly less noise than our regular upright vacuum (which we no longer need to use).

&#x200B;

One of my dogs sheds and it picks that hair up easily. The rest of the dogs are hypo allergenic so they don’t shed. Still, it does well cleaning up the hair of the one shedder.

From a mopping perspective we have 5 dogs, so we get a lot of muck/slobber/muddy paw prints on the floors. That’s why we don’t have carpet ;) I haven’t had the chance to clean up any mud yet, but will try to post a video when that happens. For the mopping settings I’ve found I need to use the High water setting to get enough water on the floor to mop effectively. But it does a nice job of mopping.

&#x200B;

I use the reusable “cloth” mop pad and simply rinse it after each use and let it dry. I have not tried the disposable pads included in the box yet. For my house I have to replace the water one time during a whole house mopping. I forget how big the water tank is, but it’s super easy to fill and pause the Vacuum during the process.

As you can see from another pic it shows my house has 78 square meters of floor space (upstairs level) that needs cleaning and takes it about 90 minutes to do so. The Vacuum doesn’t need to recharge at all during a cleaning cycle.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ukgxgdt263b91.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c14843c773cb404d12d648d2fbde94d577242c82

I have used it a few times to select a single room to clean. That’s a really nice feature.

The circular spots on my house map are where chairs, table legs and bed posts are. The lines you see on the floor plan is the route and vacuum took to clean.

I’ve been careful to secure cords out of the way on the floor so the unit does not get caught up on those. It does try to go straight over them if they not close to a wall. It’s very persistent. I even have a couple of spots where I have floor level transitions of about 1/2 inch and it climbs over those with ease (see video).

I love how with each vacuuming or mopping session the vacuum surveys the home or rooms you are going to clean each time. It does a perimeter check first to set the boundaries for where it will clean. Sometimes I have a dog bed or two laying somewhere and it can avoid it when there, and clean that same spot when it is not there.

&#x200B;

I’ve used the remote control a couple of times just to test it out and it is very nice. At one point I used it to have the mop go back and forth on some dried dog slobber and it took a few runs to clean that up. The remote is very easy to use, but I like to just tell it to clean and run on it’s own.

&#x200B;

I have not used the Scheduling features yet, but love that it had those as well. It’s also amazing how every time it goes back to the base it automatically empties the cleaned up contents into the main unit bag. I’ll try to remember to update how long I use it before I have to replace the bag.

&#x200B;

I know there are additional features I have not use yet and not discussed here, but I really love this vacuum and would highly recommend it."
"Vacuum recs for no Wi-Fi/little tech savvyHi y’all! I’m helping my older-ish parents look for a vacuum. They don’t have Wi-Fi where they live out in the sticks. My mom is okay with a little technology, but I think the more simple the more likely they would use it. I have Roborock S7 and love it, but I think that is too expensive and has too many features that can’t/won’t use. Any recommendations? 

I’m struggling because most things I search it talks about turning off the Wi-Fi for security. That’s not the issue."
"Recommendation for carpet cleaning robot vacuum?Hey guys, I hope this is the right sub for my questions. I'd like some recommendations for a good carpet cleaning robot. Here are some of my requirements and needs.

So I have [these carpets](https://imgur.com/a/TloU2cA) in my home, and the floors are mostly covered with this kind of carpet. I have very little ""naked"" floor, and I do not plan on buying deeper carpets, so it will be mostly of this kind.  
That's why I don't really care much about hard floor vacuum performance.  
I also don't have pets, don't walk with shoes on inside, and I mostly need good performance for picking up dust/dead skin from the carpets and the hard floors here and there. I live in the city, so the dust is constant and plentiful.

About mopping, I haven't decided if I need it. Maybe it would be nice if it could mop the hard floors here and there, but I never really stain them with something. If it would help with the dust cleaning, then let's have it.

The Roombas look good for my needs, but to me they seem like they are falling behind on some of the technologies and innovations, and I'd really love to have the newest technologies. For example I'd like to have the Roborock's feature of being able to view the camera feed at all times, and even navigate the robot yourself. It's almost like a security system.

P.S. Bonus points if the robot is taller, rather than wider, as it would be easier for it to go under some of the kitchen chairs and in some corners."
"Robot vacuum with offline nav capabilitiesHello, i am looking for an robot vacuum, which would have the best navigation capabilities in offline mode. I would like the vacuum to be able to clean multiple rooms with good accuracy. My concerns are on the privacy and security side of things. 

I have heard of some open source self hosted services which can be used in combination with rooting. I am open to all suggestions."
"Looking for a bot to adoptHi everyone,

Been looking before posting and didn't see anything related to this.

We  have a good duo of Roombas at work and they do a great job (vet clinic,  7 women, I let you imagine the amount of hair and dust they have to  deal with). Really pumped up by Bob & Ike (our roombas) and their  performance,  I'm looking forward into buying a vaccum robot friend to  help me keep the house clean.

Only  problem so far : I have a big ass sofa on relatively short feet : 8,5cm  (3,35in). I would have loved to adopt a Roomba, but they are all around  9,5cm (3,74in).  I've seen some models that are ""ultra slim"" with 5,5  to 8cm (2,17 - 3,14 inches), but often some obscure brands on Amazon  (and i'm not so open with the idea of my data being stored in an unknown  company's servers).

They also  tend to all have a wet cleaning feature (which I really don't need imo),  not sure if it's bullshit, if it only takes out dust, or if it really  cleans the floor well. What's your opinion on this ? If it works, any  pet-friendly detergent I can put in it ?

So my dream bot would be :

\- With an app **and secured/trusted servers** / Without an app but with a remote (no random-only mode, I don't want my bot to act like an old blind & deaf Dachshund).- From a trusted/reliable brand- 8cm (3,14in) tall or under (the hardest part)- With central rotative extractor (one or two brushes), as I don't really trust the simple vaccuming hole- Able to handle pet hairs (3 short haired cats)- (Optional)  with two lateral brushes- (Optional) with a square front end for corners

I know I'm asking a lot, but what would you recommend me with those criteria ?

(Done a lot for research too and only found the Deebot Ozmo Slim10 to answer to my wishes but at 850€ it's WAY above my budget)

Thanks to everyone who read this, best wishes to everyone for the upcoming year."
"Any with only local network access?Just got a Roborock s4 max but after discovering its security issues, privacy policies, and network traffic usage I've decided to return it.

Are there any robot vacuums that are accessible only via local network? I don't need to turn on my vacuum from another country but I do like some of the app features.

If not, are there any recommendations for one that has decent navigation without any wifi capabilities?

Thanks"
"Charging base on carpet?Hey there everybody!

&#x200B;

I have a roborock s50 cleaning my home and there was only one spot where I could put the charging base, but it's in a very annoying place and yesterday I almost kicked it accidentally. There is only one more spot I could put it, but it is on a carpet. Is it ok to put the base on a carpet if I make sure that the base is secured in place and it is correctly levelled?"
"Shark RV1101 Will Not *Actually* ResetI’ve reset/power cycled everything - Shark, iPhone, AP, and UDMSE. 
I’ve opened the battery door on the Shark and unplugged it for about 15 min. 
I manually pressed the “Clean” button in the Shark and made it run until the battery died. 
I’ve removed my Shark from the app, then uninstalled/reinstalled the app. 
I’ve blocked/unblocked the MAC on my firewall
I’ve done all of this multiple times, for six hours yesterday. 

This started when I performed the (latest) factory reset on the app. Everything was “working” as in it was as crappy as usual, but even though Shark posts everywhere about how it continues to update and improve the map (LIIIES), that was not happening and it still, after 5 months of living in our new house, had not mapped the entire downstairs. 

The problem seems to be that the Shark retains my WiFi SSID/password no matter what. I don’t know how that’s physically possible if it has lost power, but as soon as I turn it on after a reset, the voice greeting is interrupted by the chime that means it’s connected to the internet and WiFi light comes on. The strange thing is that it doesn’t stay on, it blinks off and on. But not the fast blink you get when you hold the “Dock” and “Clean” buttons to initially connect - it’s a slow blink, on and off for ~5sec each. But when I look at it on my router, it shows the connection is stable with excellent signal. The problem is that I can’t remember whether or not it blinked like this when everything was working, but I am fairly confident the WiFi light was solid. 

If I proceed anyways the app says everything was successful, but I can’t control the robot with the app. Yet, if I press the physical “Clean” button, the app reflects that it’s cleaning, and all the normal options are available to me, but if I select one, let’s say I press “Pause”, the app shows that the robot is paused but the Shark ignores it and continues cleaning. If I kill the app and go back in, it shows cleaning again. Then, if I press the physical “Dock” button on the robot, the app shows it going to the dock. It shows the correct battery % and all that, so it seems there’s only one-way communication available - from the robot to the app, but not the other way around. 

I’m a network engineer and I am at a loss. The only thing I haven’t tried is changing the SSID password which might work, but I’ve also got 20 other devices on this 2.4GHz IoT network and I am not going to go around and re-connect everything just to get this POS working. 

I’ve seen one other similar post but not quite identical behavior. Is there a software bug or something right now? Does anyone know a secret way to wipe everything and start over? I’m about to take it apart and see if there’s a small battery on the motherboard for memory retention and remove that too but I don’t wanna spend another hour on this crap. 

I will never buy another Shark robot vac. This should be so simple, and they just cannot get it right. I could have cleaned my entire house 20 times over with the amount of time I’ve spent babysitting, troubleshooting, mapping, and resetting this thing. I’m about to throw it out the window."
"This or that: Roborock Q5 for the better navigation and mapping, or Roomba J8 for the less-likely-to-tangle-with-hair brush rolls?I bought a Roborock Q5 and it arrived a week ago. I really like it so far, app is super intuitive and the navigation seems flawless. HOWEVER, I have two Ragdoll (long-haired) cats, and I have had to clean the fur that accumulates/tangles on the brush roll basically after every single run/every other run.

Given that cat hair is the reason I got the robot vacuum in the first place, I'm tempted by the idea of getting a Roomba J8 instead. According to the Roomba subreddit certain Costcos have it on sale right now for $550 (when I looked previously, it was $700 which is out of my budget). The dual brush roll system is supposed to be better at avoiding tangled pet hair. HOWEVER, I know I'd be giving up the LIDAR navigation, and I feel like I'd be bummed to lose that. Plus, I see mixed reviews on how well the j7/j8 can ACTUALLY prevent cat hair from building up on the brush rolls, and if I sacrificed navigation and ease of use, only to discover the j8 still involved having to clean the brush roll fairly often, I'd regret it.

Thoughts?"
"What to choose? Please help a robot newbie!Tl Dr - what is a good robot vacuum/mop hybrid, that:
is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"
"Roborock S7 or Dreametech D10 PlusI currently bought the Roborock S7 and I'm it's okay so far. I only need it for one floor as I live in a open concept house, with hardwood.

Currently I have a few problems with this vaccum. It's as if there is no obstacle avoidance. It bumps into everything fairly hard. Runs over wires. Pushes the docking station around. Runs into slippers and pushes them out of the way. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, but this doesnt feel like a premium vacuum bot. Also the mopping function, the mop doesn't get wet. Maybe I need to change settings.

Anyway, my question to you all is to know if the Dreamtech d10 Plus has much better performance? Or are they the same"
"Need help troubleshooting my Eufy 11sMy Eufy 11S recently started moving way more quickly and erratically, and it will also stop after running for about ten seconds. It does one beep with a non-flashing light, which, according to the manual, means that one of the wheels is stuck. I don't see any major obstructions around the wheels; I  also unscrewed the plates around the wheels and brushed out any dust. This made zero difference. 

Other things I've done:

* Cleaned out hair that was wrapped around the swivel wheel
* Cleaned the rolling brush
* Wiped the sensors with a dry cloth
* Beat the dust out of the filters (which are still fairly new)

Anything I'm missing? I've read some reviews that these models aren't built to last (I've had mine for about 16 months), but I'm really hoping there's something I can do to fix mine."
"PSA on Neato Vacuums. Just Don’t! I bought a  D8 from bed bath and beyond, $200. It came brand new unopened, when i first went to clean the brushes it had the warranty sticker pre broken for me. 

It was working ok up until recently now it just gets stuck in loop where it drives a foot or two forward, starts up everything, ramps it down, and just repeats that. The app does nothing until you force reboot it. 

I’ve had robot vacuums before, i had the Electrolux Trilobite and that was miles better than this, even my S9+ is better. How did Neato mess up this badly???


PSA FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY A NEATO VACUUM. DONT! A crappy bumper robot for $80 will out perform these wastes of money. They’re so bad it feels like a scam. It’s in a wide open space and it does this."
"Looking for a fairly basic vacuum that can handle a rug and hard floors. Advice?Hey all,  

Looking for a robot vacuum for downstairs only. Space is prob approx 750 sq ft.  

**Flooring:** Primarily laminate planks - but they're poorly installed (rental) and can sometimes get gaps that I have to push back closed. There's also 1 shag rug with medium/high pile with a non-slip mat underneath.  

**Features:** No mopping necessary. No self-emptying necessary. I would like if it could be scheduled, but if I have to start it when leaving for work in the morning, I can do that. I do want it to self-return for charging though.  

**Budget:** $350, but a bit flexible  

I'm just getting a little overwhelmed with all these different features I've been seeing and really just want one that can get on/off the rug with little to no issue. Feel free to ask questions if there's other important information I've left off.  

Please and thanks!"
"Need a robot Vac recommendations!I have a fairly unique situation, and I’m hoping someone here could help me! I’m trying to find a good robot vacuum, preferably under $300, with stupidly specific requirements:

1. The area it will be cleaning has no wifi, so a robot that can function without any cloud connection is needed.

2. The area is about 90% high pile carpet, so one that can handle this. For reference, my Wyze robot vac gets stuck when moving forward and could only go backwards, the front wheel was too short. I bought a Shark RV2002 from Walmart and that one is able to move forward but it kinda makes a snake path instead of straight rows. This problem probably isn’t fixable..

3. The area I need cleaned is fairly large, about 60x30 feet all open area. I would need a vacuum that could either cover that much area on one charge or is able to return to base then finish vacuuming. I called Shark and they said the RV2002 (and maybe all of their vacuums?) can only continue vacuuming if they’re connected to wifi, otherwise they just give up after returning home.

I’m like 90% sure this isn’t a solvable issue, but hopefully I’m wrong. Thanks in advance for anyone willing to help!"
"Bissell A3 is almost 1/2 off, I bought one here are my thoughts.As of right now the ready clean mop head changing system is just $350.The TLDR is; I am extremely impressed and, this will replace my Roomba M6 .

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"
"Recommendation - Too much pet hair!Can you guys please give me some recommendations, I have a fairly simple requirement list:

- Primary use will be to clean pet hair throughout the house 
- Entire house is one level, and all timber flooring
- Want to run scheduled when I’m away from home, although there will be a pet inside
- Self emptying preferred
- Will need to navigate in around the kitchen table and chair legs

I’ll still be manually vacuuming every second day, so won’t be fully reliant on the robovac. 

Currently looking at a refurbished Roomba i7+, but I think it could be too over the top / overpriced for my needs."
"Cheap generic vacuumsHi there,

I probably know the answer to this, but: 

- How bad are the generic cheap ""dumb"" vacuums?

I've seen a ""pyle pure clean"" - vaccum shaped object - for sale cheap locally

I recon even that will do my 500sq ft hard floor downstairs?

Thanks to another bargain local find, I have a roomba 700 series mercilessly collecting the fluff in my (carpeted) upstairs"
"Ihome NovaI don't see the Ihome Nova listed anywhere here, so throwing my impression of it into the lists.  I had an earlier, top of the line, very expensive robotic vacuum, and gave it away after about a yr. due to poor performance.  The Ihome Nova is a top of the line robotic vacuum with a very reasonable price.  It does an excellent job, where it can reach.  I have a few pieces of furniture it can't get under, but no big deal, I get to it about once a week.  The Ihome Nova is set to vacuum early morning each day and I never have to worry about my floors.  If you have deep grouted tile, it does a fair job but is great on hardwood floors.  I have two large german shepherds who are in a year-round shed mode.  Since getting this vacuum, I can enjoy clean floors and my dogs.  It also has a wet-mopping mode; I haven't used it yet.  It is so easy to mop the floors when the hard work of getting the debris up is already done. So 5/5 stars in my opinion."
"Shark AI Ultra wit Lidar has terrible object avoidanceIt keeps trying to climb these stool pedestals and gets stuck. Honestly not sure how it can’t see them with LIDAR because the pedestals are fairly large. 

On top of that, the app is terrible and creating rooms is buggy.

Definitely do not recommend this robot."
"Can I have my robot vacuum work at night while we're asleep but not come in our room and wake us up?Sorry if this is a bit of a random question, but I'm new to robot vacuums and I just wondered if I might be able to set up a system whereby the vacuum works at night while we are asleep, but when it's on the night schedule it won't come in our bedroom and wake us up… But then at other times when it's running on a regular daytime schedule, it will be allowed in the room?

Does that make sense? I guess what I'm probably asking is, do most modern robot vacuums that allow scheduling also allow you to have multiple schedules each with their own no-go zones?"
"Advice for uneven wooden floorsHello all, I'm considering a robot vacuum purchase for my new apartment. It's a fairly large and open space, but is built into an old mill with wooden floors. The boards re not all level or flush, and there are slopes in some spots.

I'd prefer not to buy a Roomba post Amazon acquisition, but if it's the best option I'll consider it. I've also been using full size and cordless Shark vacuums for a few years and like them, but I'm not married to any particular brand.

Open to any advice or suggestions!"
Anybody else having issues With Shark and Mesh wifi network?Without fail the Shark vacuums that were recently  purchased shuts down my Linksys Wifi network. I have factory rest them multiple times and it still occurs. These are the only devices on my network that causes this issue. Needless to say the units are boxed up for return. To give shark a fair chance I will contact them for any support that they may be willing to provide. For reference the two models that I have are the RV2520 and the RV2001.
"Moving from shark rv2001We have had a shark IQ, rv2001 for a couple years now and it has done what we needed for the most part, but not without frustration.

It seems to be not quite as smart as it was when we got it, 50% of the time it can’t find a single room if you tell it to go clean one spot. The no go zones don’t really work. 

We have wood floor with a few rugs, one is fairly tufted? 

Are there any options that -
1. Actually map the house and can follow it? (I.e. not slam into the couch for 5 minutes that’s been in the same spot for 6 months?)
2. Are any of them continuously learning? (I.e. we move a nightstand, it picks up on it being open space now and adjusts for it?
3. Maybe a little more robust? The shark is very sensitive and stops a lot and needs reset.
4. Can be scheduled more than once a day? My shark can only be schedule to run at one time a day. I’d like to do half the house at 10am, the other half at 2pm, or something similar 

It doesn’t have to be the newest most recent model or anything, but obviously saving money is nice"
"Best Vac for pet hair under 1k CADI am looking suggestions as to which robot vacuum is recommended for my situation.  I see a lot of posts asking similar questions but they all seem to factor in the ability to mop and clutter avoidance which are not really factors for me.

Some of the features I mention below may or may not be standard, or I may be calling by the wrong thing. I have never owned a robot vac before, so forgive my ignorance.

**Usage / Considerations**

* Mainly used on hardwood floors/tile, plus 2 low pile area rugs.
* Main thing being vacuumed will be pet hair.
   * 1 Medium Sized Dog - Short Hair - Pit/Boxer Cross - doesn't shed too too much
   * 1 Medium Sized Dog, Medium Double Coat - Heinz 57 mutt, sheds like a husky.
   * 1 Mid Sized Cat - Long Hair - Sheds like a beast
* Light Dirt - generally brought in by dog paws and the pit/boxer cross rolling around in it and coming inside.

**Features I desire**

* Price under 1K CAD if possible
* Auto Docking/Self Empty
* Being able to set ""no go"" zones
* Sensor for stairs - Stairs are generally blocked, but I have a teenager who likes to not close things.
* Pattern cleaning (not random all over the place waste of battery/time) I believe this is a mapping feature?
* I do not want to have to constantly detangle/unplug due to pet hair. I have no issues with routine maintenance, but I seen posts talking about having to do it after every cycle for some cheap models.

**Features that do not matter to me**

* Mop function - If it has it, cool. If not, I'm not concerned.
* Noise level - I have a loud teenager, and loud dogs. Noise is irrelevant.
* Clutter Avoidance (nothing on my floors I'm concerned about)

I have spent the last few days reviewing lots of websites, videos, reddit posts, etc. They all seem to encompass everything with focus on the Mopping feature, so none really stand out for my wants. Vacuum Wars channel did help a fair bit, but again, more focus on features I'm not concerned with.

I'd rather not overspend for features I don't need/want. That being said, I am sure there are lots of features I left out, that may or may not be important factors.

Thanks in Advance, and I hope I will be able to get the answers I seek."
"Seeking recommendation for vacJust moved into a 2/1 with about 730 feet of space, nothing major. We are going to put down a fair amount of rugs, mostly low pile but probably one high pile area rug. No pets yet but we may get a cat.


I’d prefer to keep it around or under $150 but I can go to $300 if it’s worth it.


Other wishes:
* I try to buy manufacturer refurbished vs new to reduce e waste, I know irobot, eufy, and roboroc all sell refurbished on eBay 
* prefer not self emptying because I don’t want to be stuck buying their proprietary bags
* open to a mop but not required


Thanks in advance!"
"For all hardwood floors and ease of use, X1 Omni vs Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra?Hey everyone, I've done a fair amount of research so far on both of these vacuums and the general consensus I get is:

Omni:

- Better for mopping(and less work since it dries the mopping pads for you unlike the roborock?)

- Not as nice for homes with carpet(not relevant to me)

- App/support is much worse than Roborock

Is this fairly accurate and do you believe I'd be happy with either models? 

The Omni having a worse app does sound concerning, but honestly, how bad is it?
Is it truly terrible like some people have stated or is it just a bit worse/less polished than Roborocks? 
Does it still have most of the same features?


The fact that the Omni can dry the mopping pads for you seems to be a major advantage there that isn't talked about too much from what I've read.


I can pick up an Omni today at Bestbuy but would have to wait weeks for the Roborock to get here, so that's another minor bonus"
"Vacuum Bot recommendation student householdDear redditors,

can anyone recommend a budget friendly (<500€) vacuum bot? Maybe a model that has been working great in your own household.

We have a 65m^(2) appartment, no pets, girlfriend that tends to lose lots of long hair.

The following aspects are important:

\- reliable

(We thought about getting the Dreame L10s Pro for example but because of the mopping technology there seem to be lots of cases of mop or water tank malfunction, which doesn't make automation a lot of fun)

\- good vacuum performance

\- decent mopping would be neat, but I'd be ok if this is out of our price range

\- station is a nice to have but not necessary.

&#x200B;

Some of our candidates are w10 ,l10s pro, z10 all from dreame. But it doesn't have to be this specifiy brand.

Unfortunately right now the roborock s8 base model is cheaper than the s7 where i live, otherwise I'd go for a s7, but my girlfriend is not happy with the price tag.

&#x200B;

Thanks a ton in advance."
"Got a few candidates for a robot, could you please help me pick one of them?Hi, could you please help me pick a robot? It's supposed to be a gift for my father. 

1. PROSCENIC M6 PRO, price ~ 730 PLN

2. Xiaomi Viomi V2 PRO, price ~ 1080 PLN

3. ILIFE L100, price ~ 1180 PLN

If you have other options I'm all ears, but my budget is limited to about 1000 Polish zloty (~240 American $)."
"Someone here to help wtih my decision?Hi it’s my first time buying a robot vacuum and I’ve been really doing a lot thinking to choose the right one for me.
First of all I live in a 3 bedroom apartment of around 60 square meter (or 650 square feet I guess) with a friend of mine and we both each have our own cat (one is a ragdoll🥲), we have a middle sized carpet in the living room and everywhere else is wood floor.
And we don’t have that many furniture but we have some pet stuff on the floor quite everywhere. Also I’m kinda tired with vacuuming all the kitty litter and fur lying all over the floor while I have to study for a long time during the weekdays.
In this situation I narrowed the candidates down to four ones and I hope anyone could pick the right one for me or maybe rank them. Thanks in advance🙂

1) Shark AI ultra self-empty (Av2511 something model)
This one is currently $300 on Amazon 
And it has all the cutting-edge(?) functions like Lidar mapping, auto emptying, and I heard its basic functions are as nice as others
Alhough I see bad reviews of Shark brand and its apps quite often, I think this one has everything that I need and has the best price.
Finally I also like that it doesnt have a dust bag

2) Dreame Z10 Pro
It has all the functions the first one has and even better, I saw that its obstacle avoiding ability is quite good. But quite more expensive ($480?) and considering customs and shipping costs🤯 since I live outside the US… And although I really like that it has mopping function but I don’t think I’m gonna use it that much… finally I saw some reviews that its basic picking up function could have been better.

3) irobot J7+
Many reviewers compliment this product and I saw that it has very nice obstacle avoiding technology. And I heard irobot’s two brushes thing is quite good at carpet cleaning and hair tangling. It is good in overall and cheaper than other high-end robot vacuums. Yet it’s way over my budget.

4) Eufy L70
It had that Lidar thing and basic functions also seemed to be nice enough. Its only drawback is missing autocleaning function I guess.. Though it also has mop function(which again I don’t really know how often I will use..) and I think cheapest of all these four

So which one of these four do you guys recommend? I’m about to buy Shark one but I would like to consider many things before buying. Thanks for reading a long post!"
"Does a Scoopa replacement robot exist?I've had 3 second-hand Scoobas (380/390) that serve greaty to the mission of keeping our floor clean. I don't regreat buying them, but each lasted only few months. After repairing and replacing several parts they get back to life for few months and then another part needs fixing/replacement.

I guess that evidences why iRobot decided to stop selling them, and I can see how difficult can be to build cleanin robots that mix hydraulics, electronics, pumps, etc.

I also gave a try to several mops (Braava, attached mops to vacuum cleaners, etc) which I don't think are worth. They serve their purpose to do superficial cleaning, but nothing compared to the work that the Scooba perform.

Do you think there is a real candidate that can compete with the old Scoobas? I've seen a similar product( iLife W400) which doesn't get much publicity, and my feeling is that the new iRobot mops wouldn't perform much better than the old Braavas (came from Mint)"
"Shark IQ Self Emptying Vac- AV1010AE or AV1002AE ?I'm currently looking at some Shark IQ models and I'm not sure which one to get. I'm focused on Shark because of the self empty aspect. These are the only models I could find that fit by budget (under 600 CAD on [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca), has to be them because I have a a gift card to use).

I've identified AV1010AE (XL) as the ideal candidate though I'm not sure what's the difference between the AV1010AE  and the AV1002AE aside from the fact that it's not an XL and the AV1002AE seems to come with boundary strips.   
Unless the AV1002AE is also an XL but amazon doesn't have XL in the title?  


These 2 are also in my price range but my understanding is these 2 are older models:  
AV911S EZ  
RV1001AEC

Apartment occupied by 1 person, 600SqFt, no pets. I do have 1 medium pile (8ft \* 9Ft) rug in my living room. 

Should I get the AV1010AE or the AV1002AE ?"

"Help Me Decide: Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni vs. Roborock S7 Maxv UltraHey there, I'm in the market for a robot vacuum and I'm trying to decide between the Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni and the Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra. The Ecovacs is currently on sale for $1640 AUD, while the Roborock is priced at $2499 AUD. I've heard that the Roborock is generally considered to be the better option, but I'm wondering if the price difference is really worth it.

As a first-time robot vacuum buyer, I'm curious to hear from others who have experience with these models. Have you used either of these vacuums before? If so, what do you think of their performance, features, and overall value? And for those who have tried both, do you think the Roborock is worth the extra $859? I'd love to hear any insights or recommendations you have!"
"Help me decide on a robot vacuumI can’t decide between the iRobot s9+ combo with the Braava jet m6 (1399$ on sale now) or the Roborock s8 plus (1700$) with integrated mop.

Which one has a better iPhone app interface?

Please help!!!"
"Help me selecting a robot vacuum, please?As the title states. 

I hate vacuuming, even though I have a small vacuum, dragging it around and not getting well around furniture really irritates me. Also, not getting under the bed, being stuck behind a corner, you get the jist. 

What I want from a robot vacuum is not much, it has to be able to get around my apartment and it has to be able to SEE where it's going, not BUMPING like it's a moron, doing the same square 5 times. 

In that aspect, mapping my apartment floor with no go zones (around my coffee tables and my nightstand) would be 10000% a must have feature. 

A bonus could be a waste bin and mopping feature. 

In the vast amount that is available, I have no clue where to look. 

I tried one before, but it was a bumping vacuum and it couldn't make sense of the room, and it wasn't bright enough to go around my coffee tables. 

I'm willing to spend 250-550 euros. I might be able to stretch it to 600. I don't need a high end model, just a smarter one than a bumping vacuum.

I've looked at a few, but I just can't make up the difference between brands. 

If it helps, I'm situated in the Netherlands. Maybe someone has ideas. 

Thanks in advance, also for reading this wall of text.

"[HELP] iRobot robot 960 can’t go back to its dock on its own.Hi all,

I have this iRobot since Dec 2019 and for a while now it just struggles to go back to its dock, it keeps going out, spinning around moving the dock and then gives up when it’s out of battery. Even if I put it back manually sometimes I have to fiddle with it for 30 seconds to make it stay on the dock. Irritating. I never want to use the thing. 

I’ve also noticed recently a lot of the dust gets brushed underneath to only the left side of the robot sensor which does touch the dock.

I’d like to point out that I have thoroughly cleaned all sensors (dock included)…

Do I need a new one? Has she seen her best life after nearly four years?"
"Please help choosing between Roborock Q5+, Roomba J7, or .........Hey guys. I've researched more than I'd like to admit and still confused on what to get. My house is 60% hard floor, 40% carpet. Own 1 small dog. (never poops/pees in house. Just sheds a little)

Features I'd like to have:

1. Be able to spot clean a section of the house from the app. For example, if kitchen bar needs clean, I can spot clean a specific part of the map from the app.
2. robot avoid objects in floor. IE underwear/clothes, shoes, etc. Also want to identify on the map areas that robot can't go/bump into.
3. auto dispose bin would be great but not absolutely essential.
4. built to last. They are expensive and I expect it to last 10 years+. Only plan to buy extra brushes and battery replacement etc. down the line.

Roomba J7 pros:

1. better carpet cleaning, object detection for small objects like cords. Apparently roborock isn't as good as J7 bc it doesn't have camera. Easier to get replacement parts?

Roomba cons:

1. for price of q5+, doesn't have feature #3. Supposedly still has horrible mapping (bumps into objects all the time like the old school roomba did/do?). Doesn't use lidar.

Roborock Q5+ pros:

1. better mapping, more features. value for price (feature #3)

Robo cons:

1. doesn't clean carpet as good due to dual brush.

&#x200B;

I'm leaning towards the roborock. Seems like most people agree it's significantly better overall. I think the only reason I'd go roomba is for better carpet clean and maybe easier to get parts down the road. I'm torn and would love some help.

I've also looked at  Dreametech D10 Plus,  Shark - AI,  ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T10+. None of them seem to be as good as name brand roomba or roborock. I'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks!"

"Need help troubleshooting my Eufy 11sMy Eufy 11S recently started moving way more quickly and erratically, and it will also stop after running for about ten seconds. It does one beep with a non-flashing light, which, according to the manual, means that one of the wheels is stuck. I don't see any major obstructions around the wheels; I  also unscrewed the plates around the wheels and brushed out any dust. This made zero difference. 

Other things I've done:

* Cleaned out hair that was wrapped around the swivel wheel
* Cleaned the rolling brush
* Wiped the sensors with a dry cloth
* Beat the dust out of the filters (which are still fairly new)

Anything I'm missing? I've read some reviews that these models aren't built to last (I've had mine for about 16 months), but I'm really hoping there's something I can do to fix mine."
"What to choose? Please help a robot newbie!Tl Dr - what is a good robot vacuum/mop hybrid, that:
is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"
"Need Help SelectingLooking for recommendations in a robotic vacuum that would best suit our needs. 

Home is single story, 1500 square feet. One pet that sheds a lot. Laminate throughout, with a couple rug runners. The laminate has been discontinued, so we live in fear of water penetrating it, it then bubbling, and having to replace the entire flooring in the home. Hence, I don’t think we really want a robot with a mopping feature; sounds like too much risk for water penetration. 

We currently have a Roomba 860 and don’t love it.  It’s dumb, scuffs the baseboards, gets stuck, needs constant emptying, doesn’t return to the dock, and is pretty underwhelming power wise. We’d spend as much as necessary for a reliable new vacuum. Any helpful suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as I’m about 20+ hours into reading reviews and still feel lost as to what is right for our situation."

"Shark AI RV2520A0US Front Wheel Assembly HelpI have two of these. One of them the wheel keeps popping out of the housing because it appears to have been worn out somewhat (so the wheel can just about fall out).  I have scoured the internet on how to replace the wheel assemble in whole and most instructions instruct you to remove the two screws that are in the white plastic area.  One website mentioned the screws are a TR9 Torx.  I went out and bought a kit that included Torx bits so I can remove this and it wouldn't do anything.  I zoomed in with the camera on my phone and I am not even sure this is a screw of any sort.  Almost looks like a rivet.  I did not strip it out in case anyone is wondering.  Both of my vacuums seem to have the same exact scenario.  Has anyone ever removed the wheel housing on this model?  Thanks!

"Somebody asked why I test all the robot vacuums in ""real life"", too and don't just rely on some kind of a lab test results. This is why.&#x200B;

[Stuck robots over the years](https://preview.redd.it/w8ksx7won0f81.jpg?width=1608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=754f36e9fe290a7ab9a7ec6913240f23039e117d)

I simply want to find a robovac that can be sent to work. Robot that doesn't need any human intervention whatsoever, no need to take out rugs, draw no-go zones or to physically remove obstacles. Basically: tools that do their job automatically, in any condition. 

Luckily, we're getting there with the latest breed to obstacle-avoiding robot vacuums."
"Roborock S8 Pro Ultra ReviewI absolutely love my new S8 Pro Ultra.  I owned a horrible Roomba 20 years ago and I feel like I have gone from an iPhone 1 to iPhone 15.  I have a large 2 level house with beagles, different floor types and have a unit servicing each floor.  I plan to run them 2-3x week and be meticulous on the maintenance.  Now only time will tell if the units stay healthy.  Side topic - Anyone else thinks the OMO cleaner smells like blueberry pancakes after a room is mopped? 

Pros: 
- All the automation is seamless and no issues.  The unit just works as advertised with no intervention.  

- The App is very well constructed, great response and easy to use.  I love I can set no go zones and avoid the robot from getting stuck.  

- Vac is very good.  

- Moping is excellent.  Looks like I did it myself.  

- Siri control is awesome for adhoc single room cleaning.  I can rely on the reoccurring schedule while also calling the robot to a specific room if a mess is made.  

- Room mapping is accurate and fast 

- Avoidance is decent.  Not perfect but the unit does navigate well and does a good job of getting out of tight spots

- No issues with onboard bin transfer to the dock bin.  Our dogs shed a ton and so far no blockage.  

Cons:
- (This is more for myself and not the unit) I use a nice reverse osmosis, 4 stage water filtration to supply filtered water.  It’s faster than a distilled machine and can produce 1700ml in about 8mins.  But I do have to spend some time each week refilling the main jug.  

- As said the avoidance is decent.  I would not rely on this unit to avoid poop messes 100% of the time.  But my dogs are grown and trained so I don’t have in house mess issues.  

- I can already tell customer service is going to be a challenge.  On launch they didn’t have any S8 specified bin bags listed on the Roborock site.  The chat tech kept telling me they were not avail despite me asking several times if the S7 bin bags were identical.  Turns out they are identical and they updated their site a week later specifying the S8 also.  I have heard mixed reviews on the China support.  

- Maintenance.  As said a I plan to be meticulous here.  Seems like a full maintenance scrub will be needed monthly for all the various systems.  But this is a minor inconvenience for the automated clean floors.

- Rug/Hardwood Edge mopping is not great because of the lifted mop when transition to carpet.  Which is actually a good thing to not dampen the rugs but the edge mopping is sloppy because of this."
"Are i-robot brand vacuums in general better, or is it mostly Tesla/Apple style hype?I'm just dipping my toes in to this. I kind of want to get a robot vacuum but looking in to it is such a boring chore that it's almost as bad as vacuuming itself. The easy go-to choice for someone with as short an attention span as me is an i-robot vacuum, simply because for decades now their 'roomba' brand has become almost a generic term and they're just by far the most well known.

They also seem to often be the most expensive making them in my mind, the Apple of robot vacuums. That also makes me wonder if there's a decent chance that they don't justify their price tag and simply rely on the brand name associations to keep people paying. But if they really are good, then it would be nice shortcut for me to avoid having to read so many reviews and advertising and a lot of 'reviews' that are advertising because I can maybe restrict my search parameters to mostly irobot or mostly irobot and one or two other well known brands."
"Can LiDAR vacuum bots see through bedspreads?I a number of beds with bedspreads or whatever you call the thing that hangs down from the mattress to the floor.  I have a “dumb” Shark robot vacuum that happily goes through them. 

Will the newer models that use LiDAR go under the bed?"
"Relocating the auto empty dock in a 2-level houseI am currently researching various different brands and models of robot vacuum cleaners which have the auto empty dock feature.

These are the ones I am interested in:
- Rockrock S7 Maxv
- Dreame L10S Ultra

After doing the research, in particular YouTube video reviews, there is one scenario which I have not scene or mentioned in any of the reviews.

Since I have a two-story house, I'm intending to map both levels and I want the robot vacuum cleaner to operate on both levels.

I understand the robot vacuum will need to be lifted and carried to the upper level as obviously it cannot climb a staircase.

After allowing the robot to map both levels in the house, before cleaning operation starts I'm intending to relocate the docking station to the level which I intend to clean. I may do this several times per week.

Note: The need to relocate the auto empty dock to the upper level during a clean would be particularly necessary if I was to purchase the ""Dreame L10S Ultra"", as this particular model relies on the auto empty dock to clean its mopping pads several times during a mopping job. In fact it can be configured to clean after every 10 m² of mopping, which is a pretty good feature in my opinion.

1. Will relocating the dock confuse the robot in any way? 
2. Will it invalidate the mapping?"
"Bissell A3 is almost 1/2 off, I bought one here are my thoughts.As of right now the ready clean mop head changing system is just $350.The TLDR is; I am extremely impressed and, this will replace my Roomba M6 .

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"
"Problem with Roidmi EvaHi,

I‘ve bought a new Roidmi Eva. I’m very happy with the vacuuming and mopping, it’s doing a great job. but I’m having a major issue and don’t know how to solve it.

Let’s say the door to the hallway is closed and he is cleaning another room and scans alongside, he now thinks that there’s a wall to the hallway. When I now want to clean the hallway, he says that he can’t access it. He doesn’t even start to scan if there’s a way, he just say no and don’t start. That’s super frustrating. 

The only way I see is to send him first to another room so he sees that the door is open now. 
But that’s not how I thought the robot will work. I want to chose the room and then rely that he will clean it.

Is there anything I can do about this problem? 

Thank you!"
"iRobot j7+ review video + write up [OC]Hey everyone, we're a little late on this one, but we've finally released our review of the J7+. Check it out on Youtube here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFuuRpJQaic&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFuuRpJQaic&)

There are a few things of interest about this robot to me, in particular.

\- I believe that they're relying more and more on the optical floor tracking sensor - the one used on the i3, more than the front facing camera.  As a result, it's a little more clumsy to watch than other options and takes a few full cycles to create its map.

\- Once again, iRobot haven't increased the suction power so it's now quite far behind some competitors.  They haven't published a suction figure, but I believe it's around 1800pa.  Despite this, it's probably still the best or thereabouts on carpet due to the signature dual-roller set-up.  The dual rollers don't make quite as much difference on hard floors or with bigger items like leaves, but the suction is still sufficient.

\- The vSLAM camera is now mounted on the front of the robot and looks forward, rather than at the ceiling.  As a result, the J7 is the first iRobot to have object detection for things lying on the ground.  It was pretty good - it missed all our dog poo tests and while it caught some cables, it didn't actually get stuck.  Only criticism is that in some cases it was slightly too sensitive and avoided some spots it shouldn't have, but that won't really matter if you're using it regularly and is a fairly common issue with object detection.

\- The new design and base is very cool.  The base is a lot smaller than any of its competitors and is a much better use of space.

Feel free to ask any questions... I'd love if you asked them on Youtube rather than here to help the algorithm ;) I only check the comments here every few days but I'll try answer any questions.

Currently working on our S7 MaxV Ultra review... expect that within the next week or so."
"Vacuum - with best obstacle avoidanceI see the new models come with some ability to avoid obstacles, but I have yet to see one that does it so efficiently that you can rely on it to do a room without getting stuck 9/10 times, with the exception of maybe the new iRobot (forgot the model name), but it had some other downsides that potentially was a dealbreaker for me. Have been holding off for a while in anticipation of these models (got an S5 Max), are there any new models around the block that are expected to be able to do this feature quite well? The current new xiaomi models seem to still be struggling a bit. Any input is appreciated!"
"Dreame Z10 Pro Robot Vacuum and Mop with DockHave you been spending hours and hours reviewing the same robot vacuums over and over to see which one you would like to spend your hard earned money on? Have you still not come to a conclusion yet? Well, I’ll come to that conclusion so you don’t have to!
Enough of the rhetoric, I cannot repeat this enough, but this wonderful machine has changed my life and in this review you’ll see how it can change yours too.

Firstly, I have to note that I have been sent this robot vacuum by Dreame, although I have been told that I can be honest in my review, as they care about the customer feedback and want to make the best possible products on the market.
Furthermore, I am going to write a small bit about me so you can understand the struggles I have with hoovering. I am 21, partially blind, I have psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Aspergers. I have been looking for months upon months, to try and find the best robot vacuum for the price. I cannot see small crumbs an dog hair on the floor so I get incredibly frustrated when it comes to hoovering up because I often miss a lot of debris on the floor and my mum, who works full-time, takes it upon herself to help me do it, and as much as I love my mother, I don’t want to rely on her in that way and I don’t want to take up anymore of her precious time. This is where the good bit comes, I have been eyeballing Dreame’s products for a while and luckily for me, they sent one out to me to show the world that if you struggle like me, this is the perfect robot vacuum for you, whether you have disabilities or just want that added comfort of not having to do the hoovering in your house, because this robot can do it all! 

Upon receiving this product, I noticed that the materials used and the packaging provided was incredibly well put together. I took out the beast-of-a-hoover and right then and there I knew I was going to enjoy hoovering for once. All that you need to do, when taking the hoover out of the box is put in the little spinning brush, it click in with ease and trust me if I can do it, then you can too. 
The product I received came with the docking station, and my oh my it is a wonderful contraption at that, I’ll come back to that a little later. After the small assembly, all I had to do was plug in the dock, ‘press the return to dock’ button on the hoover itself and off it went and rolled up the dock and started charging itself!

I will be honest, I’m currently in a homeless hostel waiting to get my own place, so I am unable to talk about the Wi-Fi connectivity and the app in thorough detail. However, I had a little look and it seems very easy and simple to navigate, with zones you can set for the hoover to avoid, and detailed maps that you can label, so in future you could probably say ‘Alexa hoover kitchen’ lets say and it’ll go and do it for you. There is other benefits of the app I’m sure, but like me, you don’t even have to use the app, all I do right now is press the power button, take the dog for a walk and I return to a lovely, freshly hoovered flat. This is all done through the Xiaomi Home app, which if you don’t know, is an extremely useful app for other devices, such as Xiaomi scooters and other utilities that use the same app. If I’m not mistaken, you can also have up to 3 floor plans on the app as well, so you can take it upstairs and allow it to hoover, its not heavy at all either so don’t worry about pulling your lower back out. 



This bot is one of very few that used LIDAR as well as vSLAM, which in basic terms means that it uses both cameras and sensors, as well as lasers to gather insightful information such as detailed mapping of a room, as well as which obstacles to avoid. It is honestly a sight to behold, especially when you see it avoid something such as the dog  or a dog toy, and it does this all in real-time, it’ll have the maps taken beforehand as a template, but it’ll detect objects on the fly, and this is what makes this product so magnificent. This pinpoint-precision tech tells the hoover where to hoover and what lines to take in order to most efficiently and effectively vacuum. The suction is powerful, it cleans my carpets perfectly and gets those little crumbs, dirt that I can’t see, and even flakes of skin that shed due to my psoriasis too! Effectively the Dreame z10 pro has changed my life for the better.

One important thing to know,  is that this hoover is pretty good with dog hair, I have a Shiba Inu, which sheds a whole lot, and the hoover manages hair quite well, although after a month, you do have to detangle those stray hairs, but Dreame has thought of this and has provided a little detangling/brush tool underneath the back lid of the hoover itself. Furthermore, this little hoover gets into spots that some people with mobility problems will struggle to get into, such as under beds, sofas and tables, getting into those awkward spots so you don’t have to, saving your back in the mean time!

Now, onto the meat and potatoes of this product and why it stands out. The dock. Each bag lasts 60 days, I was given 2, though I think I read somewhere that you get 5, the bags will be available on amazon, and so far I’ve nearly reached 2 months and I still have room to spare, I usually hoover every day. Enough about the bags, onto the dock itself and believe me, you’ll want to purchase this hoover with the dock, it just makes sense! When the hoover has detected that its compartment is full, it goes and empties itself into the dock and then comes back and finishes where it left off, with no guidance or input needed at all and it just looks astounding, almost like a piece of art. If, you don’t buy the hoover with the dock, you’ll have to empty the hoover into a bin yourself and that’s quite arduous and finicky if you ask me, I don’t even know how you’ll charge the hoover without the dock. The obstacle avoidance is really good, it avoids dog toys and even wires, though sometimes it can go over smaller wires, but I’ve never seen wires wrap around the brush roller, so i believe there is a sensor next to the roller itself that detects wires and stops before it sucks them in.

Lastly, the mop is very good, I have a small kitchen and it does the job noticeably well. However, you have to keep taking the mop off and on as and when you want to mop, and in my case, if you’re using the reusable mop, you have to clean it every time, because it is that effective at mopping that it just gets full with dirt after one use. One improvement that could be made, is an automatic lifting device for the mop, so you don’t have to take it off when hoovering over carpets, it detects a carpet and a little motor lifts the whole mop up so your carpet doesn’t get wet, I’ve seen it implemented elsewhere, but paying nearly twice the price for a little lifting device for the mop isn’t worth it. One other small gripe I’d say, is that maybe Dreame could make a bag-less version in the future, so you can just empty the bin and not have to fuss around replacing bags every 2 months, and I would hope that these bags are bio-degradable. However, I’m being very nit-picky and it was very hard to find downfalls in this device, as it is very useful and life-changing for me especially. 

In conclusion, I believe that right now, for the money, this is the best hoover on the market, with the features you get. Even at full price this is a steal, but right now there is a limited early-bird price so definitely check around to see that price. If you’re someone with disabilities or limited mobility then you will greatly benefit from having the Z10, even if you have no disabilities and just want the added ease of coming back from work after a hard day, going on the app and telling your hoover to clean, you’ll come back to a nice hoovered home, which in turn means less stress for you, and to me, that is priceless. I am so thankful that Dreame has bestowed upon me this magnificent product and I hope that many of you enjoy it as much as I have, and that my review helps guide you into knowing which robot vacuum to buy, it is definitely worth it. This is a step into the future, that of autonomy and I’m happy to be a part of it. Dreame is a very forward thinking company and wants to help make peoples lives better as well as easier and I personally look forward to what they have to offer in the future, and you should too, so keep an eye out! I also love how Dreame values the customer, they listen to feedback and want to make the best products based on what the customer wants, and that is so valuable to me and all companies should be like that, I’m very thankful to Dreame for giving me this opportunity, and I hope that my review is appreciated.

"Warning: Samsung is deleting negative reviews from their website + YSK/LPT on how to potentially get a full refund within 7 years if a California buyerHi r/RobotVacuum,

I bought a Samsung R7070 vacuum about 4 years ago. The battery has nearly run it's full life, however a replacement is not available from any retailer I can find. Their authorized parts distributor does not list the part and has not responded to queries about it. Samsung support couldn't help either, though they claim that I could send it in to get repaired for $199 (despite the fact that this was advertised as a user-replaceable part).

First a warning:

I posted the following review on the Samsung website:

>I purchased this in December 2017. running time is now about 15 minutes in medium mode, well less than the advertised 30 minutes. No replacement batteries are available from any source, including Samsung's official channels. The battery is advertised as a user-replaceable part and they show it as an accessory one can purchase, but it is not sold separately. They want $199 to replace the battery at their service depot. Further, they claim this is a ""fur/hair friendly"" vacuum but the ""blades"" inside the vacuum do nothing to stop hair from building up. The roller needs frequent cleaning and i don't even own a pet. I feel totally defrauded by samsung and will never—ever—buy another samsung product after this experience. ​forget that... Buyer beware!!

**Samsung deleted the review saying it didn't meet their guidelines.** I guess they don't like it when people post critical reviews? So, don't rely on reviews on [Samsung.com](https://Samsung.com) as they are unlikely to accurately reflect the problems with their products.

The YSK/LPT for Californians: ""[Under California’s Lemon Law, manufacturers of most household electronic goods that sell for more than $100 have to provide spare parts for up to seven years, regardless of warranty status.](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20151211-column.html)"" So, if you buy a Samsung vacuum, or any other product over $100, they have to make spare parts available to you. If they do not have the parts, they must repurchase it from you for the price they paid for it.

I had a Samsung monitor fail and Samsung eventually did purchase it back from me. I will see if this approach works with Samsung on this particular issue.

In the meantime, good luck out there!

Update: I was able to find a replacement part, no thanks to Samsung or their only authorized parts dealer. The part number listed on the Samsung website is wrong, and the real part was replaced with a new part number."
"Shark IQ replacement unitWe had an unfortunate Shark poop incident today.  Instead of trying to clean it, I’m tossing the unit.  We’ve only had it since Xmas and use it daily.  Was our first robot vacuum and had few complaints in the short time it was around! 

2x questions 

#1 - we have the below Shark IQ with self emptying base.  Can I buy another of just the exact shark unit to dock with this base (presumably saving money and not having to rebuy the whole thing)?

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S864GPW/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glt_fabc_G7KYNNENCYQKYZK551PM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

#2 - should we upgrade?  We have a 2 story & split level home (4 different levels total) so I was never relying on the Shark’s mapping and just manually moving it to various levels (outside of the main one it was on) and letting it do it’s thing without a solid map.  

But because of this sub I’ve read about the DeeBot OZMO T8.  Our home is mainly hardwood with tile kitchen, though not sure we need it mopped constantly.  And we have a number of floor rugs/carpets through.  Is the Multi Level mapping successful?  Is the mopping easily toggled off?  

It appears that specific unit would require a separate emptying base purchase, so it would be pretty pricy.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!"
"Bought Shark ai Robot Vacmop - a bit disappointedThe main thing I am disappointed about is the mapping and detection. It could be 1-5 feet away from the homebase dock and not be able to find it when I press the DOCK button. It will go all the way around the house before it docks. I've had it for a day and have tried to dock 4 times and it's only made it back one time without help.  It seems very random and relies very heavily on the sensor rather than the memory of what it mapped. And even with that it is very random in how it chooses it's path. Does any have the same experience and maybe a remedy for it?  Or should I return it for something in the same price range that is actually ""smart"" lol."
"Dreame vs Deebot - trustworthiness/reliability?Hi! I'm deciding between the Dreame z10 pro and Deebot N8 pro plus.

I've poured over the specs and (early) reviews and am still not sure which is the best value. I'm willing to pay double for the N8 pro if it's of much higher quality, but I'd love some insight on either company/product:

* Reliability over time - once that 1 year warranty has expired, how long can I expect the product to last?
* Customer support - how easily I be able to get help if I run into problems?
* Warranty coverage (in Canada) - if something breaks, is it going to cost me $300 to ship it back for a ""free"" replacement?

*Open to other suggestions.. I have all hardwood floors. My top feature priorities are stellar object detection (needs to avoid charging cables, cat vomit, etc), mopping, and auto empty bin.*"
"Magnetized Boundry Tape For Lefant M213I bought a roll of magnetized tape to block off a doorway. The vacuum just rolls right over it.

Is there a tape that anyone knows actually works for this robot? I don't want to keep spending money on stuff that doesn't work.

This is the tape I bought. Unfortunately, yesterday wasthe last day to return it. I didn't get to test it until today because of work and my mother being hospitalized.

"carpet deep cleaning tests inconsistent?I'm trying to choose a robovac for a mostly carpeted apartment, and I was looking at videos on youtube comparing carpet cleaning results. And I was surprised how vastly different the rankings were on the same type of test (deep carpet cleaning)!

For example, in [this video](https://youtu.be/lRZLcft2PBc?t=81) roombas totally dominate everything else with giant margins, but [here](https://youtu.be/WtScRB2yaYg?t=105) roombas are in the middle.

What do you think explains the inconsistency and what have you found to be the most trustworthy sources of experimental data?"
Is the fancy roborock honestly worth it?
"Why it is not recommended to put the dock under something?Honestly I don't want a robot vac sitting at the centre of my living room and I don't want to see it all the time.

Thinking about keeping it under the bed. But the user manual says you should not put it under a furniture etc. Why is that? Is it causing some problem? What happens if I put the dock under the bed?"
"Roborock S6 Pure vs S6 MaxV?Hey Reddit,

I've been thinking of getting a robot vacuum, but the amount of options is overwhelming. After finally settling on Roborock, I now need to choose a modell. The S6 Pure and S6 MaxV seem to be good options.

It would need to clean about 100 square meters of space, deal with my long hair and be pet friendly, since I have two dogs. Because of the later fact, I'm leaning closer towards the MaxV, because of the object avoidence feature, but is a lot more expensive (And, quite honestly, more than I want to spend on a vacuum, that still requires manuell help).

Mopping isn't a priority at all. I've heard it's not the best feature in those vacuums anyway.


Do you have any experience with either vacuums especially in relation to pets?

Edit: Bought the cheaper S6 Pure an couldn't be happier. This thing is amazing! The vacuum cleaner and dog get along as well :)"
"Looking for recommendations in USASo I bought a Eufy q32 pro on clearance, and I love this thing, it's my first robotic vacuum, that said, it's bullying my recliner relentlessly and keeps getting stuck under it. I don't really need one that mops, but I have a lot of carpet and I shed relentlessly (with hair that's about 3-4ft long) While not necessarily on a budget, I don't see myself needing the Roborock S7 MaxV. I was kinda looking at the Q5+ or the Roomba J7+ but honestly I'm very new to the robot vacuum scene, so I thought I'd come ask people that are far more knowledgeable than I am :)"
"Roborock S7 Plus, but which one?I've been meaning to get the Roborock S7 Plus for some time. However, where I live, it currently seems to be almost exclusively available in white which has made me second-guess because I'm worried that with such a light color, it will end up constantly looking dirty. Otoh, I've seen a video in which a black S7 had a lot of what appeared to be scratches or smears on the sides, which was looking just gnarly, so I'm wondering if maybe white is the superior color after all.

&#x200B;

Researching further, I found that the S7 MaxV Plus could be a good alternative (which would also be more easily available in black), especially because it's supposed to be better at recognizing obstacles, but I'm not sure if this is worth the higher price.

&#x200B;

I was thinking that if I'm getting the S7 MaxV, I could just as well go all-in and get the S7 MaxV Ultra as, honestly, I can see myself not wanting to use the mop function a lot due to not wanting to deal with the cloth after each run. But at that point, it really has to be worth it because the price is way higher than what I originally wanted to spend, and there seem to be some drawbacks.

I've seen a video in which a guy was pointing out that you'll regularly need to clean the station which seems a lot nastier and time-consuming than changing the cloth. 

I only have two smaller rooms that need regular mopping, so I assume that I'll only need to change the cloth after each run, and not mid-run.

Do I assume correctly that the Ultra station also dries the cloth? So that the vac can sit in the station with the cloth on for a couple of days after a mopping run? Or would I also need to remove the cloth after each run?

Having to use dust bags is a drawback as well, but I think I can deal with that better than with with a mop-cleaning function that, in the worst case, gives me more work than a station without.

"Companion for Roomba 960I have a 960 which is 4 years old, it does still a great job.
Now I would like to buy a second one for the second floor of the house
I would like to stick with iRobot (maybe i3, there is no lots of obstacle to run around, just beds and so on), or take another one?
I like the fact to have everything inside the same app to be honest, but if there is something cheaper which does the same job, then is ok."
"Best Mid-Range option?Hi all,

Wanting to get my first robovac, and feeling pretty confused, so I have a few questions I was hoping you could help with:

1. Is it worth spending more? Will a £1000 guy really do that much better than the £500 guy?


2. Is it worth getting a self empty station?


3. What is the best mid-range?
Amazon has a few self empty options that seem decent, but I honestly have no clue:

Laresar L6 Pro


Dreame D10 plus

For context: Multi-level home, mostly carpets, no pets (though my wife seems to shed enough to cover that)

Thank you!"
"Shark AI Ultra wit Lidar has terrible object avoidanceIt keeps trying to climb these stool pedestals and gets stuck. Honestly not sure how it can’t see them with LIDAR because the pedestals are fairly large. 

On top of that, the app is terrible and creating rooms is buggy.

Definitely do not recommend this robot."
"Buying my very first robot vacuum and I need some help!Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some real help from some real people. 

TL;DR (I’m putting this here for those who don’t want to read the entire long post): I’m trying to choose a robot vacuum from Amazon, it must be able to pick up human hair and dog fur from tile floors. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so I have never owned a robot vacuum before but I have wanted one for a long, long time. Now that Amazon is having a sale and I have about $300 in amazon credit, this seems like the best time to get one. Only problem is there are so many options and I have been sitting here reading reviews for hours and I can’t decide because of course the reviews are all conflicting and confusing. I think I’ve narrowed it down to two but I am open to any other suggestions if there’s something you think is better (I do have some wiggle room on the price, as I’d like one that will work and also last). So here’s what I’m looking at now:

1. Roomba i4 + EVO ($400 with prime deal & comes with a free 3rd gen echo dot / listed price $667.98)
2. Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL ($400 / list price $600)

I live in a 2 bdrm/2bath apartment, approximately 1000sq ft. I’m a single parent with a teenager and a fluffy little yorkie mix. We all shed. Between the 3 of us, we shed a lot! There is always hair and fur everywhere. I hate vacuuming and you know the teen won’t do it so I think it would be nice to have one of these around to help me out a bit. We are quite messy, which is also part of why I put off buying one of these for so long but I’m hoping that having this will motivate us to pick up our shoes/clothes/etc off the floor. I’m tired of living in an apartment full of clutter and hair/fur. Would be great to be able to walk around barefoot in my house. I have a bona for washing the floors but it doesn’t work as well when there’s hair everywhere! Oh almost forgot to add, our apartment is all tile, no carpet or rugs.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is that it can handle picking up all the hair and fur without clogging up or anything. Ill be honest, I am not at all familiar with the Shark brand. I’ve wanted a Roomba forever but I think it’s just because it’s the one I’ve heard the most about. But I’m not going to make a choice based on name recognition alone. For all I know, the Shark is just as good or even better than the Roomba. One thing that makes me lean more towards the Shark is that it’s bagless and the Roomba bags are costly. On Amazon, I found a package of 3 replacement bags for $20 and another package with all the other replacement parts for $55. I could not find the Shark replacement filters on Amazon or even by googling it so idk the cost of those; all I found were off brand replacement parts that claim to fit but have mixed reviews on whether they actually do. Also, I’m not sure if it’s safe to use off brand replacement parts. But im clueless about this so if people who know more about it tell me it’s fine then I’m fine with it. I just worry if something goes wrong with a bad part then it will break the vacuum. Regardless, I won’t need to buy bags for the Shark so I assume it will cost less as far as replacements go. Other than that, both of these seem pretty good.

Of course, both have pros and cons. Also, both have an average of 4.3 stars on Amazon. I really just can’t read any more reviews or my head will explode. I don’t know if I can trust random websites who get a percent of every sale; I feel like this just incentives them to try to sell you on a more expensive product rather than what’s really best for you. And I honesty can’t tell what is going on with amazon reviews. I saw several reviews that made no sense. Someone actually wrote “I love it, but it leaves behind clumps of hair” (and many others are very similar to this, with 5 stars but a lot of negative stuff in the actual review). I don’t understand it… why do you love it if it isn’t doing its job? What do you love about it? Are you even a real person? Did someone pay you to put 5 stars but they don’t care what you actually write in the body of the review? I feel like either I’m going crazy or the world is or possibly both. 

So yeah, I need help. I hope there are people here who can help me. I really appreciate any and all information, suggestions, etc. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. You are true heroes!"
"Proscenic M7 Pro reviewThis sub was super handy while I was diving deep into the rabbit hole of robot vacuum research, so I thought I would share a review of the one I bought since I couldn't find many that didn't seem like a paid review. The M7 has been discontinued as the M8 has just come out; I picked it up for about 220€ on sale a few months ago.

I'm overall very pleased with my purchase. It's reduced my regular vacuuming significantly and has made such a big difference in the amount of dog hair floating around my apartment. It does need a bit of supervision but it's very manageable. Details below!

Pros:

* Mapping. It's my first robot vac with this function so I may be easily impressed, but I'm thrilled with it. It made a map of my whole apartment, and I can set up zones and tell it to clean one place or room at a time. It doesn't go where I tell it not to go. It's luxury!
* It climbs over small obstacles. This was important to me because I have furniture with bench legs that are about 1-1.5 cm high and round, and it climbs over them easily.
* 2700 Pa of suction on powerful mode. From what I understand, this is bit higher than average at this price point, which is why I picked it because I have a big dog with short, stiff hair and a few flat-weave synthetic rugs. It's AMAZING at pulling up the dog hair on both the hardwood AND the rugs. I've been pleased and surprised by this. It's also pretty good at getting into corners and such.
* Option to buy a self-emptying station for about 100€ extra. Another reason I picked it thinking I might add it on later, but honestly the dust bin is so easy to take out and clean I probably won't bother.
* Gets itself unstuck very well. I almost never have to intervene when it's cleaning, I just put it on and don't think about it, which is also luxury. When there is an issue it will tell you exactly what is wrong (it talks to you, which I think is hilarious).
* It mops surprisingly well, and you can add a bit of floor cleaner to the tank. I wasn't expecting anything from the mopping when I bought it, but it's actually good, and easy to clean the mop cloth. It came with some disposable pads but I've yet to figure out how to use them haha.
* The build feels pretty solid, all the attachments are easy to put on and take off without flipping the vacuum over like I had to do with my old, dumb robot vac. It's also really easy to remove the main brush/rubber flap thing for cleaning.

Cons:

* It's pretty loud. Nowhere near my regular vacuum but still quite loud. The suction is loud, and it navigates by laser and with a front bumper so it's also loud bumping into walls and such as it goes.
* It climbs rather aggressively, which is great for the bench legs on my couch but it will sometimes try to climb the transition into my kitchen which is at least 3cm and it gets itself stuck halfway up. I have a table with bench legs about 2cm high and it also climbs but gets stuck. And it's super loud trying to get itself unstuck until it gives up and pings you to come fix it. It's loud when it's climbing even successfully, actually.
* It only has one mopping function and you can't set up zones and tell it to mop only one room like you can with vacuuming.
* The water tank for mopping is pretty small; it takes about 1.5 tanks for my 60m2 apartment.
* You can only set up a max of 5 restricted zones.
* Maybe 5% of the time it gets a little lost i.e. can't find it's way home, or gets confused by obstacles that are too close together and can't get around them even if there is enough room.
* The app is not terribly intuitive, and it can be a bit buggy, especially when setting up zones. If you're a Luddite, don't buy this vac, but if you're reading this on reddit you probably aren't."
"RoboGem ArleneDoes anyone have an honest review on this brand and model? I'm struggling to find video reviews on this specific vacuum. One has been ordered for me as a gift and I'd like some more insight on common issues to look out for. We have 4 cats and 2 ferrets so the main thing is - will it pick up their fluff?

UPDATE JAN 2023: 
Hey guys, update on RoboGem Arlene who we've affectionately renamed Meryl Sweep. I got Meryl in October last year and I cannot stress how much this thing has changed my life. It runs with no issues using the Tuya smart home app. Seriously zero regrets on this machine. Pet hair, dust and other dander is a thing of the past. Great suction on the vac setting and the mopping function is really good even on hardwood floors because you can set how much water you want to use. Obviously it won't do well on heavily soiled floors but your everyday quick mop is taken care of. The only minor problem I have is that I accidentally broke one of the little clips that clips on the vac container, but other than that it still works perfectly."
No wifi robotDoes anyone know of a robot vacuum maybe a mop one to that doesn't use Wi-Fi. I've always wanted a robot vacuum but my partners worried about selling data. I'm really not but I get it. I have a really fluffy cute kitty so hopefully one that's good with pet hair would be nice but. Honestly at this point I just want to see my cat ride it.
"Shark AI mopvac feedback?Just ordered a shark mopvac (RV2001WDCA). Reviews online are critical so I'm on the fence.

Anyone own this model?"
"Suggestions for a robo vac that can traverse floor transitions?I live in a 1900 sq foot apartment, our flooring is laminate wood and tile, we have some cheap bobsweep vacuum that cant actually get over the faux wood strips that are in the door jamb which serve as transitions between the different flooring types. Any suggestions on a robovac with better ""climbing"" abilities? transition strips are probably 1/2"" tall and 1"" at the widest. 

To be honest, not sure what other features to really look for, just a simple but dependable vac that can roam around the house, no pets or children if that helps, budget of 500-600 CAD would be ideal."
"Self emptying recommendations?I'm looking for a good, cheap (under $300, preferably) that has good enough avoidance, I'm trying to have it suck up socks or yank power cords with it's wheels. I've given up so thoroughly on my shark VACMOP ion whatever that stupid name is that it's going to become a new tannnerite target, so I'm avoiding shark products all together. I don't care about the robustness of of any apps, honestly the simpler the better, the only things I'm looking for are the two things mentioned above."
"UK options? also worth buying one used?Hey folks so finally caving and grabbing a robot vacuum to help out around the downstairs. All hard floors, living, kitchen and dining room. Kitchen is a dark grey. 2 adults, dog and chinchillas. So any suggestions? Trying to keep it under £200 really unless spending more is going to be a God send. Looked on vacuum wars and whilst solid a lot of recommendations that are hard find honestly in the UK it seems and budget picks are still £600 at times. Then anyone had luck buying one on Facebook, ebay, etc? Or are they too damage prone so just go new? Then are the mopping ones worth it? 

Currently looking at the Eufy 15C Max for £164 seems most promising? Looked at the roborock s5 max and I can get one used for £200 is it worth it? Looks in good condition and all the stats on the app are 95% or higher. Equally not sure if it's worth that as there's no warranty. 

So open to suggestions really, if I need to spend more then so be it. Thanks folks."
"For all hardwood floors and ease of use, X1 Omni vs Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra?Hey everyone, I've done a fair amount of research so far on both of these vacuums and the general consensus I get is:

Omni:

- Better for mopping(and less work since it dries the mopping pads for you unlike the roborock?)

- Not as nice for homes with carpet(not relevant to me)

- App/support is much worse than Roborock

Is this fairly accurate and do you believe I'd be happy with either models? 

The Omni having a worse app does sound concerning, but honestly, how bad is it?
Is it truly terrible like some people have stated or is it just a bit worse/less polished than Roborocks? 
Does it still have most of the same features?


The fact that the Omni can dry the mopping pads for you seems to be a major advantage there that isn't talked about too much from what I've read.


I can pick up an Omni today at Bestbuy but would have to wait weeks for the Roborock to get here, so that's another minor bonus"
"Unhappy with j7+I recently picked up a j7+ on sale up here in Canada for $799 which is a pretty decent price. I previously had a Neato D5 and with a toddler running around and 2 cats I was hoping for something that would require less preparation for running, and I liked the auto empty feature. 

I’ve been pretty disappointed honestly. It seems to navigate significantly worse than my old Neato. Not so much in its actual ability to cover the floor but more that it looks so unsure of itself the entire time and takes longer to do it. Especially around the perimeter and chair legs. It also bumps into things more than I expected it would. I also haven’t been impressed to see it leaves quite a few crumbs around in the kitchen. 

Another point of frustration is the obstacle avoidance completely ignores toddler toys. I knew it didn’t have a database for toys and such but I didn’t expect it to just push them around as if they are not there. I also haven’t yet had the obstacle review section work. It always just says “this is where it would appear”. 

I’ve been thinking about returning the j7+ for the roborock S7, but the S7 would be by itself (no auto empty bin). Or the Dreame Z10 Pro since it’s a really big value here at $150 cheaper than both the other options. 

95% of my house is hard flooring. What do you think? Should I go for the S7 without the auto empty?"
"Help me decide what to buy.Hi, hope everything is going well. With the Black Friday deals I can't decide what Robot vacuum cleaner I should buy. Being honest has been reading and watching videos but I am unsure which one is better. I am not going to expend hundreds of dollars in one vacuum but being the first one I want to get a budget one. These are my pics:

360 s5 Lidar robot vacuum with mapping technology 2200 . $169 Amazon.

Wyze Robot vacuum with Lidar technology 2100 PA  $219 Amazon

 Dreametech D9 Robot vaccuum with Lidar technology and mopping function 3000PA. $239 Amazon


Also has been looking at Eufy and Corey but their budget ones doesn't have Lidar. 

Does anyone have experience with one of this? What do you think about my pics?. 

Thanks in advance!"
"Cheap robot vacuum for small apartmentHello,
I am looking at all the options and getting lost, could you advise some models that would do the job? Apartment is 50 sqm, hardwood floors or tiles only without rugs. Also has few edges at the doors about 1- 1.5cm high.
I was looking at Xiaomi Mi Essential Mop and Neatsvor X500, but to be honest have no clue if they would suffice.
Any reccomendations would be appreciated.

P.s. my budget is up to 200-250 euros"
