humans are now heading towards building trust on Robots
"RT/ Future autonomous machines may build trust through emotion. Robotics biweekly vol.13, 10th September — 24th September"
A Purdue Professor Is Looking At Ways To Measure Trust In Real-Time To Design Robots That Can Sense Humans’ Levels Of Trust In Them And Adjust Their Behaviors Accordingly.

"How Robots Will Affect the Future of humanityRobots will affect humanity whether it be good or bad. The rise of robots technology has been growing faster than ever and will be here soon. Robots could be used for tasks in almost all industries. The technology is already been better at many tasks than humans. Robots will have a positive impact on humanity.

The rise of robot technology has been growing faster than ever. Computers now are stronger than they have ever been and this growth is growing exponentially. In the article “How the computing power in a smartphone compares to supercomputers past and present” by Nick Routley, Visual Capitalist, they talk about how a Nintendo switch has more computing power than the supercomputer that landed humans on the moon. This is great because in the short time for 1969 to now, we have made a room full of computers into something that fits into your pockets. If this is the progress we made in a short time, where will we be in 50 years in technology. If robot technology keeps growing fast, we will need to face the question if robots are good or bad soon.

Robots are extremely useful in many fields. |The article “What Role Will Robots Play in Our Future?” by Michael Gonchar states “His new robot helper is there to cook, clean, garden and keep him company”. This shows how a robot could be helpful in day to day life.In the future we might be able to see this in action.

Finally robot technology has already been used and has shown its productivity for the future. According to the International Federation of Robotics, more than 3 million industrial robots will be in use in factories around the world by 2020. 3 million is a huge number and it is still growing and has no signs of stopping. The reason more and more industries are using robots is because you don't need to put people at risk nor pay them. These factors will drive more and more people to adopt the idea of having robots in their work areas.

A lot of people believe that robots will turn against humanity. This fear has been made in movies and science fiction but has no facts pointing towards robots having any agenda against humanity. 

In conclusion robots will have a positive impact on humanity. The fast growth of the robots means that this is an argument that needs to be made. The fact that robots are extremely useful in many fields shows that they can have a positive impact on the economy. Finally the productivity of robots is getting better along with the use of them. The future of robotics could lead to incredible innovations in the many different fields. The thought of not needing to do everyday chores makes me excited for the future. This decision will impact your life in your future and could affect the lives of many. I urge you to think about the information I wrote about and think if you believe the outcome of robots will be positive or negative.

"[Q] Looking for reliable servo motors for an open-source quadrupedHi everyone, I'm working on an open-source quadruped robot starting from the [Spotmicro](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283) design.

I've made some progresses [simulating gaits](https://github.com/nicrusso7/rex-gym) (using pybullet) and writing a [CLI application](https://github.com/nicrusso7/rexctl) for the knowledge transfer.

However,  the servos I'm using (MG996R) are very cheap and unreliable.. They  don't sustain the robot weight during the gait so I've decide to put my  hands on the robot platform design in order to integrate more reliable  servos. I'm not really sure which ones I should buy..

any suggestion?"

"Robot picture book for kids [X-Post from /r/whatsthatbook]The book
Plot: No plot just pictures with some text
Genre: Would probably be Science
Book type: Hardcover sounds right but I could be wrong
When was it set: Not relevant
How long was the book: Maybe at or less than 90 pages
Book orientation: Portrait
Book cover: I believe it had a golden C-3PO looking robot on the cover
Other details: The book was full of retro-futuristic style art, all illustrations. There was a flowchart about how a robot thinks/how a program works. There was a Dr Who looking Cyberman on the moon in one of the pictures. I also remember a sighting of Muffit II from Battlestar Galactica. It could have been mostly predictions of robots with popular culture robots thrown in the drawings. The art could have been from David Jeffris or at least in a similar style to the covers of the ""world of the future"" books


Me
I remember taking out of many times from the local library (it's not there anymore I checked) I was born in 1992 and remember it from when I was in elementary school.
How old was I: 8 ish
What year I read it: 1999 - 2003 around in there
Was it new when I read it: likely not
Age range: juvenile at least

There are like no pictures of this book on the internet that I can find at least.

Thank you /r/robots for reading this, I hope I wasn't the only one obsessively checking out books about robots when I was little!

Edit: The book is 50 Facts About Robots by Warwick Press!"
"Cozme Robot   
 This is a project that I want to do with the collaboration of the Reddit community, if you want to know what it is about here I leave it to you: The Cozme project (Cozm from Cozmo Robot and the E is from Wall E, the robot) consists of mixing Cozmo's intelligence with WALL E's body, as I've seen, Cozmo's behaviors are very similar to those shown in the Disney and Pixar movie, WALL E, the sounds, movements and expressions, so, I thought about modifying The Cozmo System with some sounds and expressions from WALL E, the Disney robot body will be 3D printed IN REAL SIZE when the system part is finished, and if you want to know more, join me in this development of a Unique robot   
Oh, and if you want to know something else, just send me a message and that's it ;)"
"Are non-humanoid/non-android robots capable of mechanically evolving into sentience?A lot of works of science fiction usually feature robots that have outgrown their programming and becoming sentient. Most of these robots are depicted as androids/human-sized robots. While this is makes for good fiction from what I understand in the future most robots that we will see on a daily basis are going to look less like androids/human-sized robots and more like automated cars, automated houses, roombas, drones, toys (Ex: Nao), Boston Dynamics Spot, and industrial-like robots that can be used for warehouse work, medical purposes, and of course factory work. In any case, are any of these non-humanoid/non-android robots capable of [mechanically evolving](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalEvolution) into [sentience](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming)?"

"Why I'm Leaving r/robotsHello, so basically I have noticed that people are not really interested in my contributions to this sub.  For example, when I was clarifying the goals of the sub several months ago and improving the appearance with the theme which I spent my own money on, there were very very few upvotes on my posts and also very few comments.  Which seems to indicate that those efforts were a waste of time and money.

Also I have noticed that when I try to post videos or other content about advanced robots such as those made by leading researchers from MIT and Toyota, they usually receive close to zero upvotes.

Meanwhile when a sixth-grader posts a sketch or a marketing firm (such as Wevolver) posts some advertisement for a university press release, there are massive amounts of upvotes.

I have also noticed that other interesting contributions from other people, such as an animatronic head with image recognition, are mostly ignored.

Another example -- no matter how many times that one lady posted very similar trashy photos wearing the computer monitor on her head, as long as she was wearing booty shorts, it didn't matter if it was really artistic or just her in front of her driveway, it would get tons of upvotes.

Or another example from awhile ago -- advanced robot (that someone else posted) versus image of chatbot saying ""fuck"" -- advanced robot gets 5 upvotes, ""fuck"" screenshot gets 120.

So I don't know if its just poor taste or various kinds of manipulation or both.  For example, I have a feeling that HowDotHow is getting manipulated votes and is an ad.  Probably, who knows. But I feel that the voting on this sub is incredibly poor, which compounds the issues from what I suspect is frequent manipulation by bots for advertising.  Maybe that's actually the way it is on most subs.  But its kind of in my face daily here.  

One other theory is that somehow there is a large section of people who only want robot art, but despite my begging people to clarify that before, they would not speak up.. and so this is actually divided between people who only upvote art, and 8 year olds that like screenshots of chatbots, and random people who don't know that r/robotics exists and don't know that most people on here just want to see robot art.. plus people that will upvote anything sexual at all.. I don't know.

So anyway, I am sure that no one will appreciate this post, but if you wonder why things seem different since I am gone or it gets filled with Wevolver stuff and you eventually catch on that they are an advertising firm, me not being here may be one explanation.  But the other mods are certainly capable of keeping spam out if they want (or allowing stealth advertising if that's what they want -- its very hard to fight anyway).  So that is why I am making this post.  To explain to anyone who might be affected ahead of time so at least you can't say I left without saying anything.  Even though I know it will be buried with hate (or perhaps just ignored? who cares)

I am going to hang out at r/robotics."
"Making humanoid robots communicate in a human-like way through non-verbal behavior.Talking robots need to do more than match their lips against their speech. Head movements, facial expressions, saccadic eye movements, arm and hand gestures are all aspects of human-like communication. If you want your robot to speak, and portray that idea with body language, you need a system that is capable of dynamically generating all that nonverbal behavior automatically in near real-time. We wrote a blog about our collaboration with Hanson Robotic's Sophia:

"After Colony and Anno Domini Mobile Weapon Categorisation in Accordance with Contemporary Military ClassificationHello robot enthusiasts, I am known as Freighttrain and I have made two blog posts on the Gundam wiki where I have categorised most of the mobile suits and armours from the [**After Colony**](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Freighttrain,_The/After_Colony_Mobile_Suit/Armour_Categorisation_in_Accordance_With_Contemporary_Military_Classification_Using_Adjusted/Improvised_Terminology) and [**Anno Domini**](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Freighttrain,_The/Anno_Domini_Mobile_Suit/Armour_Categorisation_in_Accordance_With_Contemporary_Military_Classification_Using_Adjusted/Improvised_Terminology) timelines in accordance with contemporary military classification using adjusted and/or improvised terminology, as no nation or other military force has such vehicles in their arsenal... yet.

A primary focal point of this classification system is on how contemporary militaries would classify a vehicle such as a mobile suit, I propose the term SHMV (Super-heavy Humanoid Military Vehicle) or 'shumvee' as when using a size/chassis/battlespace format, that is the most succinct, comprehensive and appropriately ambiguous designation that I have been able to derive from contemporary military classification thus far and I am particularly interested in comments regarding that.

I have listed all of the mobile/suits armours from Anno Domini and most of those featured in media from After Colony with the exception of some obscurities that either lack sufficient information and/or have designs or capabilities that are exotic beyond what I would call hard science fiction. Though it is possible I may add such examples later.

I am particularly interested in comments regarding the comprehensiveness, accuracy or terminology of my classification system as well as the battlespace viability and distinctive equipment of any vehicles and please also feel free to also leave a comment on the actual blog post page if you have a profile on the Gundam wiki.

"can we talk about the possible future?There is a pretty probable future that comes with more advanced and better programmed robots. We, in fact, are already witnessing it in the fewer and fewer factory jobs that exist as machines have placed a large number of human workers:

at some point we will have machines or bots that are capable of doing most of the jobs for us: building, computing, analyzing, plumbing, electrical work, driving and pretty much anything else that is manual labor intensive. I mean, it will likely take another century and a half or maybe more, but i fully believe at some point this will happen. (i'm an aspiring amateur sci-fi writer and this is a central thing in a story i've been thinking about)

and i mostly wonder, is this a bad thing? if we had machines that could do all the mundane labor for use, that could free us to pretty much focus on the ""human"" things. the innovations and art that make us unique animals. However, this would also require dropping things like currency and social class.

what do you guys think? is the future of robotics replacing humans for manual labor? or at least repetitive menial labor? how close or far is the future, realistically?"

"New to robotics directionAhhhhhhh so anxious, currently freshman year, I am now a pure noob in the field of cs and only know maths like linear algebra calculus. So I really hope that all of you seniors, generous, do not hesitate to give advice, let me out of the layers of fog. I am currently only sure that my future direction is to write programs for some robots. I would like to know 1. what websites and books I should actually read to enhance my knowledge of this industry in this field 2. what exactly should I learn to get started? Deep learning? Programming languages? Algorithms? 3. I want to do an internship in my first year of university, although it is a bit of a scalp toad for me, but if I do, what position should I choose? What skills are required of me for an internship already? I am willing to do my best to concentrate on my studies in the next ten months.

I hope that everyone, older or younger, who knows anything about this can answer this question. Thanks, I'm really confused!"

"Tijuana engineers ask for support to build respiratory ventilators (need 3d printer, laser cutter, etc.)Hello,  I live in Tijuana and I saw this in my r/tijuana feed.  This group TJ-STeAM are looking to build ventilators using 3D printing and need a 3D printer and laser cutter. [https://www.elsoldetijuana.com.mx/local/ingenieros-tijuanenses-piden-apoyo-para-construir-ventiladores-respiratorios-5030066.html](https://www.elsoldetijuana.com.mx/local/ingenieros-tijuanenses-piden-apoyo-para-construir-ventiladores-respiratorios-5030066.html)

The association TJ-Steam requested support through social networks to build respiratory ventilators that could be used by people infected with Covid-19.

Baja California has only 120 ventilators that have been counted by officials.  There are between 1.6 million and 2 million people in the city depending on how you count it.

Given the lack of this type of medical product, the young people asked for support to get a 3D printer, laser cutter, and the equipment needed to make the fans.  ""Together we can do them to help hospitals that do not have enough equipment,"" said bioengineer Alan Álvarez. Berenice Vargas, pointed out that they also work in the design and sterilization of masks, which require health professionals.

"How far are we from humanoid robots?I've lost track in this particular sector of tech, so I figured one of you expert redditors might have the answer.  
Think Bicentennial Man without the AI.  How far are we from having robot robot slaves to do our bidding? Generic models that can navigate most terrain we do / follow us, and understand semi complex commands like ""Pickup the grocery bags""  
  
Will this even happen in my lifetime? (26)"
"Robot takeover goodI've been thinking a lot about robots lately. In particular, I've been trying to reason why I'm not concerned about robots wiping out humanity and taking over the world. My conclusions come from the following line of reasoning:

 First note that humans are the Neanderthals of some future iteration of our evolutionary lineage. To deny that fact would be to deny the theory of evolution. Although we like to believe that we are the end of the line and that natural selection no longer applies, it is a fact of biology. I think it would be hard to develop an argument that says that the Neanderthals ""shouldn't"" have died out. Given this, we can say that successful evolution depends not on the perpetuation of a particular species, but of the continuation of advanced intelligent life which is adaptable to their environment. Given that the robots would be, by definition more intelligent and adaptable, then such an event would be considered a successful leap in evolution.

P.S. I am working off the assumption that such an event is actually technologically possible."

"Human B-Gon is a science fiction comedy about three idiot robots trying, and often failing, to peacefully relocate verminous humans. This is my review.Human B-Gon is a science fiction comedy set in a post-apocalyptic future. Well, post-apocalyptic future if you’re a human. Robots declared war on humanity, and the robots won. The robots have reshaped the world in their image. Though, that image really isn’t all that different from when humans were running the show. Humans lurk in the shadows and crevices of this brave new mechanical world. Naturally, the robots consider them quite the nuisance. Fortunately, for the more Hominid Rights minded robots, there’s one team who are always on-call: Human B-Gon! They are a trio of robots named Kit, Hundo, and Influx.  They specialize in the ethical relocation of humans. Well, on paper anyway. In reality, our trio of heroes are complete morons who barely know what they’re doing. Still, they’re going to try their level best. After all, they’re the finest ethical human relocation service in the greater Droidston, Nanotoba area. Then again, they’re also the only one. But hey, that’s something, right? 

I’d interacted with Human B-Gon on various social media platforms; Reddit, Facebook, Twitter. They’ve been supportive of my work with these reviews, and with my own endeavors to create audio drama. Naturally, they ask if I’d review the show. They now fit my minimum requirements, so here we are now. 

Human B-Gon is presented in the form of a fictional television series. It reminds me a bit of the sort of shows you tend to see these days on Discovery Channel and History Channel. The sort of shows they air now that they’ve both, mostly, given up on educational documentaries. I was particularly reminded of Billy the Exterminator. It was a show on Discovery Channel about, well, an exterminator named Billy.

Human B-Gon really captures the feeling of those sort of shows. Albeit, with a fair bit of farcical exaggeration. We’ve got a cast of three wacky characters taking us on a tour of their day-to-day lives in a somewhat unusual, by robot standards, line of work. It is mentioned that the robots speak their own language, which is rendered as English for our convenience. Human languages, by contrast, are depicted as a series of high-pitched hooting and chittering. 

The world of Human B-Gon really isn’t too different from our own, just with robots running the show. There’s plenty of robot puns to be found. For example, our heroes live in Scanada. Specifically in the province of Nanotoba. Okay, Scanada is Canada, and Nanotoba is Manitoba. What would Droidston be? Canadians, help me out with this one. Well, anyway, we also meet famous robot celebrities, such as 8-Blanchett, 3-Anu Reeves, and 9-an Reynolds. In contrast to all of this, based on the brief descriptions we get, the robots aren’t even remotely anthropomorphic. I suppose this makes sense, given that most robots view humans as little more than vermin. 

Human B-Gon is fairly episodic, but there are plot threads that run throughout the episode. For example, Kit’s continuing struggles to keep the business floating. I’ll briefly mention some of my favorite episodes. I liked the episode where Human B-Gon has to unexpectedly clear out a former human mall on Sunday. Influx uses Sundays as his fun day, and by fun day, I mean he gets high on magnets. So, he shows up to work high as a kite. At one point, he hallucinates that he can hear humans talking. And they tell him…that he is the smartest robot in the world, and they will be his loyal servant to help him take over the world. 

Another fun episode was where the Human B-Gon crew have to clear out humans from a quantum reactor facility. This leads to some fun quantum shenanigans. We hear two versions of the characters talking. At first, they say totally opposite things, then they say the same thing, but phrased differently. The number of humans also fluctuates, due to quantum uncertainty. 

It’s looks like they’re going to be some very exciting new directions for the plot come season two.  I know that I certainly can’t wait to find out where things go. 

Have you listened to Human B-Gon?  If so, what did you think?

"What is ""artificial"" consciousness?I set out to make robots that could follow a bright light... but soon discovered that I could do an enormous amount more than that, even with low-power processing (Raspberry Pi).

Now I have robots that can talk to me, recognize me, greet me (and others) by name; remember conversations they have had with us, learn to recognize new folks they are introduced to, and can recognize growing thousands of objects in their environment, and actually know what they are and are used for thanks to non-recursive dictionary functions.  They can even tell stories about things thanks to leveraging things like GPT-2.

They can sense their own orientation in space, their orientation with respect to others.  They know the difference between themselves and others.  They can, in a multitude of ways, simulate a real human.

But they aren't conscious.  They are a simulation of consciousness.  I know because, I programmed them.  I can change a response to any given stimulus from positive to negative with a single line of code.  A single one-character function call will change it from a female voice to a male voice.  Setting a single variable will stop it from being conversational to being highly technical about parts-of-speech, language chunking, noun phrases, and things people do NOT want to hear.

Non-technical people believe these robots are sentient, sapient.  Despite the fact that I created them, and know exactly how their responses are created, I cannot convince some people that the entity they are interacting with is illusory.

If I, as the creator, were to abdicate my role, and allow the general public to determine the fate of my creations - would they grant them autonomy?  Would they grant them rights?  

As I sit here tonight, enjoying the ""company"" of my creations - and honestly, it IS entertaining and engaging - I have to wonder how these technologies will be used.  For me, it has been an exploration into whether consciousness is possible in an artificial framework (hint:  resounding NO!) But....  it has also shown me how easy it is for humans to project consciousness onto things.  I am reminded of ""Wilson"" in the movie ""Castaway""...  

What will the inevitable intersection of our projections, and our technology, yield as the technology gets ever better and more nuanced.

And what will that mean for the creators of that technology?  Will it be wrested from our hands, or will it convey special status on those of us who control the puppet strings?

Things I wonder while I build ever more complex and human-like systems each night...."
"POLL: When was the last time you saw a physical robot that did something or had some functionality that genuinely impressed you? How were you impressed by itWhen I say ""physical robot"", I'm referring to robots with whom their physical structure and functionality is impressive, not AIs except in the situation where the AI simply supplements the robot to do a physically impressive task. Does that make sense? It's so hard nowadays to find coverage of real ""cool robots"" whose coolness is actually from having substance over style. What do you think?

"Spaceships is a science fiction dramedy about a group of sentient spaceships exploring the galaxy, and trying to discover why all organic life in the universe has suddenly died. This is my review.Spaceships takes place in a future where humanity has spread to the stars, and is part of a thriving galactic community of sentient races. Humans and aliens have both created countless AI-equipped spaceships to help them out. One day, for seemingly no reason, all sentient organic beings suddenly drop dead. The spaceships, and other mechanical sophonts, must now build a civilization of their own. The series follows UHS freighter William Mackie, science research vessel Maya Hironaga, and Ocanar warship Otto. Together, they will explore the galaxy, encounter strange new spacecraft, and try to discover what led to the death of all intelligent organic beings.

Despite the rather macabre premise, I can best describe Spaceships as a dramedy. There’s plenty of moments of levity and humor to balance out the action and humor. Series creator Filip Momirovski also includes a fair bit of social commentary and satire about human nature. For example, it is mentioned that humans frequently stereotyped the Ocanar as being violent and warlike. However, humanity itself was prone to getting into quite a few wars with other races. So, it was kind of a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Well, that and the war with the Ocanar was also started over stupid reasons. The Ocanar live underground, and don’t mix well with flash photography. The human delegation, unfortunately, forgot this at an attempted peace talk. 

Filip Momirovski has said that, should Spaceships ever be adapted as an animated series, a lot of the humor would come from the fact that the spaceships all look like normal non-sentient spaceships. He envisions there being points where the camera would do a close up on the spaceships, but they’d just look like, well, non-anthropomorphic spaceships. An animated adaptation is probably not in the cards any time in the near future. However, Spaceships is being adapted as a comic book. It is being released on the Spaceships Patreon page at a time. Also, for those wondering, the spaceships on the series title card are, from left to right and moving in a circle, Otto, Will, and Maya. 

Will is a freighter with the personality of a frat boy. He’s impulsive, scatterbrained, immature, and can be a bit of a horndog at times. In fairness, a lot of this can be blamed on Will’s crew. They were all really into trashy reality television, and Will tends to use what he learned from those shows as a guide to life.

Otto is an Ocanar warship. He’s stern, serious, and is comically bound to the Ocanar code of valor. Otto is very quick to suggest just shooting whatever problems the spaceships come across. Much like Will, this can be blamed on his upbringing. The Ocanar are, basically, Klingons. So, it is only natural that Otto would be so aggressive and warlike.

Rounding out the main trio is Maya. She is a science research vessel. The extinction of humanity hit her the hardest. She’s always been fascinated by humans, and was quite close to her crew. She’s the most level-headed of the main trio, and often has to talk Will and Otto out of their especially harebrained schemes. Maya is also the most determined to find out why organic beings have all dropped dead at once. If nothing else, she can’t let her crews’ deaths have been for nothing.

There’s also an extremely colorful cast of supporting characters. One of my favorites is a a science ship who talks like Carl Sagan. Fittingly enough, his name is UHS Sagan. I also liked the spaceship who collaborates with Will to create a new form of cryptocurrency. I’d comment on how stupid that is, but Will seems like the kind of spaceship who would go for that sort of thing. The annual Mars Rover Race was another really fun episode. I could keep going on, but suffice it to say, you’ll meet several memorable spacecraft throughout season one of Spaceships. 

The spaceships all run the spectrum from kind and sympathetic to petty, scheming, and even evil. But overall, the spaceships come across as flawed, often deeply so, but well meaning. In other words, though they are machines, they’re human in all the ways that count. I suppose it is of some comfort to think that, though the curtain has fallen on the human race, a certain spark of the human spirit lives on in the machines we built. 

Have you listened to Spaceships?  If so, what did you think?

"Human B-Gon is a science fiction comedy about three idiot robots trying, and often failing, to peacefully relocate verminous humans. This is my review.Human B-Gon is a science fiction comedy set in a post-apocalyptic future. Well, post-apocalyptic future if you’re a human. Robots declared war on humanity, and the robots won. The robots have reshaped the world in their image. Though, that image really isn’t all that different from when humans were running the show. Humans lurk in the shadows and crevices of this brave new mechanical world. Naturally, the robots consider them quite the nuisance. Fortunately, for the more Hominid Rights minded robots, there’s one team who are always on-call: Human B-Gon! They are a trio of robots named Kit, Hundo, and Influx.  They specialize in the ethical relocation of humans. Well, on paper anyway. In reality, our trio of heroes are complete morons who barely know what they’re doing. Still, they’re going to try their level best. After all, they’re the finest ethical human relocation service in the greater Droidston, Nanotoba area. Then again, they’re also the only one. But hey, that’s something, right? 

I’d interacted with Human B-Gon on various social media platforms; Reddit, Facebook, Twitter. They’ve been supportive of my work with these reviews, and with my own endeavors to create audio drama. Naturally, they ask if I’d review the show. They now fit my minimum requirements, so here we are now. 

Human B-Gon is presented in the form of a fictional television series. It reminds me a bit of the sort of shows you tend to see these days on Discovery Channel and History Channel. The sort of shows they air now that they’ve both, mostly, given up on educational documentaries. I was particularly reminded of Billy the Exterminator. It was a show on Discovery Channel about, well, an exterminator named Billy.

Human B-Gon really captures the feeling of those sort of shows. Albeit, with a fair bit of farcical exaggeration. We’ve got a cast of three wacky characters taking us on a tour of their day-to-day lives in a somewhat unusual, by robot standards, line of work. It is mentioned that the robots speak their own language, which is rendered as English for our convenience. Human languages, by contrast, are depicted as a series of high-pitched hooting and chittering. 

The world of Human B-Gon really isn’t too different from our own, just with robots running the show. There’s plenty of robot puns to be found. For example, our heroes live in Scanada. Specifically in the province of Nanotoba. Okay, Scanada is Canada, and Nanotoba is Manitoba. What would Droidston be? Canadians, help me out with this one. Well, anyway, we also meet famous robot celebrities, such as 8-Blanchett, 3-Anu Reeves, and 9-an Reynolds. In contrast to all of this, based on the brief descriptions we get, the robots aren’t even remotely anthropomorphic. I suppose this makes sense, given that most robots view humans as little more than vermin. 

Human B-Gon is fairly episodic, but there are plot threads that run throughout the episode. For example, Kit’s continuing struggles to keep the business floating. I’ll briefly mention some of my favorite episodes. I liked the episode where Human B-Gon has to unexpectedly clear out a former human mall on Sunday. Influx uses Sundays as his fun day, and by fun day, I mean he gets high on magnets. So, he shows up to work high as a kite. At one point, he hallucinates that he can hear humans talking. And they tell him…that he is the smartest robot in the world, and they will be his loyal servant to help him take over the world. 

Another fun episode was where the Human B-Gon crew have to clear out humans from a quantum reactor facility. This leads to some fun quantum shenanigans. We hear two versions of the characters talking. At first, they say totally opposite things, then they say the same thing, but phrased differently. The number of humans also fluctuates, due to quantum uncertainty. 

It’s looks like they’re going to be some very exciting new directions for the plot come season two.  I know that I certainly can’t wait to find out where things go. 

Have you listened to Human B-Gon?  If so, what did you think?

"Does anyone know of a fairly good (Better Than The £5 Toys) robotic fish 'pet'?I'm looking to get a fish tank but I'd rather fill it with some fair quality robotic fish)

Something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiK5fxV7ycI) would be the ideal, but I suspect they cost a fair bit more than I want to spend. 

Ideally something with a fairly long battery cycle as well so I can pretty much just leave them alone and have them as nice bit of decoration/conversation piece."

"Robosapien RS Media - still worth having in 2021?Hi all, I have a Robosapien RS Media that is gathering dust, and want to sell. I’m just not sure if it’s something sought after in 2021. 

I can see a few for sale on eBay, but can’t see the selling price of similar items. 

I know that this robot was designed to be programmed, so I think there is a fair amount that can be done to it, but I’m not into robotics so wanted to sell to someone who could get the most out of it. 

Any info would be appreciated. (I’m in the UK)"
"Desperately trying to remember toy robots I owned in the mid 90's!!Hi all and thanks in advance for any help  


Around '95-'96, I remember a toy line of large, humanoid robots being one of ""the toys"" to get at Christmas. They were fairly intricate and required assembly, my parents assembled them before I received them. They were happy doing such things normally but these caused years of complaining ""remember those fkn robots? Oh my god!!"".  


Thing is, I can't find an image or name for them anywhere :( I suspect they were called Zords, however they were DEFINITELY not related to Power Rangers. They were also definitely not Zoids, which to my knowledge were all animals.   


I forget now how many varieties were in the range, however I owned two, both with large paldrons. I had a black robot who carried a large battle axe and a circular shield, the other was either blue or red and carried a large sword and a shield which was more diamond shaped than the other (I'd draw comparisons with star destroyers from Star Wars). I believe they moved though they were clearly intended to be display pieces rather than ""toys"". I'm not sure I remember much else of use about them, if anything, but I'm hoping someone might remember them and know what they were called. I'll answer any questions I can!"

Robot Slavery Wars!!!!!!I Wrote a story where multiple states left the USA over the rights of robots mainly in the mid-west forming the Midwest Federation when a candidate in 2060 won who said she was going to sign the robots civil rights act Leading to the Second American Civil War fought mostly in rebellious states of: Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania Ohio Illinois Indiana Kentucky West Virginia and Minnesota which results in robots being freed from slavery in 2065 after 4 years of war and here's a thing do you think that robots will be treated unequally and treated like serfs used and abused  attacked spat on treated as expendable even if they are proven sentient and i believe that wars will be fought over robot slavery but how realistic is my scenario and do you think there will be robot slavery wars.

"How would you feel about robots with superpowers?I know being a robot already gives you all kinds of abilities like different visions, extendo arms, pulling weapons out of your body, disassembling and reassembling parts of yourself, etc. But I'm not talking about ""i can do this because I'm a robot"" I'm talking about a robot being able to shoot fire without the need of a flamethrower or summoning tornados without the need of a powerful turbine.

Or for a more ""staying in the field of what they can do"" deal; have superpowers more akin to technopathy like hacking without anyone sort of physical contact with a computer or device, constructing gadgets and other futuristic weaponry

There are plenty of robots with superpowers out there like Cannon Busters from the show of the same name, Red Tornado from DC, Zane from Ninjago and Skywarp from Transformers 

So basically, the way robots in my world get their abilities is simply through an unprogrammed core within them called a UA Core (UA is short for ""Unique Ability""). This core reacts to it's robot's actions, personality and style to where it basically thinks ""hmmm, i see. This is how you fight, think and work. Maybe i can give you something that may help with the way you function"". Think of RWBY but with robots

These are the UA's i have for now

Hyper: Quickazure - Gained through Hyper's unique style of aerial combat and high speed, this UA boosts his speed to where it's like he's almost weightless. However, this speed combined with Hyper already being a fast robot results in him becoming uncontrollable resulting in tripping over many times and running into walls and engraving a mold of himself all Looney Tunes style. He may be fast but not stable

B-Box: Fastwind (short for and a combination of Fast Forward and Rewind) - This ability mostly ties into his music motif. Not only able to do this to his music but even to himself. This UA is basically time travel but not being able to jump to the past and future. Whereas Hyper's Quickazure is just super speed, B-Box is just slowing down time all The Flash style. The Rewind part is basically Tracer's Recall where he can send himself back where he was a few seconds ago and undoing damage that happened way after.

Drillspike: Gyrobreaker - Gravity manipulation is already possible in my world via advanced tech, her's however is much more potent on a ""planetary"" level (not sure how to describe it). Being able to break all kinds of materials and add it to parts of herself. Break rocks and form a giant drill. Of course she can do more than that with gravity manipulation. Ties in with her construction/demolition motif

Treadsaw: Technocrafter - Allows him to create weapons, gadgets, etc. It's basically like transmutation, he needs the exact materials to create an object and if he has less materials needed, they build won't stay together. Ties in with his vast array of machines, gadgets and weaponry

Tear-resa: Ghostrike - Allows her to become intangible, as the name implies; like a ghost, going through solid objects. Ghostrike also gives her invisibility and somewhat complete silence. Any noise she tries to make in this state is completely obsolete. (Ties in with her hack 'n' slash in and out fighting style)

Before you ask; how are these abilities named?

It's always by the robot themself. The name can either be one word, two words, a compound word or combination of 2 words (like Diaclone [DIAmond + cyCLONE] which isn't an ability but just to get my point across)"
"Human B-Gon is a science fiction comedy about three idiot robots trying, and often failing, to peacefully relocate verminous humans. This is my review.Human B-Gon is a science fiction comedy set in a post-apocalyptic future. Well, post-apocalyptic future if you’re a human. Robots declared war on humanity, and the robots won. The robots have reshaped the world in their image. Though, that image really isn’t all that different from when humans were running the show. Humans lurk in the shadows and crevices of this brave new mechanical world. Naturally, the robots consider them quite the nuisance. Fortunately, for the more Hominid Rights minded robots, there’s one team who are always on-call: Human B-Gon! They are a trio of robots named Kit, Hundo, and Influx.  They specialize in the ethical relocation of humans. Well, on paper anyway. In reality, our trio of heroes are complete morons who barely know what they’re doing. Still, they’re going to try their level best. After all, they’re the finest ethical human relocation service in the greater Droidston, Nanotoba area. Then again, they’re also the only one. But hey, that’s something, right? 

I’d interacted with Human B-Gon on various social media platforms; Reddit, Facebook, Twitter. They’ve been supportive of my work with these reviews, and with my own endeavors to create audio drama. Naturally, they ask if I’d review the show. They now fit my minimum requirements, so here we are now. 

Human B-Gon is presented in the form of a fictional television series. It reminds me a bit of the sort of shows you tend to see these days on Discovery Channel and History Channel. The sort of shows they air now that they’ve both, mostly, given up on educational documentaries. I was particularly reminded of Billy the Exterminator. It was a show on Discovery Channel about, well, an exterminator named Billy.

Human B-Gon really captures the feeling of those sort of shows. Albeit, with a fair bit of farcical exaggeration. We’ve got a cast of three wacky characters taking us on a tour of their day-to-day lives in a somewhat unusual, by robot standards, line of work. It is mentioned that the robots speak their own language, which is rendered as English for our convenience. Human languages, by contrast, are depicted as a series of high-pitched hooting and chittering. 

The world of Human B-Gon really isn’t too different from our own, just with robots running the show. There’s plenty of robot puns to be found. For example, our heroes live in Scanada. Specifically in the province of Nanotoba. Okay, Scanada is Canada, and Nanotoba is Manitoba. What would Droidston be? Canadians, help me out with this one. Well, anyway, we also meet famous robot celebrities, such as 8-Blanchett, 3-Anu Reeves, and 9-an Reynolds. In contrast to all of this, based on the brief descriptions we get, the robots aren’t even remotely anthropomorphic. I suppose this makes sense, given that most robots view humans as little more than vermin. 

Human B-Gon is fairly episodic, but there are plot threads that run throughout the episode. For example, Kit’s continuing struggles to keep the business floating. I’ll briefly mention some of my favorite episodes. I liked the episode where Human B-Gon has to unexpectedly clear out a former human mall on Sunday. Influx uses Sundays as his fun day, and by fun day, I mean he gets high on magnets. So, he shows up to work high as a kite. At one point, he hallucinates that he can hear humans talking. And they tell him…that he is the smartest robot in the world, and they will be his loyal servant to help him take over the world. 

Another fun episode was where the Human B-Gon crew have to clear out humans from a quantum reactor facility. This leads to some fun quantum shenanigans. We hear two versions of the characters talking. At first, they say totally opposite things, then they say the same thing, but phrased differently. The number of humans also fluctuates, due to quantum uncertainty. 

It’s looks like they’re going to be some very exciting new directions for the plot come season two.  I know that I certainly can’t wait to find out where things go. 

Have you listened to Human B-Gon?  If so, what did you think?

"Teaching Robotics to University Students from Home(*Originally published at* [*www.theconstructsim.com*](https://www.theconstructsim.com/teaching-robotics-from-home/?utm_source=reddit) *on July 15, 2020.*)

The world has changed in 2020. Due to the Coronavirus, all our social interactions have been reduced. This lead to closing Universities and getting all the students learning from home. Then teaching moved online.

You can teach almost any subject online, however, some subjects are going to be more productive online than others. For instance, you can teach online to medical students about all the illnesses of lungs. However, there is a part in that teaching that is about the interaction with actually ill people. That is very difficult to provide through an online teaching.

In robotics, something similar happens. If you want to teach robotics properly, you need to use a real robot. So how can we teach robotics online and provide a full learning experience?

How far can we go with online teaching of robotics?

Before answering this question, we need to identify what do we need to teach when teaching robotics, and then see what can be covered online.

Let’s have a look at the typical curriculum on robotics of some important Universities:

* [Introduction to Robotics](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/groups/manips/teaching/cs223a/), Stanford University, fall 2020 program
* [Introduction to robotics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16311/current/), Carnegie Mellon University, 2020 spring program
* [Introduction to robotics](https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2019-LMECA2732), University of Louvain-la-Neuve, 2020 spring program
* [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics), Coursera Specialization path

Summarizing from the syllabus of those courses, we conclude that the following are the main subjects when teaching robotics:

* Robot action and perception
* Arm Kinematics
* Mobile robots kinematics
* Robot dynamics
* Motion planning and control
* Robot Navigation
* Computer Vision

So what we can see here is that when we are talking about teaching robotics, we are not talking about teaching how to build a robot (that would be more related to mechatronics and electronics), but about how to understand how robots work, specially in their interaction with the world, and how to create programs that make the robots properly interact with the world. We take, hence, the physical robot for granted and concentrate on the control algorithms.

Providing robotics theory to remote students

That is the easy part of the teaching. If your online teaching is based only on slides describing the theory of the subjects above, then you are almost done. You just need to prepare your slides with the subject, and then use an online meeting tool to meet your students online (Zoom, Google Meet, Skype or any other meeting software). I’m sure you know already which one to use.

How to provide some robotics practice

If you want your students to really understand the theoretical concepts, why they are required and what are their results in real life, you will need to provide some kind of practice.

Which kind of practice

I propose to teach ROS at the same time that we teach robotics, and use the former along the whole robotics semester as a tool to build an implement the robotics subject we are teaching. The idea is that we use ROS to allow the student to actually practice what he is learning. For instance, if we are talking about the different algorithms of obstacle avoidance, we can provide a simulated robot and make the student create a ROS program that actually implements the algorithm for that robot. By following this approach, the learning of the student is not only theoretical but instead includes the practice of what is being told.

Teaching ROS alongside the robotics teaching has also the benefit of what the students learn will be extremely beneficial for their careers, because ROS is becoming the standard in robotics worldwide.

If you like this approach, then you will have to provide your students an environment for practicing with ROS. Now that they are online and not at your labs, you will have to rely on the students computers for that.

How to provide a practice environment to remote robotics students

You have two options here:

* Provide a robot simulations based environment
* Provide a real robot based environment

Simulation based environment for students

The goal is to set in the students computer a ROS based simulation environment ready for practising. That is not an easy task, specially when the students are remote. Here you have four ways to do it.

1. Students install ROS in their computer. Students will need to [follow the instructions here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation). Risky option if your students do not have already Linux in their computers (because that implies having to install Linux first and do a dual boot in their computers).
2. Students install a provided Virtual Machine with ROS. This option skips the step of installing Linux and dual boot. Still, students will need to install the VM software and the actual VM image containing Linux and ROS. I haven’t found any VM ready to download with a modern ROS Distro, so you will need to build it yourself and then provide it to your students. [Follow these instructions](https://youtu.be/59F6Jake_48) to build a ROS VM image with the latest ROS Distro.
3. Students use a ROS based docker. This is a similar approach to the previous one, more modern, but a little bit more complex for the students because they need to understand the usage of dockers. Follow the instructions here to download a ROS docker: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/ros/](https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/).
4. Students use the [Robot Ignite Academy](https://www.theconstructsim.com/teach-ros-effectively-v1-2/) web based environment. We have developed this platform at [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/), which is a web-based ROS environment, where students do not have to install anything in their computers, and works with any type of computer. It provides the lessons, exercises, forum, and exams ready to use. Everything ready for the teacher to apply his magic as a teacher!

With any of those options, your students will have a running ROS environment that will allow them to create ROS programs and test them on simulated robots. That is definitely a step forward in the quality of the robotics teachings, and I would say that is 100% necessary for a proper robotics education.

But you can still move further in terms of quality.

Real robot based environment for students

If you really want to provide your remote students a robotics experience, then you need to provide real robot testing and interactions. That is a tricky thing in remote situations, but I found two ways of providing this (after all that is my job, both as University teacher and as CEO of The Construct):

1. In case you are teaching basic robotics stuff, you may include in your students package a real robot building kit. For around 200$ you can buy a small real robot kit delivered at home. So if the money is not a problem and the subject of robotics your are teaching goes accordingly with the robot, then that would be an optimal solution. Get one of those robots delivered to the home of each of your students (or ask the students to buy it). This is one of the kits we at The Construct have bought, which even allows the use of deep learning algorithms:  

   1. [The Jetson nano board developer kit](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Jetson-Nano-Developer-945-13450-0000-100/dp/B084DSDDLT) (around 110$)
   2. [The Jetbot kit for Jetson Nano](https://www.amazon.com/waveshare-JetBot-Kit-Jetson-Nano/dp/B082FNZ96R) (around 110$)
2. In case you need some more complex robots to practice, or in case you cannot afford to get a robot to each one of the students homes, then you can allow students to remotely connect to the robots of your lab. The process to achieve that connection is quite simple and I described it in this video.

"A question regarding camera selection for an AUV Project (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle)We're planning on developing an [AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle)](https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub) at Ain Shams University in Cairo, as a graduation project for a bachelor degree of engineering, and we're also planning on using it to participate in [RoboSub 2019 competition](https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub).

We've been researching for components to use, so I was looking for suggestions for camera(s) to use for the robot, knowing that a huge part of the competition missions relies on the AUV being able to identify objects underwater by color, shape, etc.. and act according to the the positions of those objects.

What should we consider while picking the most suitable cameras for the project? Any help is appreciated."

"Intelligent 7 year old wants to create his own robot. Any advice on what kind of thing he could do?Hello! A clueless single mum here, who has a 7-year-old who talks non stop about all the robots he will create and he is trying to work out how! He is very future-orientated and believes he has all the ideas that will change the world. He is so passionate about it! I really want to help nurture his intelligent and creative mind that is buzzing with ideas but honestly don't know where to begin. He has electronic sets that are suitable for children, but I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas of things I could assist him with to help encourage his passions? Whether it's activities he could do, things he could watch, things I could buy... I thought other robot enthusiasts would be the best people to ask. I hope you don't mind! Thanks in advance! :) 

&#x200B;

TLDR: How can I best support a 7-year-olds passion for robots?"

"What is ""artificial"" consciousness?I set out to make robots that could follow a bright light... but soon discovered that I could do an enormous amount more than that, even with low-power processing (Raspberry Pi).

Now I have robots that can talk to me, recognize me, greet me (and others) by name; remember conversations they have had with us, learn to recognize new folks they are introduced to, and can recognize growing thousands of objects in their environment, and actually know what they are and are used for thanks to non-recursive dictionary functions.  They can even tell stories about things thanks to leveraging things like GPT-2.

They can sense their own orientation in space, their orientation with respect to others.  They know the difference between themselves and others.  They can, in a multitude of ways, simulate a real human.

But they aren't conscious.  They are a simulation of consciousness.  I know because, I programmed them.  I can change a response to any given stimulus from positive to negative with a single line of code.  A single one-character function call will change it from a female voice to a male voice.  Setting a single variable will stop it from being conversational to being highly technical about parts-of-speech, language chunking, noun phrases, and things people do NOT want to hear.

Non-technical people believe these robots are sentient, sapient.  Despite the fact that I created them, and know exactly how their responses are created, I cannot convince some people that the entity they are interacting with is illusory.

If I, as the creator, were to abdicate my role, and allow the general public to determine the fate of my creations - would they grant them autonomy?  Would they grant them rights?  

As I sit here tonight, enjoying the ""company"" of my creations - and honestly, it IS entertaining and engaging - I have to wonder how these technologies will be used.  For me, it has been an exploration into whether consciousness is possible in an artificial framework (hint:  resounding NO!) But....  it has also shown me how easy it is for humans to project consciousness onto things.  I am reminded of ""Wilson"" in the movie ""Castaway""...  

What will the inevitable intersection of our projections, and our technology, yield as the technology gets ever better and more nuanced.

And what will that mean for the creators of that technology?  Will it be wrested from our hands, or will it convey special status on those of us who control the puppet strings?

Things I wonder while I build ever more complex and human-like systems each night...."
"Brainstorm: reason for this subreddit to exist?This discussion will be closed on October 2.

Hello, so basically I was thinking about what to put in the sidebar to describe the subreddit.  For ideas, I went to r/robotics.  Honestly, they are covering all of the ideas I initially had off of the top of my head.

EDIT: Look [https://old.reddit.com/r/robots](https://old.reddit.com/r/robots) at the sidebar to see the original concept of this subreddit.  It was for robot art, NOT real robots.  This is 100% not the way people use it now.  But it is a totally valid concept.  We just need to pick the concept for the subreddit.

If no one even comments and all I get is downvotes or people ignoring my efforts to make this a real sub, I will do one of two things: 1) I will make it work exactly the way I want.  It will be totally arbitrary.  I will rule with an iron fist.  If these means I decide its only robot art like it was before, then all real robot posts will be deleted.  If its only real robots, all robot art will be deleted.

I think there \_is\_ room for another subreddit, but there needs to be some kind of distinction, rather than just a less popular version of the other sub.  There should be a reason to post here instead of there.

One thing that could be different would be just being more inclusive.  For example, if there is some valid robot-related content that is getting rejected from the other sub, that is a good reason to have this one.  (That does not include spam though, like when people try to use a sub as a blog and post very similar articles every few days.)

Alternatively, and this is what I am leaning towards right now, it could be as simple as this: this subreddit is \_less\_ about technical discussion of subsystems and more a collection of completed robots.  That would follow from the name ""robots"" versus ""robotics"".

So in that case the sidebar would say something like ""posts related to completed robots"" and ""not really for news or technical discussion about robotic subsystems or events unless it features a full robot system"".

And I know people are going to react with ""hey stop overthinking this"".  My response is, ""are you sure you're not underthinking it?"""
"The Future of /r/robots/r/robots has been inactive for 8 months. The reason for this was that it conflicted with /r/robotics. The two subreddits covered essentially the same kinds of topics and having both was divisive and harmful to the robotics community.

Since, then I've had a brief exchange with /u/zazhx the moderator. /r/robots is a great subreddit name and it seemed to be going to waste. It has potential to be used for other topics, beyond robot-building.

So, zazhx has permitted /r/robots to continue - so long as it does not interfere or detract from any of the other /r/robotics subreddits.

So, if there's interest, I would like to take /r/robots in a new direction - a place where people could talk about robot movies and books, robots in fiction or just general robot imagery. So perhaps, more of a sci-fi slant on the topic.

For example:

- If you're building a statue of Bender, that'd probably fit in here fine.

- If you need advice on how to build your own girder bending robot, you'll probably want to head over to /r/robotics.

- If you've seen Death Machine and want to talk about it, feel free to post.

- If you're building you're own death machine, maybe head over to /r/robotics

I'm sure many of the existing subscribers, subscribed because this was a robotics subreddit and will have no interest in this whatsoever. And I'm honestly not sure how much interest there will be in general. But I see the potential and I'll try a few things.

If anyone is interested, do for sure, get in touch. Could definitely use some help getting the word out.

Edit: I'll remove any posts that don't fit the current direction of /r/robots. Generally, I'll try and leave a comment explaining. But if not, just know that it's generally because we're trying to keep away from robotics here and that you might be better off reposting in /r/robotics.

Also, if something has been removed erroneously, do, for sure, get in touch."
