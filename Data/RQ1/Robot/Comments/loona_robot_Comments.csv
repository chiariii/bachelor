"[""I have/had both. I gave Emo to my uncle as a little buddy for him, that was about 4 months ago so I don't know what updates Emo has had since. \n\nIn terms of intelligence, they were both similar OOTB, with Loona seemingly having more listening/hearing issues than Emo. Although, his invoke command is waaay too easy to trigger with random speech like a TV is on.\n\nI think 'intelligence' is the wrong word to measure these guys with. I think 'longevity of the company' and their vision is more important right now as there's no point in having a super-smart guy if he goes dead after 6 months. To this point, I have no idea which company is in better shape. \n\nThe last BIG factor to consider over intelligence with these two in particular is 'What is your play area and expectations on movement'? \n\nEmo barely moves. His rocking motion of walking is pitifully slow at best and so, he's perfect for your office desk or similar. He:s even less mobile then Vector for example. \n\nLoona on the other hand, moves and moves fast. She'll easily move around a large room and can bump into objects at high speed and potentially get underfoot of people and pets. Loona is too big, heavy and noisy to be up on a desk or a table and has zero edge detection for that kind of situation. \n\nSo, right now, I'd say, pick the robot eith the interaction level they suits you the best right now. Intelligence is a somewhat secondary goal as that is far more reliant on the future state of the company.""]"

I’m still waiting, but it’s only been about 2 weeks.  All in all, I think they’re a relatively newish company, and they have some improvement to make (not an excuse, just a reason), but I get the feeling they’re trying to keep everything straight.

"['No need to reset your router, just change the ssid name and see if it helps.\nBut our ssid has all kinds of symbols in there (-=[ ) and works fine...', 'I just got my Loona today and already I\'ve had to set up its network three times. I have an Android phone.  \nThe first time was fairly easy and it seemed to work, other than insisting on connecting to the wifi extender in my bedroom instead of the router that was sitting 5 feet away. I let it download its updates.\n\nThen I got a message telling me I had to reset the connection again, so I did. This time it was a major pain to set up. I had to reset it twice and force it to connect to my router by unplugging the extender. Then it ran out of battery so I shut it off to charge. \n\nWhich brings me to the third reset. When it was charged and I turned it back on I had to start all over again because it lost the settings I\'d put in. I had to go into Saved Networks and delete the Loona hotspot to get it to connect again. \n\nThen tonight when I finally got to put Loona on the floor and do some testing, I found out that it has a very poor network card with lousy range. I put it on my kitchen floor in a small apartment. My apartment is ""open concept"" so there isn\'t much wall to block the signal. The router was in the living room about 15 feet away. Every time I tried to give a command ""Hello Loona"" it would flash a network disconnected icon. It wouldn\'t respond to any command. When I brought it back into the living room nearer to the router it worked fine (well, mostly fine but this time it wasn\'t because of the connection).\n\nSo if your Loona is flashing a network icon every time you give a command, take it closer to the router and try again.']"
"['Did not get anywhere on this. Emailed support and got this reply which didn\'t really help at all:\n\nThanks for your such great support and patience with Loona. We are very sorry that you are having problems.\nPlease see if the following notes helps:\n[How to speak to Loona]\nWhen Loona is not vigorously moving, (such as autonomous navigation, looking at you, etc.) you can say ""Hello Loona"" to her, she will react to you and face the direction of the sound, after you see the microphone icon shown on the screen, you can give specific voice commend to her.\n[Which commands Loona can recognize]\nHere is Loona\'s voice commends list:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lzImWY1-NjiBfLfmRelY8rhXxaw4UK-mYvEMjQz5kVE/edit?usp=sharing\nThere is also a Wish List of voice commands on this spread sheet. If you have any ideas for Loona\'s voice, please provide them to us and let\'s make Loona evolve together!\n[Loona doesn\'t respond to me]\nLoona is a robot that has multiple DOF movements. The noise generated by these movements may not be loud when heard outside, but these noises are transmitted directly to the microphone through the machine shell, which is much louder than through air transmission. We have taken some moves to improve the current condition.\nOne is that we tried about 40 kinds of materials, and finally chose EPDM materials for Loona’s microphone sound insulation, which can greatly reduce the noise level. At the same time, we added an additional microphone attached to the shell that is specially used to collect the noise generated by motion in the real time, so we can use active noise reduction algorithm to subtract the noise generated by motion from the signal received by the microphone array. This is called active noise cancellation.The same technology is used by Bose earphones and Airpods Pro. The third measure is to collect a large amount of sound generated by Loona, train it through a neural network, and use AI training to improve the recognition rate.\nAlthough these measures have been taken, they still do not completely suppress the impact of motion noise on Loona\'s wake word recognition. When Loona is in vigorous movement, ""Hello Loona"" wake up success rate will be reduced. We will continue to improve Loona’s voice experience through algorithm optimization, but currently, the more effective way is to wake up Loona when she’s not vigorously moving (such as autonomous navigation, looking at you, etc.).\n\xa0\nThanks,\nKEYi Team', ""Tried hard shutdown. No luck unfortunately. I have a fair amount of faith that it's not a widespread issue and hopefully there are just select units with these issues."", 'Thanks.  I haven’t got a response from them yet but this is disappointing because it shows they have not figured out what is happening with mine.  With mine it’s very reliable on the “hello loona” detection, but less reliable with the direction and totally unreliable with the actual commands.  \n\nIt seems if you say hello loona often she will turn and heads up in the wrong direction.  If you say hello loona a few times she might first time look at you and then I repeat it (because she almost never understands the actual command) and she will heads up and turn the wrong way.  \n\nYesterday I gave her another go and for a period of about 5 minutes, I was having more success that usual and was able to get her to respond to a few commands and even some gestures however 5 mins later she was back to basically ignoring every command after responding to “hello loona”.  \n\nI have a feeling that the issue is server side.  I think that loona is uploading the voice command to their servers and waiting for a response and I think that it’s possible they use some kind of cdn and possibly wherever my bot connects to is broken/not responding correctly and they don’t know about it.  This response says to me they will not have the capability to work this out in a short period of time so I’m in for a struggle.  For that 5 min period the node or whatever I connect to changed or was working but then it went back to the broken one or it broke again and it was back to square one.']"

I don't need it for xmas, and I don't need it any sooner than it's ready.  So if it takes longer than 12/28 to reach me I won't be disappointed, I might not even open it right away.

And if you have any more, feel free to leave them down below.\n⠀\n1. How is the progress of Loona now? Can I receive it before Christmas?\nThe production of Loona is proceeding fairly smoothly, and please don't worry! For those who purchased the Christmas delivery, you will receive Loona before Christmas, as we promised. We are getting a lot of messages from people who want to see how production is going, and we will post some videos from the factory on the group soon.\n⠀\n2. Where do I provide shipping information?\nWe will send out a survey to confirm your postal information, and shipment will be created after the product is ready. You will receive updates at each stage.\n⠀\n3. What happens if I change my address after filling the survey? Is there any other method I can use to update or confirm my latest mailing address with you before you start shipping the product?\nWe will start shipping right after collecting the survey with addresses. Please give us your confirmed address when you fill the survey. But you can contact our customer service anytime, and we will see what we can do if anything happens.\n⠀\n4. Does Loona's eye color allow user-defined changes?\nThe preset expressions cannot be modified. But we plan to launch a character editor to allow users to edit Loona's general interaction and emoji design.\n⠀\n5. Any way to mute Loona?\nYou can control the volume of Loona through the app or voice commands. You can turn down the volume of all sound effects to 0 by setting, but the sound of the motor running will still exist.\n⠀\n6. App release date is still Nov?\nLoona's APP will still stick to the original plan and will be released this month.\n⠀\n7. Which shipping company will you be going with? Will it be FedEx, UPS, or other that I may not be aware of?\nWe have logistic partners who will choose the shipping company based on the delivery time. The air express will be delivered by DHL/UPS/FEDEX, depending on the country. We will be updating the shipment tracking number once we dispatch.\n⠀\n8. Where will the parcels be sent from? USA or China?\nThe shipment will be sent from China.\n⠀\n9. For those who backed multiple Loona, stretch goals for each Loona?\nYes, definitely, yes!""]"
