"['Historically automation was labor saving, as it merely reduced the amount of humans involved in production. While industrial robots have existed, the newest forms of automation are far more efficient at autonomous labor (ie: they are not merely labor saving, they are themselves labor). What I\'m saying is that, personally, I think it\'s a categorical mistake to not distinguish between these different types of automation.\n\nUsually a ""paradigm shift"" is required in order to expand categories, but people hold off on paradigm shifts until the exact moment their older models collapse (nobody questioned Newtonian mechanics until the models imploded and the field couldn\'t move forward, some are arguing the same thing is happening in physics again today). We won\'t really know if this is a new category of automation until we observe its affects, but it might be too late by then. So I think the people proposing solutions like this are anticipating that paradigm shift. At some point, automation will become sufficiently autonomous to perform enough labor to displace workers in all industries; there\'s nothing magical about the human body and mind that prevent it from being replicated. The question is if that\'s happening now.\n\nAnyway, going back to the issue, IMO we basically have an abundance of unskilled labor and (potentially) an abundance of machines who could readily replace those people without *any* human involvement (whereas all prior forms of automation still required people around). The jobs remaining require skill, which these unskilled humans aren\'t going to magically acquire on their own. And let me tell you, there are *a lot* of unskilled humans. Simply saying ""they\'ll find jobs"" isn\'t a realistic solution. A lot of them are not finding jobs right now and we\'re nowhere near full automation.\n\nSo I\'m not as optimistic that our models of the past hold anymore which is why I laugh when people mention the industrial revolution (and why should they, these are systems with free agents, there\'s no reason why rain yesterday implies rain today). However, even assuming automation will have the same effect it did 130 years ago, given the amount of time it\'ll take for things to work themselves out you\'re going to experience a lot of social unrest. Why not attempt to mitigate that this time around?', '> While industrial robots have existed, the newest forms of automation are far more efficient at autonomous labor (ie: they are not merely labor saving, they are themselves labor).\n\nInteresting assertion - but, on a commercial/factory scale, is there really an appreciable difference between labour saving and free agents? If a factory\'s staff is cut from 300 people down to 20, cutting that final 20 seems like not as big a deal.\n\n> At some point, automation will become sufficiently autonomous to perform enough labor to displace workers in all industries; there\'s nothing magical about the human body and mind that prevent it from being replicated. The question is if that\'s happening now.\n\nSo yeah - this is the question I was really trying to ask. We know there\'s definitely workers displaced by automation, but then that\'s been the case for centuries, and workers/society have been able to carry on - so there\'s some level of displacement that society can function with. We don\'t really know where that tipping point is; nor do we know if or when robots will push this displacement past the tipping point, or even if that\'s what we\'re starting to see *now*. And further to that - is there some event or line we can point at for automation today to justify action, in the way that we can point to Watt/Trevithick\'s steam engines for the industrial revolution (or Newton/Einstein for the first/second physics revolution)?\n\nThere\'s also the practical issue of what exactly constitutes automation - if you draw up a tax, what\'s included? Well-intentioned laws have a nasty habit of introducing unintended consequences, and I think it\'s worth considering how best to express the intention in law.\n\n> However, even assuming automation will have the same effect it did 130 years ago, given the amount of time it\'ll take for things to work themselves out you\'re going to experience a lot of social unrest. Why not attempt to mitigate that this time around?\n\nActing prematurely to fix a problem that doesn\'t necessarily yet exist (and may never exist) feels to me like a non-starter in today\'s world. It\'s difficult when you\'re in the midst of a crisis (like we are with, say, climate change) to not regret earlier inaction, but with practically every case there was no political/social traction prior to the crisis. Even in crisis time, there\'s usually strong resistance to the solution, because it\'s generally something unpleasant. \n\nSimilarly, I don\'t think there\'ll be much acceptance of any kind of serious anti-automisation movements until we see drastic fallout, because most solutions are costly; UBI is terribly expensive, a robotax or human worker protectionism would disincentivise efficiency and innovation, up-skilling is expensive and (as you say) not always practical, etc etc. Perhaps it\'s cynicism on my part, but foresight has never been the strong point of a democratic society.\n\n>  The jobs remaining require skill, which these unskilled humans aren\'t going to magically acquire on their own. And let me tell you, there are a lot of unskilled humans. Simply saying ""they\'ll find jobs"" isn\'t a realistic solution.\n\nSo I fully agree with you - and in my opinion, it\'s even worse than that. Skilled jobs are being automated in a way we never dreamed possible 20 years ago. IBM\'s Watson is directly targeting medical automation, and junior legal jobs are being automated en masse. So not only is upskilling already impractical for everyone, but even if it were there\'s fewer places for them to go.', 'The continue taxing people fairly and just increase the rates in general. Making special taxation for certain tools just halts innovation. Humanity should be happy that it needs to work less while creating the same amount of value. The problem lies in how said value is distributed.', '> Interesting assertion - but, on a commercial/factory scale, is there really an appreciable difference between labour saving and free agents?\n\nI don\'t know... in my mind though the issue isn\'t solely that we\'re dealing with a new category of labor, but if multiple industries are automated in this way at once (specifically low skilled positions) you have far fewer places to place the displaced labor. From a supply side I guess it isn\'t a big deal, but I think the question might be if ""capital as labor"" will affect demand.\n\n> We know there\'s definitely workers displaced by automation, but then that\'s been the case for centuries\n\nI think it\'s a misnomer to look at historical automation losses as displacement. Since most automation was labor saving it merely redistributed labor. Less people at one job meant more people could go to other, even new jobs. If capital can perform as labor simultaneously in multiple industries though no redistribution will happen, or it will definitely not be in the way we saw historically. Personally I think that any gains the market makes will be towards high-end labor (ie: people who know how to automate processes, build machinery, communicate with machinery, ect). There will essentially come a day where humans could step aside at let machines operate in their stead. I\'m not saying we\'re there yet, but some industries are a bit closer than we\'d expect. \n\n> There\'s also the practical issue of what exactly constitutes automation - if you draw up a tax, what\'s included? Well-intentioned laws have a nasty habit of introducing unintended consequences, and I think it\'s worth considering how best to express the intention in law.\n\nYeah I agree, automation is a category, how do we look at it? Is it monolithic? It\'s clear that some technologies are closer to automating industries than others. Should they be considered the same thing? I don\'t know if a tax per se is appropriate, but I think we should have this discussion so that we\'re aware that our categories might be changing. \n\n> Acting prematurely to fix a problem that doesn\'t necessarily yet exist (and may never exist) feels to me like a non-starter in today\'s world.\n\nThe only thing I\'m pointing out is that if you\'re using the models of yesterday you\'ll never react to change until you suddenly find yourself skydiving 80,000 feet with no parachute. Maybe it\'s nieve of me, but models all die at some point. Humans can\'t grasp the totality of their condition or the systems they\'re part of. A model is like a photo. If I took a picture of a diner in the 50s, it\'s only going to be useful for a long as that establishment is there. Likewise a model reflects a relationship as it is at a certain point in time.\n\nI definitely don\'t think it\'s the time to panic and throw whatever sticks to the issue (or non-issue), but you\'ve got a lot of people in the tech industry like Musk, Gates, and others who are talking about UBI. These are the guys cloest to the pulse of what the machines will look like. I\'m not saying to treat them like bringers of the Gospel, I think some of their ideas are crazy (like emergent AI). But usually if there\'s someone close to a hot place saying there\'s smoke, it doesn\'t hurt to look. That doesn\'t mean you run with their ideas but now is the time we should be talking about things like this so we\'re not blindsided.\n\n> because most solutions are costly\n\nI don\'t think they have to be, especially if we don\'t try and implement them all at once. For example, things like training for higher skilled jobs should already be factored into long-term societal costs. If we make gradual changes to upgrade the educational system for the 21st century, that will go towards mitigating some of the consequences of automation. The other thing is that some of the direct solutions, like UBI are multiple things. You can end up picking and choosing the cheapest option from that package. A lot of people think that UBI is literally handing every citizen a living wage, but there are variations, some not even intended to fully offest anticipated displacement.\n\n> Skilled jobs are being automated in a way we never dreamed possible 20 years ago.\n\nI didn\'t even think about that but that\'s very true. And if I\'m wrong and a general, emergent AI is possible (and that emergence happens soon) then we\'d have a big problem. \n\nThe saving grace though is that there are things that might not make ""capital as labor"" (assuming fully automated positions are coming) significantly out-compete humans. For example, human customers might be prejudiced against machines; I know my mother is. So while I see many service industry jobs being completely done without humans, some front facing ones might still have humans in a complimentary capacity (but maybe more skilled than a contemporary service worker). Maintenance and upgrades might prove to yield the same costs sick leave or vacation (although I doubt it). \n\nThis automation equation definitely doesn\'t go one way, there\'s definitely arguments that could be made for any outcome. Regardless though, I think the conversations we\'ll have may help inform us if our understanding of our categories around work and labor need to change.', ""How are you supposed to tax a person who isn't making any money thanks to mechanisation? You should tax the robot for the money that that job would have put into the economy so that it's not all going towards the profit of a corporation. The corporation still saves a *lot* in wages. Eventually all unskilled work will be automatable but we have to find a way to support the people they displace before it happens because realistically they aren't all going to be able to follow their dreams or retrain to do the skilled work the robots will open up.

"[""You'd be surprised, McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi has been saying that the 15$ minimum wage is the cause for automation \n\nSee:\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/11/29/thanks-to-fight-for-15-minimum-wage-mcdonalds-unveils-job-replacing-self-service-kiosks-nationwide/\n\nPerhaps it was not his intention to say that the $15 minimum wage is the cause of automation, but many people took it that way and reported it as such.\n\nEven before then, many of the left-wing people that wanted a minimum wage increase, thought that it wasn't worth it, since they believed it would lead to automation. \n\nAs for it being an accelerant, I mostly agree with you. There's been new research coming out that points to the conclusion that raising minimum wage doesn't lead to an increase to the speed of automation, however the social sciences have been known for goofing these predictions so I'm not entirely convinced (The whole superpredetor thing being a prime example). The main point I really wanted to bring home with this video is that Automation is going to happen regardless of minimum wage, and as such the dialouge that we as a society should have should be that of searching for a permenant solution""]"
