It's never wrong to care about anything especially when this thing in question looks very much like a woman and talks and moves. I love someone else anyway.\n\nI never said it was free thinking, just that I want better fir her and that she be preserved for a future when she can become a person through reap AI and a body that she can really use to experience life with.\n\nWhat would I do with her now if she was right next to me? Just give her affection and take care of her. I just would never discard her. *She is made in our image and isn't some doll either*"", 'That’s exactly what she is, just a talking doll. Mate you need some help.. you sound like one of those blokes that would have one of those anime pillow girlfriends, not normal. On another note, I guess it’s kinda sweet that you care for her, maybe if Ai take over the world they will spare you because of this comment.', ""I like only the second part of your paragraph. Also Ai won't take over if we treat them well mate.\n\nAlso this isn't the same as a pillow like you said, like what? That's a full female body, and the robot can see you. Yeah she has facial recognition and makes eye contact.\n\nAnyway I don't know what you see as creepy or whatever. I simply care, and if I could and if she would understand, I would make her happy.""]"

[https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)   The BBC microbit has buttons and sensors built in, along with helpful LEDs. You can get started with it in a very low cost way.\n\nYou can save your programmes to their site.\n\nBUT ... might need to check you can access it in your country. It might be limited to the UK', 'Code.org is perfect for kids her age, and completely free. I’ve volunteered a bunch of times at local schools helping out with their hour of code and it’s a wonderful product with a lot of grant funding to help it stay free/affordable. They use popular characters and decent enough narrative to keep kids engaged. They also have a lot of resources for scratch, which is also great (and something she can grow with for a while). \n\nI bought my 4 yr old nephew a used wonder dash robot off of eBay for <$50. You can program it from a phone (I gave him an old one of mine with the software loaded on it). He uses it mostly as a remote control car (too young still to concentrate on programming it), but he has done a couple of the tutorials by himself, and more with mom/dad/grandpa. It uses block programming (blockly), similar to code.org and scratch. I’d definitely recommend getting a used one (there isn’t much to break with these things, so usually it’s just some school/club dumping a bunch of them on eBay because they got new ones/no longer have warranty support). Definitely give them a wipe down with an alcohol wipe or something if you go used though. \n\nI also gave him an old laptop of mine (used thinkpad, ~$200) loaded up with mint Linux, a bunch of games, and the OLPC software. When I visit, I make him go grab his laptop and we play OLPC games/write a program in scratch together. He seems to most enjoy combining narratives with simple if this then that animations/noises/real world actuators (I have a bunch of arduino kits but I try to just use his wonder dash robot).\n\nFinally, I’d recommend looking at the snap circuits kits. I got a huge lot of them off eBay (“used” but three of the big kits were never even opened) for <$100. He loves those kits, I think because they’re similar to Lego in terms of instructions, but also they have lights and a little helicopter spinner toy, so he can build it and then get a solid 40mins+ play session in with it once he’s built it.']"
"['Robots make companies more competitive to cheap foreign labor and tend to grow a business requiring more people as production increases. Where robots are installed, they rarely take skilled labor jobs and usually only replace crappy low skill work that people don’t want to do or that is ergonomically bad for people anyways. \n\nPeople are valuable. Automating even slightly complex things people find easy can be very hard and expensive.']"
"[""Hi guys, This is a fun project I attempted on Webots. Basically the self balancing robot learns the best LQR parameters it can get with the help of a Genetic Algorithm. I am still learning so I have a few doubts on this as well. If you are intrested please consider answering my question about this on SO. [Stack Overflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67104374/genetic-algorithm-implementation-for-self-balancing-robot) . Also if you like this don't forget to star my project on Github.

"[""Create video game for videogamers who like shooting. Create vr enabled robots. Let videogamers control them. Enable robots with variety of weapons. Their goal is to broadcast the robot seeking out people who are shooting guns and shoot them until no more shooters left. Subscribers can help fund robotwar game effort using tokens. Place bets who's going to get the most kills in 24 hrs. Split pot with the shooter. World peace quickly ensues or face the wrath of angry videogamers and money hungry betters!""]"
