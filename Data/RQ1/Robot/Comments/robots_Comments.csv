So I hacked into some buck/boost modules I also had lying around, allowing me to go from 6-12V to anywhere between 0-24V controlled by the arduino on top, while also limiting the max current to 0.8A (using only a fraction of that for normal operation). And as the motors also output 600 Hall signals per revolution (after the gears), I'm using that with the Arduino to update the voltage hundreds of times per second using my own PID-like feedback to get really fine-grained control. In fact, this is actually only 20% of its max speed, and it can fairly smoothly go from even slower to really/scarily fast.

"['Nowadays, robots are found in a growing number of areas where they collaborate closely with humans. Enabled by lightweight materials and safety sensors, these cobots are gaining increasing popularity in domestic care, where they support people with physical impairments in their everyday lives. However, when cobots perform actions autonomously, it remains challenging for human collaborators to understand and predict their behavior, which is crucial for achieving trust and user acceptance. One significant aspect of predicting cobot behavior is understanding their perception and comprehending how they “see” the world. To tackle this challenge, we compared three different visualization techniques for Spatial Augmented Reality. All of these communicate cobot perception by visually indicating which objects in the cobot’s surrounding have been identified by their sensors. We compared the well-established visualizations Wedge and Halo against our proposed visualization Line in a remote user experiment with participants suffering from physical impairments. In a second remote experiment, we validated these findings with a broader non-specific user base. Our findings show that Line, a lower complexity visualization, results in significantly faster reaction times compared to Halo, and lower task load compared to both Wedge and Halo. Overall, users prefer Line as a more straightforward visualization. In Spatial Augmented Reality, with its known disadvantage of limited projection area size, established off-screen visualizations are not effective in communicating cobot perception and Line presents an easy-to-understand alternative.\n\nFind the full article here: [https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/3/755/htm](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/3/755/htm)']"

However, I've watched several videos from CES and I know for a fact many of the interactions are completely controlled by the AI.  There's no way you can consistently type as fast and as free from mistakes throughout the day to respond as fast as the robot did.  You can't even select from a list of responses with as fast as the robot was responding in real time.  Some of the motions are hard coded sure, but there's definitely some that are completely reactionary to the environment.  \n\nEven in this specific video, I'm not sure the interaction was that advanced that it couldn't be done by a robot.  The robot used inflection in even its most canned and repeated responses, so that's not a good indication that it was puppeted.  Even in canned responses that were controlled by the AI, it can use a variety of permutations to make the speech sound more varied.  It's not too hard for the developers to see this question being asked and prepare a variable script that the robot can then select responses in real time.  I wish the developer would have been more clear on what interactions were controlled by the AI or not, but there's plenty of evidence that a good chunk of the interactions were in fact controlled by AI."", ""I do have a question actually.  If it's done by a human, do you think it's through a microphone or is there someone selecting responses on a computer?  If it's through a voice artist, why even limit themselves to the pre-recorded lines they did?  You can have the full range of human interaction since you're interacting with a human, so if they were duping people that way, why stop where they did?  If it's through some guy on a keyboard selecting pre-recorded responses, I guarantee it's AI that's selecting the responses for the human to confirm as there's no way a human can sort through a huge list of responses that fast and select the right one.  If you're already to that point, why not just cut out the middle man?  I think the explanation that makes the most sense is exactly what I said.  The canned responses they used to answer many of the human questions in a low density environment was performed entirely by the AI of the robot, and I think this is well within the capabilities of today's AI.  Some of the more dynamic interactions with the larger crowds may have been performed by a voice actor.  I think this is the explanation that makes the most sense."", ""I've been following robot development for a very long time and know what they're capable of.  Not to mention that just because you're in the field doesn't mean that you're right.  Oftentimes, the opposite is true where people within the field underestimate other approaches.  This is a real effect and probably due to the fact that they put a lot of work into another concept and struggled to make it work, so they end up having a bias against other concepts because of it.\n\nI wasn't asking a question either.  I know for a fact the majority of both physical and verbal interactions were controlled by AI.  Maybe some of them were puppeteered, but the majority weren't and their spokesperson even said the same when interviewed."", ""Also, there's no way the vast majority of vocal interactions were typed or even selected from a list.  This conference lasted for hours and there's thousands of people checking the robot out during that time.  Also words are spoken at 150 wpm, while professional typists are usually under 100 wpm.  There's no way any human has the stamina to type out responses in the exact same way without any mistakes for every little interaction in an hours long conference.  Using a keyboard to select from a huge range of responses is also implausible for largely the same reason.  The speed the robot was responding was too fast and consistent for either of these explanations to make sense.  \n\nThat just leaves someone operating through a microphone or that the robot was in fact controlled by AI.  For the vast majority of interactions, I don't believe any person has the stamina to repeat those same long, specific lines over and over again in the exact same way throughout an hours long presentation.  That leaves the only plausible explanation that the robot was controlled by AI the majority of the time."", 'The lines said in this video seem improvised by a human. They could have aranged a set of prefixed answers to questions before hand, and may have recorded them or pronounced them live. Since this is a single animatronic for marketing, there is perfect sense in having a human reply to questions, as actually deploying a set of tools to do that would be much more complicated. The only set of machine learning tools that could get close to this level would be a GPT like language model for generating what to say, and an off-the-shelf text-to-speech engine. \nThat said, again, the impressive thing here is how realistic facial muscles look, and that’s probably what they want to sell, but the rest is teleoperated by a human most certainly, and there may be both live speaking through a mic and selecting a set of pre-recorded responses.']"

"['The way a plow works is you need a lot of power to push your vehicle forward. This is why we made dedicated snowplow vehicles rather than make a jeep attachment (though I’m sure that exists somewhere). These robots probably only have enough power to move forward at a brisk rate - on properly maintained roads. No way they have enough power to make deliveries AND plow snow, not with the battery and motors they have at least. \n\nThe other guy said spinning bristles worked but notice, powered method of removing snow. But also consider that again, that’s power being sucked out of your battery, which reduces your operational range when you need to deliver while plowing snow. It’ll work, so long as your customers aren’t literally at the edge of your clear road operational range.']"
"[""Benefits of robotics\r  \nThe first steps taken during the Industrial Revolution do not hold a candle to the tremendous momentum produced by the development of computer science and telecommunications. These machines are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable of performing more activities with prodigious precision, and their behaviour can be programmed and analysed to improve their performance.\r  \n\r  \nAnd it is because robots are designed to help humans. As the consulting firm Deloitte points out, robotics programmes help companies and organisations increase their productivity, reduce costs and adapt their production according to demands, as they can work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Moreover, thanks to the use of computing, they generate data that can be analysed to optimise their use.\r  \n\r  \nUses of robotics\r  \nDigitalisation and connectivity growth allows for improved automation processes, one of the most important features of robotics. The following are some of the most prominent examples of the use of robot programming:\r  \n\r  \nMedicine: in Spain, robotic surgery is a well-established reality already in hospitals such as the Fundación Jiménez Díaz in Madrid. Thanks to the use of the Da Vinci Xi robot, the surgical approach to rectal cancer achieves positive oncological results and a reduction in postoperative pain, thus reducing hospital stays.\r  \nAutomotive sector: it is one of the major beneficiaries and promoters. Japanese automotive companies such as Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi, among others, have been stimulating innovation in machinery, and consequently in robotics, since the 1970s. The near future lies in the autonomous car.\n\n\r  \nEnergy: in this area, they are mainly used in automated and remote maintenance, infrastructure inspection, and in segments such as energy transmission and distribution. One of the major additions has been the use of drones to maintain and repair hard-to-reach infrastructure, for example in onshore and offshore wind farms.\n\n\r  \nLogistics: The application of these tools in business solutions has also constituted a turning point for the improvement of processes such as logistics. Automating warehouse activities improves the supply chain by reducing the handling times of goods, automating internal organisation and improving operator safety. Years ago, companies such as Amazon implemented this type of mobile robots in their warehouses.\n\n\r  \nFactory: The use of industrial robots, such as articulated arms or collaborative robots, also known as cobots, is already common practice in factories. This makes it possible to improve production efficiency and other aspects such as costs and energy efficiency.\r  \nEducation: educational robotics designs action-oriented plans to develop students' motor and cognitive skills, promote participation, curiosity and interest in research, and make a fun experience out of each didactic unit. It is a tool that educators can use to enhance their students' experience.\n\n\r  \nHome: The domestic sphere is no stranger to its benefits. Kitchen robots or hoovers which scan the surface to be cleaned, detect obstacles and adjust their intensity depending on the characteristics of the house (if there are pets, for example) are widely known. Other devices assist in the care of older people who may suffer from physical or cognitive impairment.\n\n\r  \nNeed for change\r  \nThe development of robotics is linked to the fourth industrial revolution and the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, which make it possible for robots to learn. Digitalisation has also pushed robotics programmes to enter fully into the Industry 4.0 arena and influence sectors such as aerospace and agriculture.""]"

Would you like help?""\n\nSlightly less flippantly, Diamond Age when?', ""To summarize the article:\nResearchers wrote an algorithm to detect when a person looks at a thing, then at the robot, then back at the thing. This is something people do when they want help or confirmation they're doing the right thing, so it makes sense for robots to detect it and respond appropriately.\n\nIt's very light on details about how they did this. And IMHO it seems like a kinda pointless thing to do. Human robot interaction is so far from human-human interaction that humans generally don't assume that the robot can read their body language and nonverbal cues. So a human is unlikely to use this gaze technique to tell a robot they need help unless they are explicitly aware that the robot incorporates this gaze detection. And if they are aware of it they'll be doing the gazing consciously rather than subconsciously, which means they'll get frustrated if the robot fails to detect their gaze based request for help.\n\nIf the user is at the point where they have to consciously request help, they might as well use speech rather than a much harder to detect sequence of gazes.""]"
