Why are we reluctant to trust robots? Psychology research shows people mistrust those who make moral decisions by calculating costs and benefits – like computers do.

"How do you regain your expressiveness?I remember that around 5 years ago I was able to express my feelings freely through my speech ( mainly intonation ). I've became really isolated for past years and my social skills and expressiveness dimnished.

Back in the past I was able to make people laugh with my wittiness now I am a chode who talks like a robot.

Is it possible to be expressive through speech again? Are there any exercises for that?"

Who’s Trustworthy? A Robot Can Help Teach Us
"Am I a sociopath? Just curious.First, an admission, that I was brought to ask myself this question after watching the series ""Dexter"". At first I thought, ""Wow. Ok, I'm definitely normal. Not like this guy at all."". But then, on further consideration, thoughts and questions started adding up. 

Perhaps I don't fit the profile. Perhaps it's psychosomatic, or outright wrong. But;

With the exception of my early childhood ( < 5 yrs) I haven't made friends normally. One of two things happens a) I see people and deliberately try to be friends with them. b) I ""end up"" with a certain group, and later realize that they think of me as a friend.

Through high school, and as an adult now, behind all my friendships I feel like I'm keeping a secret. I don't really care about the people I'm with. I deliberately laugh and smile when they say things. I text them saying I miss them when I'm gone, but it's completely deliberate. That's what friends do. I've only ""missed"" people during a few special circumstance. Most of the time the emotion is confusing to me. I'm either going to see them again or not.

Until a year or two ago, I had never had a friendship last longer than three years. I have all these forgotten dynasties of circles of friends in my past. I don't miss them. My current circle is attached to me, but we're too different. I tried to ""phase them out"" last year. Figured it would take that long to do it... but it hasn't worked yet.

And at work, it's like I live a double life. Totally on robot mode there. I pretend to like the bosses dog, and the boss himself. He thinks we're friends. We go out to lunch now and then, and I'm nothing but lies. Not ""factual"" lies, but... laughing when nothing's funny, feigning interest. I've left that job since. Lied about why I was leaving, and didn't care.

Also ""friendship"" is confusing to me. I can watch to people together, and see that they have similar interests, and hang out, and like each other, but it's a logical leap I'm learning to make, inferring that they are ""friends"". Same thing when it's me. Every now and then I'll realize that there's a person I hang out with, and who calls me. Just this week in fact, I realized I was ""Friends"" with someone. We're hanging out tomorrow. I hang out deliberately- out of the idea that it's good for my brain to have human contact.

I was once trying to be honest with a girl I was involved with... being open in an email, and I referred to her as a variable. Indirectly... but it was the wrong thing to say apparently.

As for other, non-social emotions? I practically never get angry. Absolutely not violent. I don't panic. 

So... too long. Too self indulgent. Just wondering if this is normal social stuff people deal with, or if I really am different on the inside.


++Update++
 It's looking as though I'm mostly a normal guy.
