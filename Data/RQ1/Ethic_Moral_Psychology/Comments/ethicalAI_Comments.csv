"[""1. Because it is something I know will be important for well being of people in the near future, it also happens to be directly linked to stuff I do at work. The fields that interest me the most are the ones that could bring the most prosperity to people at the smallest cost. AI methods to help us engineer optimal parts for our structures and vehicles, help us plan optimal city design, transport schedules, trade routes, supply lines, AI powered diagnosis methods (healthcare), AI powered chemistry including the new protein design methods, AI powered microelectronic design. I'm interested by this because as an engineer I know how general public thinks these things are done now vs how they are really done now - based on some books written 40 years ago, compiled with aid of google by some intern, basing off of 50 year old company legacy traditions that fail to adapt to modern conditions, taken without necessary insights and any good changes because managers believe it is cheap and simple this way, and they need it quick, after all they will be changing job in a few years, so if a technology exists, why waste time to do it from scratch. It happens in all areas and slows our progress, we need to change these practices, and AI is there to help, as if applied correctly it can do years of work in minutes to give  a right answer, or a totally unheard-of solution to a problem, that we can't work out with the methods we have because we are limited in ways that AI is often not (like time efficiency).\n2. I love the fact that so many people have high hopes when it comes to AI, are enthusiastic towards this topic and are not afraid to talk about it to address all the concerns, and cooperate with people from all backgrounds to explore this technology - just like it's done on this subreddit.\n3. I wish more people took on more grounded and realistic approach. We need visionaires, but we don't need people who buy into cheap CGI scams and don't question everything preseted by their idols. You need to question everything your idol says and check him on everything, that's how you know it is worth to look up to him. Don't buy into things that are too good to be true, refrain from expressing support for ideas you don't fully understand, ask a second hand opinion, curb your wishful thinking, don't dismiss information you don't like. Always ask others for more context and information. Don't hate the criticism, it is needed to achieve tangible goals. So basically I wish more people practised critical thinking. Enthusiasm is good, but when uninformed it is not enough and sometimes it can just cause confusion and loss of work and time to say the least - for example, when someone gathers a crowd of easily influenced people and pitches a brilliant to-good-to-be-true idea everybody's seen in the movies, that we'd love to have implemented when we see it presented as a CGI animation and don't really think of the implications. I wish more people could distinguish these false wishful unviable solutions. In real world (not in our power technological fantasies) the real solution is often mundane, simple, safe and boring. I think that many solutions where AI comes in are also like that and I'd like to see more people putting more focus on these boring AI applications. Because they are ofhten the most useful. Having an AI helping design perfect machining process and heating procedure for metal sheets in some factories/foundries in third world countries or optimal settings for a nuclear fission to maximize power plant production while reducing waste, or to calculate weather models, or to produce a new design for a bridge suspension system is mundane and boring, however it would be in my opinion infinitely more helpful than if we instead just turned our forces on designing AI that can operate humanoid robots on Mars and space bases or (a bit controversial, I know) drives autonomic cars (which gives good PR and everybody would love to work on a project like that).\n4. I studied Automatics and Robotics, specialized in Robotics. Did Engineer's disertation on AI and vision systems, with Master thesis in image recognition. I design (not program!) computer games. Now working with voice controlled assistants for VR applications (like, you put on VR headset and talk to some NPCs and they speak back  like a chatbot). I don't think this aspect is as useful to humanity as ones I described in point 3, but I just like it and I'm good at creating AI behaviors that are tailored to interact with humans.\n5. I love games, board, video and others. I don't spend too much playing them though, wish I had more time for that just like had back in the day. I have a [guide on my city](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11dIkVPR_YwEQWmAgvhodViZM7IkZsNmbuXKIXDCt3pQ/edit?usp=sharing) that I post here on Reddit sometimes, so if you ever visit Krak√≥w or Poland in general, you can check it out:)\n6. I just remembered an interesting thing, when I got recommended this subreddit via ad. Years ago (like 6-8 years ago) I've seen a similar ad or post on reddit, saying that some institution is looking into creating an international hub for experts dealing in ethics for AI, for the initial phase they were just looking for experts that potentially would want to cooperate at some point in future, with the aim to form a sort of legal body that could advise on AI laws and ethics. I can't remembr, I think they did not specify if it was international linked to specific university, country or international. I applied to them via online form, but they  never responded (I was a student back then and did not have much experience so I guess it made sense). Has anyone heard of an initiative like that? I'm curious if it got anywhere after these years.""]"
