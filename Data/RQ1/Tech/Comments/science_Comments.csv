"[""Yeah, I honestly think that psychopaths are subconsciously drawn to us.  As far as what I do to reconcile?  I try to advocate for others where/when I can.. and that helps a lot.  I voluntarily self identified at work so that I can speak more publicly about my experiences without any fear.  In general, I have a much stronger spine than I used to because now that I know how my brain works I am not second guessing myself or just assuming I am wrong all the time.  In many ways my life started again last year.  I am exiting an unhealthy marriage, trying my best to recover from holding a friend while he died a horrible death from a brain hemorrhage at a party about a year and a half ago.  I am hell bent on living my best life going forward.  Doesn't mean I still don't get mad about it...  Especially the missed opportunities part.  What I mean by that is all the times that doctors should have caught what was going on with me but didn't. \n\n\nIn addition to ASD..  I also have Narcolepsy, anxiety, memory issues (specifically converting speech to long term memory), and SURPRISE! MDD too.  I actually believe it is my ASD that helped save me from my Narcolepsy in a way.  I was  not diagnosed with Narcolepsy until I was 39.  Prior to that, I could never stay awake in school.. despite trying several times.  My family just thought I was lazy.  \n\nI was really lucky and someone that I knew recommended me for a job where he worked despite having no relevant work experience.  So my first job outside of a restaurant was building military grade robots for Northrop Grumman.  While I worked that job I was able to hyper-focus on IT certifications and built a very successful career in IT without a college degree.  Right now I have somewhere around 25 different certifications.  In a way this made my shame around my speech worse though because I woukd be the subject matter expert in something but sometimes the words would ust would go away.  \n\nThe first thing that I did once I was diagnosed and treated for my Narcolepsy was go back to school.  I was able to get my BS in IT Security in 3.5 years.  Now I am slowly working on my MBA... Largely out of spite.""]"

You seem to be implying that we are just guessing and not doing science. Consciousness and what we define as pain is very much linked. Some creatures don\'t experience consciousness like we do (we actually tend to over-anthropomorphize animals rather than the opposite) and thus ""pain"" can be thought of as more of a signal telling the animal to avert the cause, rather than being an actual unpleasant experience as we know it. They simply dont have the mental capacity to think ""oh my goooood this really hurts, I cant handle this!"".

"['Abstract\r  \nAnthropomorphism has traditionally been viewed as a means to compensate for a lack of social connection; therefore, social deficits are considered to facilitate anthropomorphism. In this research, we adopted an alternative growth-oriented perspective of anthropomorphism. We posited that anthropomorphism operates as a means to explore the social world, and thus hypothesized that social connectedness promotes robot anthropomorphism. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three studies (total N = 599) examining the effect of social connectedness on robot anthropomorphism. We found that social connectedness increased robot anthropomorphism. Importantly, genuine interest in social interactions with robots accounted for this effect. In addition, anthropomorphism elicited by social connectedness predicted more favorable attitudes toward robots. These findings enrich the current understanding of anthropomorphism and have practical implications.']"
"['More common than you\'d think. One of my childhood friends had the same scenario play out, we bonded over that ( Jr high) and to this day at 40yrs old we are still very good friends (as are about a half dozen of my childhood friends. When you don\'t date, it\'s easy to maintain friendships. I was born in 83, and had a brother born 1yr 21 days later. Mother was young, 18-19 I think, it\'s hard to get facts out when they both (grandmother, mother) run off emotion and both think the other was ""wrong"". Never seen my dad or even heard his voice. My parents we very young, my grandmother had her (my mom) out of wedlock in the late 50s, and early 60s, back then which was perceived as bad, so she was raised believing her stepdad was her real father and when she found out the truth (about time she had me) all hell broke loose. To this freaking day, at 40yrs old I STILL CANT GET the truth out, and my grandmother has already passed (she raised my brother and me from infants until she died). I gave up trying to figure out the truth back in 2012 when my grandmother was dying from Pancreatic cancer. I called my mom, and told her that if she came over and made peace with her mother on her literal death bed ( dead 4 months later) then I could do the same while we still have time to heal....she refused, called me a ""robot"" and haven\'t spoken to her since. Really plucked me up. I haven\'t dated since I was 21 because (among other similar reasons) I didn\'t want to have a family of my own, I feel like I don\'t deserve one because chances are I would have plucked it up, I was also tired of being hurt but mostly hurting others, I saw all the horrible divorces, lost years/money and decided to transcend what our genitals want us to do, and instead use my one and only life to live, for myself. It\'s selfish, but I\'m content, no divorce, no Xs, no debt, no kids, no drama, no problems. I understand this path isn\'t for most people, most people form unhealthy relationships and maintain them for various reasons while being miserable, often ""for the kids"" Meanwhile they fight in front of said kids daily...it\'s so the adults don\'t have to pay child support, the other actually get a job and so on, it\'s easier to fight daily then start over. That life isn\'t for me, we only get one. The chances I\'ll find q truly compatible mate within the area in travel when there are 8 billion people is slim to none.

"['Someone showed me Craiyon and it was fun to play with prompts for free with low res results. The same tool in different peoples hands was making totally different little scenes. A female friend was making emotional scenes and I was making more literal absurdities. That’s kind of at a surface level of what is possible. AI art. Prompt = picture. But the user shapes the result, the machine does the drawing. \n\nI then got invited to DALL-E 2 after a short waitlist. I had seen a video of what the more advanced artists working with OpenAI were able to do with full toolset. \n\nI learned to use it over a few sessions and how prompts work for style and results. It is sort of unpredictable sometimes which is actually part of the fun IMO. It doesn’t always give you what you ask for or some weird interpretation of what you did, so when using the more advanced tools (mainly a featured called out-painting) it gets interesting for what you can make.\n\nWhen I was first using dall-e 2, it makes scenes on what you ask of it. It’s doing a lot of the artistic control based on human input. That was just square frames with one prompt. I got this criticism that I wasn’t actually making anything, but without me+ the tool it doesn’t.  But they had a point, these are creative industry people. I get their gripe, like the artists that were winning contests against hand drawn/painted pieces.   It’s just a neat trick. There should be separate categories for contests to keep things fair and without hatred at a tool. You can use it as a parlor trick or you can use it as a tool to make some cool and unique stuff, once you gain control of how it works and what it can do. \n\nSo I learned more as the month went on and started making simple multi frame multi prompt out-paintings where I was really gaining control of the tool. Still, these few pieces felt more like “it and me,” than “me and it.” So I decided to dig deeper. I put myself to work to start using the tool like a collage maker and to use it in a more advanced way by making scenes, controlling the style, building a higher res scene with more prompts on a larger canvas. Then began using it where it fell short with the prompt editing tools to make custom collage elements based on what I needed. It gives four results per prompt, so sometimes I got many usable elements.\n\nThen I started using photoshop to combine and add these elements in with feathered selections, scaled and placed to make scenes with depth; scenes that I was imaging then bringing to life with the tools. In a sort of hybrid “what I want/what I get with what it gives me with my credits that cost money” and got some awesome results. Started doing some photoshop based effects and I can upscale it later if I need to. I was also making some super resolution elements with AI upscale to composite in to the larger canvases. \n\nI started feeling like I was making something unique. The messed part is the creative industry people still treat it like lesser than; when without me with the tool the output cannot exist with what a machine does by itself. It is a unique and original piece. Based on massive data training sets, but still not seen before. Not copying someone’s style. Making one of my own.\n\nThis went to the point where a big time comic book colorist friend was going to put some lightning on one for me since I was having trouble with a non ideal workstation to do that effect by hand. He then got scared that he would be blacklisted if people heard he had put a hint of color on an “AI piece.” If I get a real workstation to control my mouse, I can do it myself. I just thought that attitude toward AI was a bit much since people really feel it’s not making anything. Since it often is somewhere in that valley of it with you helping, rather than you with it helping. \n\nI understand it, since I feel that way about some of the users cracking out single frame images of really polished looking stuff like robot women and stuff. But it’s so uninspired sometimes.\n\nA friend has a small following on instagram and he’s really good using different tools, but it’s more of those single images/prompts type result.   \n\nI also made a few out-paintings with my original art as the seed frame and those were pretty cool.\n\nI’ll post some if anyone wants to see the progression.']"
"[""Abstract\r  \nService robots (SRs) are fast becoming the source of automated service delivery processes and personalized frontline customer experiences in service firms. This study investigates the impact of customers' emotional state on how they evaluate service experiences after interacting with an SR, which remains underexplored. Drawing on the theory of constructed emotion and social sharing of emotions, it conducts three online scenario-based experiments. Study 1 shows that customers in a neutral emotional state are more satisfied with the service provided by SRs than are those in a negative emotional state. The mechanisms underlying this dissatisfaction are perceived relatedness and perceived appropriateness, as shown by Study 2. Study 3 demonstrates how SRs' sympathetic capabilities moderate this mediating relationship. The findings were consistent across different emotion manipulation methods, negative emotional states, and sources of emotional states. Given the increasing prominence of SRs on organizational frontlines, this study has numerous theoretical implications for SRs’ interaction with emotional customers and practical implications for employing SRs.""]"
"['Yeah the title is super odd & misleading imo\n\nIt should be worded in a different way.

It\'s exactly as you described \\~ they cared way more about *what* you did in your extracurriculars rather than how many you were involved in. In fact, they actively tried to snuff out any applicants who were intentionally fluffing their resume with tons of filler extracurriculars that they aren\'t really involved with\n\nI saw this in my peers, too. A few people I know while I was in high school were rejected even though they had listed 5+ clubs on their resume and had flawless academic records. Meanwhile, the people I met at that university typically had 1-3 extracurriculars but basically *everyone* was a leader in some capacity\n\nThis particular university is more holistic than most, too. My freshmen year roommate had a 21 ACT and 3.1 GPA (average at that time was 32 and 3.9 or something). He was accepted bc he came from a really, really rough background & he had founded a local non-profit / community-service organization to help those with similar problems. He did literally nothing else outside of that, but he did that very well and I\'m sure his essay demonstrated his passion.

The resulting process is extremely versatile, enabling design freedom and macro-scale control of the fabric’s properties.\n\nThe fabric can also be activated by a lower voltage of electricity than previous systems, making it more energy-efficient and cost-effective. In addition, lower voltage allows integration into smaller, more portable devices, making it suitable for use in biomedical devices and environment sensors.\n\n“The idea of these intelligent materials was first bred and born from biomimicry science,” said Kamkar, director of the Multi-scale Materials Design (MMD) Centre at Waterloo.']"
"['Sufferer of gifted kid syndrome here, and have a minor in education. Gifted programs are extremely problematic for logistical and social reasons, and in lower income areas focusing on them leads to an attitude of focusing on high achieving learners while letting the rest of the student body languish. I get that yes, some kids are just not engaged, but gifted programs focus on those people who are already exceptional and leave the average behind. Gifted kids are motivated to learn outside of school as well, in fact my classes often suffered because I was interested in something else, but I was perceived as being “smart” so I never got booted out of the program. In fact our whole program got a lot more lee way than the rest of the student body, teachers would just make stuff up on the fly for the curriculum and there was like no oversight on the grading. It often felt like we were just being rewarded for bringing up the standardized test average for our school. Like we got to take a robotics course instead of this middle school general science class, so I’ve been programming since I was 12, while the “normal” kids were in some class with multiple choice questions about like, the boiling point of water and healthy human body temperature, that sort of general science knowledge stuff. It’s like a weird catch 22, if your good at the multiple choice test the government has deemed important, you are spared the backwards rote learning approaches your peers are subjected too. The attitude seems to be that unless your exceptional, you will be judged on how much time you are willing to sacrifice for your grades. I think making sure the average student has a fair chance to succeed is more important than providing extra opportunities for people who are deemed “exceptionally” via a system that most educators believe is totally busted.']"
