"['Word salad. \n\nYou\'re laundering bullshit by calling it ""nuance."" These glib assurances are pleasant excuses to ignore that *some questions have a right answer.* Every single headline is pushing your platform, instead of those answers. Each one denigrates the sources you pulp and repackage. Just blathering about bias and concerns and objectivity and perspectives and priorities - when the dominant problem with modern news is naked right-wing propaganda versus insufficiently blunt responses to same. \n\nBut the robot doesn\'t care what\'s right. The robot barely cares what\'s true. An amoral distillation of dry journalism and overt propaganda is carrying water for propaganda by treating it like dry journalism. The whole exercise seems like hyper-automating every pointless false equivalence between (ugh) ""both sides."" A concept pushed exclusively by one side. This isn\'t solving people\'s concerns about eroding trust by flooding the internet with AI-generated distractions; *this is that thing.*\n\nWorse yet: you\'re treating automatic summaries, one step *further* from the truth, as if they\'re ""one step closer to the truth."" How? You\'re not doing additional primary research. Are you even weighting sources based on how often (and how severely) they turn out to be misleading? Will the robot have some long-term guidance based on how often it regurgitates total bollocks? Is there a human being in-the-loop to make sure inexcusable fraud and pointless hair-splitting aren\'t equally valid feedback? Are you prepared to ignore when right-wing cranks call you biased against them no matter how hard you bias yourselves toward them?\n\nPicking a less blindingly-obvious example - ""Spain\'s new gender law."" ""\'This law is a step forward for the rights of transgender people, but it is also a step backward for women’s rights,\' said a representative from a feminist group."" Who? Just ""a feminist group."" Itself probably a lie, if they\'re TERF bigots, scaremongering about ""men in women\'s bathrooms,"" which is denying trans people *exist.* The article then starts talking about Republican-controlled states. Unless the robot mean Francoists, it silently veered toward American-centric commentary even faster than reddit. The wonders of automation! As a result, this disjointed mess talks about attacks on trans rights in ""a third of the country"" even though the only country that\'s *relevant* now firmly protects those rights. The whole country. All three thirds. \n\nAnd then your first listed implication-slash-danger is... ""polarization."" Nah, robot, I\'m pretty sure the primary danger is queer minorities getting fucking murdered. Thankfully the robot does keep an eye out for the safety of doctors. In the wrong country. As item three, after polarization, and oh yeah I guess how these wrong-country bans on healthcare might affect access to healthcare. \n\nYou can\'t *balance* disinformation. I can only be *fought.* Sometimes people are fucking lying. That\'s not ""controversy."" You can\'t fix it by carefully handling the reality and the fraud equally. And the language you use in describing reality sounds an awful lot like the people pushing fraud. \n\nPlease make your next response sound less like you had the robot write it.']"
"[""Predictable. Although it becomes a matter of expense, maintenance, and speed, as well as how expensive the user-end modules are. If the costs can be brought down, it's entirely possible that many labor-intensive jobs may turn into something like [this](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/this-new-tokyo-cafe-has-robot-waiters-controlled-remotely-by-disabled-workers-021621).\n\nAdvantages: workers in what were many blue-collar and pink-collar jobs can now WFH and remotely, saving money and time and increasing their ability to quickly and easily sell their labor over a wider range. The robots can have workers log in to them in shifts, meaning the robots can physically keep working whenever they're not being maintained/inspected/cleaned. Employees won't bring infections to the workplace or to public transport. Employees will be safer. Employers will have lower on-premises employee-injury insurance premiums. Employees can 'work' across sites as employer need dictates, without having to travel during work hours or breaks. Every employer site would be able to have centralized specialist staff log on to an onsite system to handle rare issues. Minor specialist repair work could also be carried out remotely, depending on what tools were available onsite and what the work was.\n\nDisadvantages: an internet or power outage at a workplace will cripple its ability to have any work done. The same at employee homes will make them unable to work. The robots and user-end haptics will cost money to buy and maintain. Remote haptic systems are unlikely to be as responsive and sensitive as in-person human handling, particularly at first, and with lag becoming an issue.\n\nVariable: employers could argue for cameras on the robots which allow them to log and review everything the robot (and thus employee) sees.\n\nUnsure: given the initial cost of user-end systems, the equivalent of coworking spaces for physical jobs may spring up. 300 people turn up at a warehouse and sit down with a haptic system for a shift, providing labor for dozens or hundreds of employers across a wide area, because they can't afford a personal haptic system for their home. Such places would still have contagion issues if the haptic systems are not isolated and/or cleaned regularly.""]"
"[""I was in the same position a couple of years ago. Ended doing a couple of years of non-related software development and then used that experience to move back into automation and robotics.\nAs far as actual advice goes:\n\n* There are many more companies in this industry than you'd ever think. Look up logistics fairs (there'll be a lot of companies showcasing their products and you can use that as a starting point)\n\n* Look up customer/software support roles and apply for them. On some companies, there is a clear progression from that to development roles, but even if there isn't, you'll be racking up relevant experience""]"

"['My wife and I were discussing this exact question last night. I’ve recently been reading up/watching videos on all the new AI advancements and capabilities (a bunch of youtubes, this [60 Minutes](https://youtu.be/880TBXMuzmk) segment is a good one). As I’m digesting it all and we’re laying in bed it suddenly became crystal clear to me. I said to her, “there’s a 100% chance your job won’t exist in five years. We need to figure out what to do before that happens.”  \nShe works at one of the big four US banks managing a team of underwriters. I’ve actually wondered in the past why their processes aren’t more automated, but based on the AI capabilities and intended uses revealed over the last few months it undoubtedly will be in the next several years. Almost entirely.  \nPersonally my job is highly technical and involves a sizable physical component so I should be fairly safe for now. Not that an AI can’t do the thinking part of my job, I have no doubt that it could, but robot autonomy, dexterity, reliability, not to mention power sources, have a long way to go before replacing what I do.  \nAll that said, she is easily the high earner in our family and we really need to have a plan for when her entire profession is made redundant.\n\nEDIT: The only thing that buys us time is the utter and total incompetence of the contract software devs and sys admins at her bank. They’ve been undergoing constant “upgrades” since she started over fifteen years ago, with quite literally nothing to show for it. Tens of millions of dollars spent with uncountable false starts and failed projects. Once *those* idiots are replaced with AI her days will be numbered.']"
"['I am working on spot! And there are two modes of connection WiFi client and access point of the robot (no internet). The access point is useless if you are going by the end of the building the robot falls on the ground. With that being said you would need a client connection without firewalls. That would be a strong network, and that case you would need CORE IO where you can connect the robot to 5G network, I am not sure if Paris has 5G connection coverage.']"

"['People who look to the future can tell the robots are becoming more capable. That is the interesting part that people get excited about not the current state of the art.', 'I guess it depends on how you define collaborative. The ones I have seen had a safety laser monitoring the approach to the robot and if someone was coming the robot would slow to collaborative speed. When no one was around it would speed up and be fairly peppy. Nothing like a real robot like a delta that could kill you with getting a motor stalled error, but a little quicker.', 'There are lots of good use cases for Cobots\n\n1. Simple Machine Load/Unload.\n2. Moving a big heavy part around while operators work on it.\n3. Moving cameras/inspection tools around.\n4. Tray Loading/Palletizing.\n5. There are even examples of cobots welding (But you\'re probably gonna want to put that cobot in a cage).\n\nCobots are almost always slower and more expensive than a similar SCARA or Cartesian system.  A delta robot will usually be fastest, but also most expensive.   SCARA/Cartesian and Delta robots can move fast enough to rip your arm off if there was no safety cage. \n\nNote that UR is not the only game in town.   There are dozens of potential suppliers.   The Chinese knock-offs are already moving in.\n\nCobots are very popular with the SME\'s that may have limited engineering resources.   The **""DIY""** engineer gets a shiny new toy to play with for a few months and they often treat it as a ""playground"".    What gets overlooked are all the other costs in addition to the arm that often are not financially accounted/tracked.  This includes things like:\n\n1. The small parts that the engineer has raided from the toolcrib (fasteners, valves, wiring, connectors).\n2. Things like paint/plating/heat-treating/polishing/welding and just the raw materials costs for plastics and metals.\n3. The amount of time spent adjusting/reworking and scrapping designs that didn\'t work.\n4. The mechanical design hours involved in designing a structure to hold the robot,  end effector tooling, camera brackets, parts presentation fixtures, pneumatics, conveyors, VFD\'s , parts feeders, fasteners etc that might be required.   Many times there is no drawing package that could be easily replicated.   The ""**DIY**"" engineer just builds brackets ""on-the-fly"" with napkin sketches.\n5. The time required to draw electrical designs and pneumatic drawings.\n6. The late night phone calls from midnight shift asking ""why wont the machine run""\n7. The downtime cost for days spent on the machine, making very slight but still important program changes.\n8. The parts that get scrapped while the ""**DIY**"" engineer is tweaking the process i.e working on weld paths, playing with weld voltages and currents.\n9. The costs to develop a user interface that only the engineer understands, with no thoughts as to what a less skilled User/Operator might want.\n10. The costs incurred in purchasing all the ancilliary equipment.   Researching & locating all of the components.  Shipping/Expediting is almost always overlooked.\n11. The natural tendency of an engineer to keep tweaking, especially if there is no clear end-date, means that the schedule keeps shifting to the right.\n12. The ""DIY"" engineer just creates ""on-the-fly"".  There is no URS, no master documents or specifications that describe what the machine will do, there is usually no forethought placed on ""how will we know when we\'re done"".  This leaves the project vulnerable to excessive scope creep, when every department starts wanting to have their particular agenda addressed by the machine.\n13. Your ""DIY"" engineer becomes so wrapped up in the project that there is no time for his/her other work to get done.\n\nUsually there is such a rush to get the machine in production that shortcuts are made.  Sometimes there are no electrical schematics and often the wiring is not professionally done and will not pass a safety review as wires are not labelled or routed properly.    If you had to build a duplicate machine, you simply cant, because the detailed print package doesnt exist and this was on nobody\'s radar at the time that the shiny new toy arrived.\n\nThe **""DIY""** engineer will ensure his/her own job security because no one else knows how to fix/maintain or adjust the machine.  There is no User\'s manual and no trouble shooting guide.    The logic behind the robot programming is known only to one person who may or may not have done a good job documenting what they\'ve done.    There is no training documentation and there is no penalty involved if the machine operates at a rate half of what was initially promised.\n\nIf you\'re okay with all of the above risks, then go ahead and order anybody\'s robot and make sure you have a good **""DIY""** engineer ready to jump on the project.     If its a ""system"" that you want then you may want to contact a system integrator who will:\n\n1. Give you a detailed design package.  With mechanical, electrical details, toleranced and listed in a complete BOM.\n2. Provide a user HMI with varying levels of access for engineers, techs and operators.\n3. Provide a warranty, and training for your team.\n4. Perform maintenance and repair as needed.\n5. Design a system capable of passing a safety review.\n6. Guarantee a level of performance and throughput rate.\n7. Take care of shipping and installing the machine at your factory.\n8. Give you User\'s manuals, Training Manuals and Troubleshooting Manuals.\n9. Give you a fixed price that you can (most of the time) use in your financial forecasts, assuming that there are no major scope creeps that happen as the project evolves.\n10. Provide a safety report and have a professional 3rd party sign off on machine safety.']"
