Why are they going to be replaced and how are they going to be implemented? \n\n*ChatGPT*: Over the next 10 years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are likely to impact various industries and job sectors, leading to the automation or outsourcing of certain tasks. While the specific jobs affected will depend on the pace of technological development and other factors, here are some examples of job roles that could be potentially impacted:\n\n1. Data Entry and Administrative Tasks: Jobs involving manual data entry, data processing, and administrative tasks are susceptible to automation. AI algorithms and robotic process automation (RPA) can streamline these processes, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\n2. Customer Support and Call Centers: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are increasingly being used for customer support interactions. Natural language processing and machine learning algorithms enable these AI systems to understand and respond to customer queries, reducing the need for human operators.\n\n3. Transportation and Delivery Services: With advancements in autonomous vehicles and drones, certain jobs in transportation and delivery services may be replaced. Self-driving trucks, delivery drones, and robotic warehouse systems can streamline logistics operations, potentially reducing the demand for human drivers and manual labor.\n\n4. Manufacturing and Assembly Line Jobs: AI and robotics have the potential to automate various tasks in manufacturing and assembly line operations. Robots can be programmed to perform repetitive or complex tasks with precision and speed, reducing the need for human workers in those roles.\n\n5. Data Analysis and Research: AI algorithms can analyze large datasets and generate insights more efficiently than humans. In fields such as finance, market research, and data analysis, AI systems can assist or replace certain aspects of the work, allowing professionals to focus on higher-level decision-making.\n\nThe primary drivers for job replacement through AI are increased efficiency, cost savings, and improved accuracy. AI systems can work around the clock, have lower error rates compared to humans, and can perform repetitive tasks at a much faster pace. Additionally, advancements in machine learning and natural language processing enable AI systems to understand and process vast amounts of data, making them valuable for tasks involving pattern recognition, data analysis, and decision-making.\n\nImplementation of AI in these job roles can vary depending on the specific task and industry. It may involve developing AI models, integrating AI systems into existing workflows, providing training and data for AI algorithms, and addressing legal and ethical considerations. AI systems can be implemented through cloud-based platforms, on-premises solutions, or as part of specialized hardware systems, depending on the requirements of the task at hand.\n\nIt\'s important to note that while AI may automate certain tasks, it also has the potential to create new job opportunities and shift the nature of work. It often leads to the emergence of hybrid roles, where humans and AI systems work together to leverage the strengths of both. As AI technology continues to evolve, the focus is likely to shift towards jobs that require creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving, where humans have a comparative advantage over AI.']"

Read the plaintext instead!\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/singapore-still-investing-big-in-tech-talent-despite-layoffs.html\n\n>Singapore hasn’t been spared the layoffs that have hit the global tech industry since 2022.\n\n>Online marketplace Carousell cut 10% of its total headcount last December, and Shopee told The Straits Times it started a third round of layoffs last November.\n\n>But despite the downsizing, Singapore is still investing heavily in tech skills. Efforts at hiring and cultivating tech talent — in both the country’s tech and non-tech sectors — continue to be robust.\n\n>Singapore banks OCBC, DBS and UOB have each developed programs that train technology staff and prepare students to enter the tech industry. OCBC, for its part, announced in 2022 plans to hire 1,500 tech employees over the next three years.\n\n>And STLogistics announced last year it would invest 1.7 million Singapore dollars ($1.2 million) to encourage employees to pick up digital skills like software robotics. Singaporean telecommunications company M1 launched a program to equip undergraduate students with skills like cloud infrastructure support, it said on its website.\n\n>Demand for those skills isn’t going away anytime soon — in the tech sector and beyond.\n\n>Tech jobs have become increasingly popular in recent years.\n\n>In 2022, nearly seven in 10 of all vacancies in information and communications were new positions, which a report by the Ministry of Manpower showed was the highest level across all sectors for the third consecutive year.\n\n>Across job vacancies, technology talent like software developers and applications managers continued to be highly sought after, the report added.\n\n>That level of demand is expected to remain as the economy digitalizes, said Terence Chia, cluster director at Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).\n\n>“This has been a consequence of tech companies anchoring and growing their higher-value tech development and corporate functions here,” he said.\n\n>On top of that, demand for individuals in “specialized tech areas” such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity isn’t limited to the tech sector, Chia told CNBC. Such tech workers are needed across multiple industries such as finance, manufacturing, logistics and professional services, he said.\n\n>In finance, technology is the engine that “powers all the big banks,” said Donald MacDonald, OCBC head of group data.\n\n>“We want everyone in the bank to … at least have foundational data literacy,” he said.\n\n>OCBC designed a program that equips employees with basic data skills and teaches them how data can be used in their jobs, he said.\n\n>According to MacDonald, the bank uses data to understand its customer profiles and personalize each customer’s experience.\n\n>Data also plays a part in reducing risk — OCBC scans every transaction to detect scams and uses algorithms to figure out “who to lend to and … how much to lend,” he said.\n\n>Another data analysis program trains employees in divisions like finance and risk management, MacDonald said. It has trained about 400 employees to use advanced data analysis skills like Python, which MacDonald said will help them “move beyond” using Excel and other simple tools.\n\n>“I see Singapore establishing [itself] as a kind of regional hub for A.I. and deep tech,” MacDonald said.\n\n>IMDA’s plans are broader in scale: It has trained more than 15,000 Singaporeans and placed them in specialized tech jobs, said Chia. The jobs span a range of industries, including financial services, wholesale and retail trade, and education, he added.\n\n>Those jobs often have steep learning curves but, Chia said, program participants receive “on-the-job training and classroom learning” to pick up specialized skills.\n\n>One of IMDA’s programs puts non-tech professionals through an “intensive, bootcamp-style experience” that helps them develop into tech professionals, he said.\n\n>Higher education is no exception. Chia said “many leading companies” support IMDA’s joint initiative with the Ministry of Education to train and create job opportunities for tech students in vocational institutes.\n\n>“There continue to be many opportunities in the digital economy for Singaporeans,” Chia said.\n\n>Globally, tech companies have reportedly cut 102,391 jobs so far this year, but the value of tech talent has far from diminished in Singapore.\n\n>Got a confidential news tip?

Because if you don’t, then it stands to reason that one day it will be capable of writing its own algorithms and code eventually. Ai can already fold proteins beyond what humans are capable of.

The fact is that there *will* be people who don't have monetisable skills, because those people's jobs *will* be superseded by robots and programming. Either they need to find new jobs, or they cannot work and thus the wider community needs to fund their livelihoods unless they want them to become vagrants.\n\nAs for the programmers themselves: if they don't do programming, then obviously there won't be robots to supplant the less-skilled people's jobs. If they *do* continue to do programming, they will be compensated handsomely for it, I can assure you.\n\nThere's already class resentment, and most of it is ill-founded, IMO. If you take issue with the idea that there will be wide income disparity in a future of mostly robot workers, realise that there is already wide income disparity today, and that redistribution of wealth (via systems like taxation) is the only real way to counter that, because wage markets will function how they'll function regardless.

Computers & technology do all of the work, freeing humans to pursue lives of art, exploration, adventure, whatever. There\'s not even any need for money (shhh.. don\'t tell the Ferengis). I sound like I\'m mocking it but technology can absolutely take us to such a reality. IF (huge emphasis on that ""if"") civilization can survive the adjustment period.  \n\nFor example, technology will (relatively) soon remove 99-100% of transportation jobs (truck drivers, mainly). All of those people will be unemployed and have to scramble to find other work OR get public assistance. Sucks for them, of course, but as a percentage of the workforce it would be relatively light. The impact on the economy would be small.  \n\nBut... as the acceleration of AI and other technologies increases, the pace of job elimination in other industries/trades/professions will also increase. And of course the more jobs that are eliminated, the harder it will be for those who lost those jobs to find different ones. (For a while, there will be jobs to be had in robot/technology design, development, implementation, and maintenance. But eventually those jobs will also be handled by tech, and most of those will require advanced skills not easy to find in the general populace).  \n\nSo the unemployment rate will start to grow, straining governments\' resources. The upper class will continue to grow richer due to the cost savings allowed by such automation, and the lower class will be in for bad times. And, more to the point, the size of that lower class will grow. When that lower class gets big enough and the hopelessness gets overwhelming, there will be massive, widespread riots. That is beginning of the ""adjustment period"" I mentioned. If society survives that, it\'ll be in for a pretty neat time. \n\nOne way to avoid, or at least soften, that adjustment period is to spread some of the gains of automation to those directly impacted by it. And do you think, for example, that XYZ trucking company is going to willingly give meaningful amounts of help to the drivers it kicks to the curb once it\'s fully automated? Some firms might, but history suggests that most companies of any size are laser focused on profits (and not just profits, but infinitely growing profits) and to hell with whatever stands in the way of that goal). \n\nBut, as ZZ Top said, ""But now, I might be mistaken""', 'A long time ago the first economy was created and a single person did 1 unit of work.\n\n\nFast forward to the bronze age. Human efficiency went up with the invention of tools and larger scale (1 person managing providing food for more than 1 person) agriculture, meaning that people didn\'t have to purely subsist on their own.\n\n\n\nFast forward to the iron age. We\'ve got 1 person doing more units of work. Renaissance, we\'re starting to mechanize. 1 person can do far more units of work than a subsistence hunter.\n\n\nIndustrial revolution adds a bigger multiplier to a single laborer\'s output and eliminates many of the old ways of doing things. Electrification (lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration) increases the hours we can work, the times/seasons and places we can work in and further increases that multiplier. One farmer w/ machinery can easily manage well over 500 acres at least compared to the 10-ish acres a bronze age subsistence farmer could manage.\n\n\nComputer age, we increase that multiplier but it\'s probably still in the hundreds. Where a single person can generate several hundred times more wealth than a subsistence farmer. Now we\'re moving into the AI age, where that multiplier isn\'t going to be ""500x"", it\'s going to be one person able to do the labor and generate the wealth of thousands if not tens of thousands of laborers simply by owning the robots and the AI to do so.\n\n\nSo, guarantee a minimum standard of living as I previously said and support entrepreneurship, small businesses, arts and expression, etc. It\'s a novel problem requiring novel solutions that can\'t be fully answered in a Reddit thread.', ""> I need money for bills and food.\n\nIf AI and robots are capable, then no, not really... they provide the work, which reduces the costs to near zero.\n\nReally, this is the beginning phase of robot slavery... hopefully they won't mind."", ""Most people opposing AI are only opposing it being trained on human work without the person's permission, which is more than fair.\n\nThe other aspect is simply putting in regulations so that we roll out these AI replacements in a controlled manner instead of just letting it absolutely flip society upside down without any safety nets. AI replacing most technical and many art jobs but not being anywhere close enough to replacing most physical labor jobs is a terrifying reality to be confronted with. We have to ensure we're implementing AI robotics that can actually provide resources and labor to provide service and care for society so that jobs losses aren't as much of an issue.""]"
"['We\'re so far off from real AI and this tech being branded as AI by tech investors is highlighting even more how extremely far off we are. These are just your typical smart tools that make tasks easier and cut out some grunt work. There\'s limits to what they can do but their existence only increases the ouput and demand for what they assist with reshuffling things but ultimately still requiring plenty people to function, potentially requiring more as they cause growth in the respective industry. \n\nThe dream being sold is that they can fire everyone and tell a robot to do the thing. All because it\'s being branded as AI and associated with AI. When photoshop made a smart brush and then made it smarter no one thought robots would replace photographers. But that is essentially what is being said about the ""AI"" that is replacing these jobs.', 'I think you\'re confused thinking that it\'s one or the other. Programming, writing, and art all have both objective measures of quality and subjective measures. Trivial examples of objectivity include photorealism for art, grammar for writing, and code that compiles. But more complex examples exist, some of which is taught in classrooms and some of which is indescribable but an AI will pick up on its own anyways.\n\n\nI\'m a programmer by trade so that\'s what I know best with regards to what\'s objective or subjective in my field. Experimenting with ChatGPT, my personal experience is that it\'s not bad at all at understanding requirements, and suffers more from hallucinations, forgetfulness, focus, etc. For any sizeable program, most of what it writes will fail to compile or meet the requirements it itself is already capable of writing.\n\n\nThere\'s a lot of objectivity in programming. On my current team our product is effectively just an extremely massive database. The user requirements for a similar product built from scratch would be trivial compared to the codebase I have to work with. I believe most programming is objective or so trivially subjective that AIs have already reached that level (""it\'s my personal opinion that the add to cart button should actually work when I click on it"", etc.).\n\n\nAnd often these programs themselves are just built to service an even simpler set of requirements. There are entire industries dedicated to management software for factories, but if all the workers get replaced with robots there\'s really no point to a beautiful or intuitive UI anymore. The AI can just focus on the simple task of ""make more paperclips"".\n\n\nEDIT: Programming didn\'t even really exist a century ago. Suffice it to say that programming *as an art form* is not necessary for a society to thrive.', 'You aren\'t doing Woke AI (also WAIfu I just thought of that, its mine no one else can have it) justice by just saying ""Capitalism but with AI,"" the potential is far, far greater.

And all managed by networks of complex machines designed for their tasks. Work and jobs and even money and all the shit everyone seems to think are permanent fixtures of human life are no longer necessary.\n\nSo don\'t stop dreaming at ""Capitalism + AI"" because there\'s so much more potential beyond clinging to a fundamentally corrupt system.

So we've been expecting AI to inevitably clean house and dwindle blue collar work down to nothing. But now we've seen that automation can be programmed to not only take care of back office work (digital automation rapidly taking care of basic admin tasks) and retail and food service jobs (kiosks, self-checkout, etc.), it can also be used to diagnose diseases accurately, create art, create believable written content, pass the bar, the list goes on.
