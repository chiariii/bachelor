Hey Redditors ,I came through this news and changed the mindset of mine regarding robotics .

What do you  think about whether industrial robots are going to be efficient and will give an effortless future or we have to face such workplace incidents?

Are robots going to be a better option or a failure?"
Why we may need to rely on robot surgeons in the future?
"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

"How Are Linear Actuators Improving the Aerospace Industry?The aerospace industry uses high-performance mechanisms capable of working under non-standard conditions. Linear actuators designed for use in airless space best suit the requirements of aircraft equipment components. They provide smooth 2D or 3D movement of various elements of a spaceship or airliner: starting from pilot seats and ending with flight control systems.

## Industrial Linear Actuators: Revolutionary

Industrial actuators have drastically changed the processes of production mechanization, the technology for creating and operating automatic lines, and the automation of production processes. The scale of these changes is comparable to the move from the era of steam and coal to the era of electricity. With the evolving technologies and capabilities of linear actuators, they have made previously complex, time-consuming, and perhaps dangerous processes extremely easy. Operating them is easy; they can have a built-in or an external controller, controlling several electric drives or robots on a local network. Industrial automation starts with linear actuators, and their advanced technology has made things a lot more convenient, with the aerospace industry being no exception.

https://preview.redd.it/z7tr77w1vg551.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84b63f510d2030f369b5aa5586767795461d3fa1

 

## Aerospace Actuators

Most systems used in the aviation industry are controlled through drives. For instance, they are often used to control and limit engine speed by adjusting the craft’s levers and flaps.  Actuators convert electrical signals into mechanical motion or other physical variables (such as pressure or temperature); thus, they play an extremely active role in the control systems. For some areas, aviation included, it is important that the drives achieve extremely high dynamic loads while staying lightweight. The ability of actuators to be installed in small, limited spaces is of high significance to this industry. Furthermore, they must also be able to withstand harsh conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme heat, and cold. For instance, our [PA-13](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-13/) has a force capability of up to 3000 lbs, with an environmental rating of IP66. This is the type of actuator that would be suited towards the aerospace industry; however, purchasers need to be mindful of its operating noise rating of <90 dBA.

The production of components for the aerospace industry is focused on mechanical strength and reliability, high load capacity, compactness, and weight reduction. Components designed for aircraft interior solutions must be quiet, run smoothly, and be easy and convenient in use. For example, the inline actuator for controlling an aircraft engine is fully adapted to working in all ranges of torque and applied force. It provides full integration of the actuator with the flight control system of the aircraft.

## Aerospace Actuators and Rocket Launches

Aerospace actuators provide rocket launch and flight control in multiple areas of manufacturing and design. With the recent launch of the NASA and SpaceX rocket, it’s quite interesting to see how [linear actuators](https://www.progressiveautomations.com/collections/linear-actuators) play a role in this. Below are some of the areas where they are implemented: 

* Changing the position of the rails and shanks of launch vehicles, tactical and strategic missiles.
* Controlling the angle of rocket engine nozzles.
* Moving platforms and compartments.
* Crew seat adjustment.
* Maintenance before flight starts. 

## How to Choose an Aircraft Actuator?

Linear actuator manufacturers offer all kinds of aerospace linear actuators to meet the variety of demands and requirements. When choosing actuators, customers in the aerospace and aircraft industry should consider the following: 

* **The stroke length**. Aerospace hydraulic actuators have a stroke length between a few inches and 20 feet. However, the stroke length of industrial electric linear actuators, unlike hydraulic and pneumatic ones, has neither minimum nor maximum limits.
* **Review supporting devices and accessories required.** For instance, a special mounting bracket is used for stationary installation when the linear drive is used only to act on a single element of the mechanism. A double hinge is necessary to ensure that the drive rotates when pulling in and out.
* **Should your actuator have feedback capabilities?** Feedback drive models are capable of synchronizing several flight control parts, and controlling and adjusting the position and speed of the aircraft.
* **Protection rating.** Your linear actuator manufacturer should offer models with high protection for wet and/or dusty environments.

## The Advantages of Electric Linear Actuators Compared to Hydraulic and Pneumatic

Ball-screw gears, hydraulic, and pneumatic linear actuators are being replaced with electric linear motors, an actuator with a linear servo that guarantees exceptional accuracy of movement at various speeds. In cases where you need to significantly reduce the duration of the working cycle, a linear electric motor is a prime choice, with its working acceleration (deceleration) reaching 3G. This is significantly more than what a conventional linear ball screw, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators can cope with.

## Conclusion

For most aspects of the aerospace industry, we recommend [super-powerful actuators](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-17/) that can work with a force of up to 10 pounds and/or a stroke of 0.24 – 60 inches. If you need to use micro or miniature models of industrial linear actuators with a power of only 5 pounds, we will find the right model for you. Progressive Automations has been continuously developing its electromechanical actuator for industries such as the aerospace industry. We are actively collaborating with leading aerospace companies, manufacturers of passenger seats for aviation, as well as supplying our products to manufacturers of special vehicles and equipment for airports.

Alongside their use in the aerospace industry, electric linear actuators can also be found in the following industries and areas: 

* service robots for education and the entertainment industry;
* drives for hospital beds;
* [adjustable office desks](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-category/table-lifts/);
* the building of [humanoid robots](https://progressiveactuators.com/blog/most-human-like-robots/);
* [agricultural production automation](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-industry/agricultural/)."

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found value in it!

"Robotic Process Automation: A Revolution in Process Automation 

In this age of tremendous technological innovations, automation seems  to attract experts to turn business more efficient and rapid. In  precise, [Robotic Process Automation](http://www.athenagt.com/roboticprocessautomation)  attracts organizations as an emerging technology which automates  tedious process of employees. This robust technology lets workforce to  concentrate on higher value work and speeds up the process. Adapting RPA  technologies in certain business processes, companies gain efficiencies  and reduce costs.

[Robotic Process Automation remarkably has the potential to transform industries. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/robotic-process-automation-a-revolution-in-process-automation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20remarkably%20has%20the%20potential%20to%20transform%20industries.&via=@AthenagtLtd&related=@AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/robotic-process-automation-a-revolution-in-process-automation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20remarkably%20has%20the%20potential%20to%20transform%20industries.&via=@AthenagtLtd&related=@AthenagtLtd) 

Imagine the performance of a business application modified with RPA,  it’s beyond your expectation. This is an intelligent automation process  which uses self-learning techniques by incorporating predictive and  cognitive computing. It reduces errors, minimizes human intervention in  process and also lessens irregularity in automated workflows. Although  enterprises stay abreast of new technologies, the trend continues with  integration of various work models.

**RPA, An impeccable technology in present digital-first age**

Concept of RPA can be explained as, software agents called “bots” are  programmed to perform iterative and monotonous, rules-based tasks that  are done by humans earlier. Such bots accomplish tasks such as handling  queries, transactions, manipulating data and log maintenance faster with  utmost accuracy. RPA is compatible with many applications like HTML,  .NET, and JAVA.

**What makes RPA stand out among different automation processes?** 

Besides the ability to perform repeatable tasks, it encompasses  cognitive intelligence. It uses AI, machine learning and speech  recognition, from that evolves self-learning bots having the ability to  analyse situations and correct faults. RPA tools like Blue Prism,  Automation Anywhere, UiPath and OpenSpan are used to automate certain  business processes. Programed bots using RPA tools has the ability to  manage and operate the data by interacting with various digital  integrations.

**RPA with Machine learning and Artificial intelligence**

RPA can automate certain process but its ability gets limited if it  involves decision making which requires application knowledge. ML comes  to use in this scenario, it helps construct a learning base dependent on  chronicle information and utilizes it for decision making and  forecasts.

Symbiosis of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capacities  advance business processes executed by RPA systems in better decision  making and efficient outputs. The data generated by RPA tools powers  AI’s analytical ability to attain profound understanding, which in turn  expands RPA adoption.

The combination of ML and RPA can make automation powerful. ML being  an emerging technology requires experts having deep knowledge abilities  to develop error-free ML models. RPA deployment being customer centric,  enterprises can adapt intelligent automation solutions that in turn  result in ROIs along with ML and AI.

**The utilization of RPA upgrades quality and limits the chance of errors**

As indicated by the RPA specialists, this innovation is sufficient to  change company’s perpetual work style and enables genuine satisfaction  to clients. There is zero chance of monotonous chores, business costs  are decreased and the workforce is occupied with more essential  undertakings and it upgrades the efficiency of the business. The outcome  of RPA is an extensive variety of new potential outcomes and upgraded  business esteem as far as process duration decrease, versatility,  development and continuous efficiency gains.

Athena is evolving as an RPA solution provider, it has automated  various processes for its clients. Its RPA team gives reasonable  responses to all the inquiries. It holds significant involvement in  working with diverse domains including healthcare, insurance, banking  and finance etc. Athena is the ultimate stop to gain more RPA knowledge  and our industry experts provide help in identification of use case and  deployment of RPA technology.

"List of jobs most in decline due to automationEvery March, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases a detailed table of employment by occupation for the previous May. They study May because it's not significantly affected by seasonal employment, and they release in March because, like with any survey, in order to get a representative sample of small subsets of the population, you have to survey a very large number of people. By March, the BLS will have run 10 surveys of 145,000 businesses each and will have asked about May each time. Still, a 35% rise in private chefs from 400 to 540 people could just be statistical noise, so I'll ignore the truly tiny occupations.

The 2013 table will come out this March, but I've used a database to cross-reference the [2010 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2010/may/oes_nat.htm) and [2012 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2012/may/oes_nat.htm) to try to find which jobs are losing the most workers, and to try to determine which declines may be due to automation.

Between 2010 and 2012, total US employment rose from 127 million to 130 million workers, or 2.51%. So anything not rising by 2.51% is falling behind.

Here are the occupations that stood out to me as likely affected by automation, by percentage of job loss from 2010 to 2012. This list primarily focuses on jobs affected by computerization and digitization rather than robotics. This is because jobs currently affected by robotics are largely in manufacturing, but since manufacturing is returning to America as robotics slashes manufacturing labor costs, American manufacturing employment is actually up even though the number of people required to manufacture, say, a set volume of textiles has [fallen by over 90 percent](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html) since 1980. There's a predictable theme of all manner of office administrators and bookkeepers being replaced by software, with many computer workers, people who thought they had learned the skills of the future, simply being replaced by computers outright. Remember that these changes are over just a two-year timespan.

    Cashiers                        -1.20%  -40,160

Feel free to ask about any of these occupations and how they're being automated. The biggest decline in sheer numbers is among executive secretaries and administrative assistants, down by 329,000 workers, a 29% fall, in just two years. In fact, this category has declined by 47% since 2007, as software is being used to automate these job functions away.

There's also a very large number of traditional trades that would overwhelm the list, but that no one is surprised are in decline, such as woodworkers and hand sewers. Many occupations in government, especially teachers, are in decline, as many governments have pursued an austerity strategy. The real estate and construction trades fell, since housing didn't really start rising again until 2013. Entertainment jobs are also down as entertainment goes digital and production goes international. Some jobs are simply evolving or being reclassified, such as computer programmers (-5.04%) becoming app developers (+17.44%), home health aides (-14.54%) becoming personal care aides (+43.61%), or telecom line installers (-14.91%) becoming cell tower installers (+64.55%), which was the second-fastest growing occupation on the list in percentage terms. Number 1 was models (+324.51%), but there are only 4,330 people classified as models, up from just 1,020, so statistical noise could be a factor. Another interesting shift is from chief executives (-6.42%) to general managers (+11.20%). General managers includes small business owners. Corporate consolidation could be a factor there.

The fastest growing umbrella categories of occupations by sheer numbers were food prep and serving (+519,540), sales (+397,110), and personal care (+385,530), with the great majority of the growth in the last category being from elderly care.

As /r/Automate has detailed, there are a lot of technologies ready to attack the food prep and serving category, from [tablet ordering at the table](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/03/tablets_at_restaurants_applebee_s_chili_s_race_to_eliminate_human_interaction.html) to [automated assembly-line kitchens](http://www.gizmag.com/hamburger-machine/25159/) to [vending machines that cook meals](http://www.letspizza.co.uk/) to 30-minute drone delivery to the home a la [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011).

As for elder care, many robots are in development to take care of the elderly, including robots that [monitor vital signs, detect falls, remind people to take medicine, find people who wander](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_o7bFbzMRM#t=27), [transport linens, serve refreshments, provide entertainment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx0zxr3D_zU), even [provide companionship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46sEGwiVO18). But given population trends, even if robots do address elder care, the sheer increase in demand from demographics could help protect workers in this field.

That leaves sales. The main growth here is in retail salespersons, which excludes cashiers, an occupation in decline. The BLS description of a retail salesperson is that they ""sell merchandise, such as furniture, motor vehicles, appliances, or apparel to consumers."" Furniture, cars and appliances are among the goods least conducive to online sales: They're expensive purchases that people want to examine in person before departing with large sums of cash, they're heavy products that are costly to ship, and the prospect of packing up and returning them if you're dissatisfied is daunting. But auto sales could decline as cheap or even [free self-driving taxis](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/google-patents-ad-powered-taxi-service-that-would-offer-free-rides-to-shoppers/) turn the car from a major purchase into an affordable service that arrives at your door. As for clothing, people want to try on clothes before they buy them. There are some businesses that try to work around this, whether by photographing you and creating a virtual fitting room or by sending you a large selection of clothes to try on and charging you only for what you don't return. But perhaps the most promising effort to automate clothing retail is a store that uses [hidden robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KSw28CnRhY) to replace a lot of the retail workforce. Most of the rest of the increase in the sales category is in a vague ""sales representatives, other"" category. My guess is that pharmaceutical reps, among other B2B reps, could hold a significant share of these jobs, but I simply don't know.

The three largest occupation umbrella categories in 2012, regardless of growth, are office and administrative support, sales, and food prep and serving. I've addressed those, but the fourth largest category is interesting: transportation and material moving. The 8.8 million workers in this category are likely in serious jeopardy from self-driving vehicles and robotic machinery that can handle freight.

You can parse the data yourself [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWPO6GB3DyjdFZuanFFNlJRSVhISkphRXNCUFNFTkE&usp=sharing#gid=0). You can download or copy the data to sort or otherwise manipulate it. And again, feel free to discuss and debate individual jobs and their vulnerability to automation.

**EDIT:** Removed several occupations after closer examination suggested they may be affected by reclassification."
"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

📝 Editorial 

The recent emergence of pre-trained language models and transformer architectures pushed the creation of larger and larger machine learning models. Google’s BERT presented attention mechanism and transformer architecture possibilities as the “next big thing” in ML, and the numbers seem surreal. OpenAI’s GPT-2 set a record by processing 1.5 billion parameters, followed by Microsoft’s Turing-NLG, which processed 17 billion parameters just to see the new GPT-3 processing an astonishing 175 billion parameters. To not feel complacent, just this week Microsoft announced a new release of its DeepSpeed framework (which powers Turing-NLG), which can train a model with **up to a trillion parameters**. That sounds insane but it really isn’t.  

What we are seeing is a consequence of several factors. First, computation power and parallelization techniques have evolved to a point where it is relatively easy to train machine learning models in large clusters of machines. Second and most importantly, in the current state of machine learning, larger models have regularly outperformed smaller and more specialized models. Knowledge reusability methods like transfer learning are still in very nascent stages. As a result, it’s really hard to build small models that can operate in uncertain environments. Furthermore, as models like GPT-3 and Turing-NLG have shown, there is some unexplainable magic that happens after models go past a certain size.

Many of the immediate machine learning problems might be solved by scaling the current generation of neural network architectures. Plain and simple, when it comes to machine learning, size matters.  

We would love to hear your opinions about the debate between broader-larger vs. smaller and more specialized models.

"I do not believe automation will result in job loss, or create a society free of labor.This will be very similar to my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/20ffzm/i_believe_the_coming_automation_revolution_where/) in /r/changemyview which I made a few months ago:

People here, and on reddit in general, seem to believe that the job loss created by automation will result in some sort of great systemic change that will result in the creation of a society where people generally won't have to work, and will have great amounts of leisure. Time after time when this is discussed, this conclusion seems to pop up. Which is funny, because to me it doesn't seem very valid at all, for one very important reason-the problem of scarcity.

People will always want more. To put things in perspective, imagine the worries of the average peasant before the Industrial Revolution, and an average person in a modern economy today. The latter is alien to the former: the peasant would mostly be concerned about rainfall, crops, bugs, etc. His idea of a perfect world would be one in which abundant amount of crops could be produced with hardly any effort, and where he could have ample time for leisure. Well, that time is now. In the U.S. right now, less than 2 percent of the population works in agriculture, and yet enough food is produced for the U.S. to actually be a net exporter of it. And yet, we don't feel like utopians. Why? Simply because we have new wants. I, personally, would find my peasant counterpart's idea of a perfect world to be a hellhole, a place with no modern medicine, modern entertainment, (relatively) clean food or water, ability to travel or vacation, education, books, or internet. The fact of the matter is that we can never be satisfied, and I can guarantee that people in the ""perfect"" society of the future will probably be just as unhappy as us. The moment good change happens, we become accustomed to it, and before you know it we will want more good change. 

It is this problem of scarcity that is the reason why I believe that there will never be a point where humanity won't have to work. When we talk of automation satisfying our desires, we seem to forget that they are only satisfying *our* desires, and not the desires of those in the future who'll be used to it.

Moreover, since we are always discovering new wants, each new leap in technology will result in many more possible industries to satisfy those wants. What new possible industries could come from this automation revolution? Well, I don't know. That's like asking our peasant to predict computers, Internet, cars, films, television, electricity, etc. None of us know what we would want after the automation revolution, since we haven't discovered those wants yet. However, I know new industries will form, since our new wants would require new industries that can't be staffed by computers and robots. Why? Well, any wants that can be fulfilled by computers and robots would have probably been fulfilled already by the computers and robots. You will become accustomed to what is fulfilled already, and will demand more, and new industries will form to meet that demand. And if these new industries are eventually mechanized? Well, the whole process starts over: we discover new wants that can't be fulfilled by current industries the way they are at the time, and new ones form. 

Skeptical of this? Think of the peasant again. He may *believe* that his perfect world will satisfy him, but rest assured it won't. If he keeps up with world developments and lives long enough, then he will soon want the new technologies he reads about-better medicine, improvements in farming technology, new types of crops, and eventually, electricity and a motor car, things he could never have dreamt of when envisioning his perfect world. At any rate, he will take what is easily provided for granted.

Those who believe that machines will eventually do better than humans at ""everything"" simply have a limited scope of what ""everything"" really is, the limited scope same in nature to the peasant's when imagining his perfect world. How could we possibly guess the wants of the people of the future? We don't-rather, we simply take our wants today and blindly assume that they will share them. The problem of scarcity shows that this will not be the case.

There is question of what would happen when machines come to the point when they are virtually indistinguishable from people, and then I simply ask, ""What's the matter, then?"" At that point, we should simply just consider them people, and treat them like us. If they get smarter than us, than we can become smarter than them, too. After all, if something can comprehend something more complex than the human brain, then it can surely comprehend the human brain, and improve it in the same manner it improved the machines. Every step an automaton takes in front of humanity will be easily matched by a step taken by humanity, and for this humans and machines will remain mostly at a state of parity.

At any rate, that's what I believe. Feel free to criticise this as you want."

**Growing Acceptance from Manufacturing Sector to Surge Demand**

Numerous companies from a range of manufacturing sectors are increasing their efforts to achieve labor efficiency and cost effectiveness. Besides, to withstand in a highly competitive landscape, they are shifting focus to minimize time required for manufacturing their products. To achieve all these aspects, they are automating numerous production processes in their plants. This move is driving the growth of the global robotic process automation market.

Robotic process automation technologies are known for drastically reducing the time required in the production process. At the same time, they are well known for improving the quality of products by minimizing the probable human errors. These features are estimated to be one of the reasons for outstanding growth of the global robotic process automation market during forecast period.

**Efforts for Utilizing Automation at Its Fullest**

Several companies are shifting toward fully automating their production processes. This shift has led to rise in the need for skilled employees. People with ability to work efficiently in the robotic process automation set-up are in high demand. This situation has compelled vendors to invest in the training of employees to develop industry 4.0 skillsets. Due to all above reasons, training segment from the global robotic process automation market is projected to be one of the prominent segments.

Besides, many vendors are ensuring that they get the best and cost effective technology when they implement robotic process automation. Thus, growing awareness among companies to select from numerous options is boosting demand for consulting services segment of the global robotic process automation market. At present, this segment holds major share of about around 57% in the market. This signifies the strong market position of consulting services as they help organizations in understanding which option best suits their business.

On regional front, North America is projected to maintain its prominent position in the robotic process automation market during forecast period. Key reason behind this consistency is the early acceptance of robotic process automation among vendors in this region. Besides, growing millennial as well as older population in this region is expected to boost the demand for consumer products, which needs speed, precision, and agility in manufacturing. This is spurring the robotic process automation market."
"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning.

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go.

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic.

Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't.

"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

"[Discussion] The Importance of Artificial IntelligenceAlong with machine learning and big data, **artificial intelligence** (AI) has transformed the field of technology in recent years. Despite this, the concept of artificial intelligence is quite vague, and its importance even more so. Some believe that AI may potentially take over the world, while others envision an advanced age powered by automotive cars and robots. Whether it be a dystopia or a futuristic world, the significance of AI is undeniable. What has AI done in recent years, and where is it headed?

Currently, AI is capable of reading, writing, hearing, debating, and even understanding emotions. Algorithms have been shown **outperforming the world’s best** Go and Chess players because of their fast processing speed and ability to store thousands of play variations. AI is already a surprisingly large part of our everyday lives, and here are some examples:

1. The spam filters built within our email systems actually incorporate AI, as spam filters must continually learn from a variety of signals for recognition efficiency. Additionally, it further personalizes the results based on what an individual personally considers spam. Every individual has nuanced methods of categorizing whether something is spam or not, what you consider spam may be beneficial to someone else. With this technology, Gmail successfully [filters 99.9%](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/07/the-mail-you-want-not-spam-you-dont.html) of spam![ ](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/07/the-mail-you-want-not-spam-you-dont.html)
2. The recommendations shopping websites employ for its consumers are also based on their algorithms associating certain products with previous ones that customers may have browsed or purchased. Amazon’s recommendations are heavily personalized to suggest products that are most relevant for their customers to purchase. An astounding [35% of customer purchases](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) are a result of their recommendation engine.[ ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers)
3. In the finance field, banks and corporations have been utilizing AI. Mobile check deposits decipher and convert handwriting into text, which eliminates the need to physically deliver a check. With the sheer number of transactions that occur on a daily basis, AI has also been helpful in detecting and thus decreasing fraudulent activity. 

Therefore, AI has been developed to improve society’s quality of life and automate repetitive tasks that previously required human effort. As the leader of technological growth, AI and its capabilities will lead to further societal progress. In recent years, AI has been instrumental in **analyzing data and integrating information**, which is arguably one of its most essential purposes

"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before— somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"What will be the social implications when *EVERYTHING* is automated in the future?I'm sorry if this question looks like that generic decade old ""how will I make money when robots take my job"" question, but that's not what I'm asking here.
I'm talking about the long term, maybe a century in the future, when the automation, and specially the IT automation are capable of anything we humans do. This is not a moral question about Artificial Intelligence either, but when the AI is so powerful it can literally do every single thing we can apart from emotions (maybe), that is, every single job including creative jobs, when computer will take over not only the assembly line of a factory but the job of engineers, architects, artists, (maybe even programmers?), and they get the capability to do test and research by itself, that is, even scientists won't be needed any longer, then what will there be left for us to DO?
Not talking about money anywhere here, as I believe in the universal wage system (like Finland tried to do), and many other solutions, but I'm talking about the social questions, what the hell are we going to do all day long? Sunbath? Lay in bad and watch movies (made by machines, as actors, directors, even producers will no longer be needed as a single computer can make an entire movie by itself) all day long? Become vegetables? Become stupid because there's no longer a reason to learn physics, chemistry, math, arts, as the machines do EVERYTHING including art and scientific research for us?

I'm sorry if has been asked before but I did not know how to search google for this specific question as everything I searched ended up on the wage problem."

"When will commercial planes fly themselves?I have been contemplating this question for a while now, so I decided to do some research and come up with the best timeline that fits the past and likely future as possible.

I think everyone can agree, *one day* airlines and business jets will regularly fly themselves.  Whether it's 10 years or 1000 years...it will happen.  So the question is, when? I would love your feedback on my estimates!

First, It's nearly impossible to talk about pilot-less planes without talking about driver-less cars.  Eventually, aircraft will have to borrow some of the technology from driver-less cars (such as detecting runway edges, taxiway edges, finding it's way around an airport and park, etc...current aircraft cannot taxi themselves).

Conservative estimates on when we will see truly driver-less cars is around the year 2030, with mass adoption by year 2040.   By 2040, cars should be autonomous for a good 10 years plus, proving the technology. This I would consider the earliest possible truly autonomous airplane. But adoption of the technology this early, I think, is improbable.

http://lesswrong.com/lw/khs/question_driverless_car_forecasts/
http://www.driverless-future.com/?page_id=384

There are many reasons I doubt we will see autonomous commercial aircraft as early as 2040, as there are many technological, practical, and safety hurdles that would need to be addressed.

     Air traffic control systems need to go fully digital first. 

Fully digital en route services are planned to be operational around 2024, and ""D-taxi"" is planned to become operational around the year 2028. Lets add 5 years for good measure and say 2033, and that would be the starting of implementation.  It will have taken 20-some years before all the old ATC equipment has been replaced under the STARS system from 1996 to 2018, so lets add 20 years to the mass adoption of fully digital ATC nationwide. That puts us around 2050.  But that would only be for class B, large international airports.  Until smaller airports are capable of communicating with autonomous aircraft, they would be off limits and would detrimentally limit the benefit of autonomous private/charter aircraft.

http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/tamr/phased-approach/
https://www.aiaa.org/uploadedFiles/Events/Other/Corporate/2013_-_Aerospace_Todayand_Tomorrow/Bradford.pdf

I don't know what to think about smaller towered airports (class D)...as they still do not even require transponder (equipment to communicate information to radar) to be equipped in aircraft; and are not being required to equip with nextgen ADS-B transponder equipment in the future.  Who knows how long class D airports will remain voice/non-digital, but I presume for a very long time. (50 more years/2100?). This would essentially be the end of a simple fun flyer aircraft like a piper cub coming in to a towered airport for some practice landings.  I basically foresee un-controlled airports never allowing for autonomous aircraft to continue allowing hobby flyers.  

I suppose aircraft could be equipped with voice recognition technology to accept clearances eventually, and ground separation could be handled much as driver-less cars.  This means someone like google would have to be contracted by the FAA laser-map every towered airport in the US so the aircraft could navigate on the ground, and the motivation for doing so wouldn't be very strong unless an outside force pushed it.  I imagine taxiing aircraft at smaller airports will be the last thing autonomous airplanes do, and before that happens nearly all commercial aircraft will be semi-autonomous (air-only) first. (See below)

     Obviously, the aircraft needs to be capable of fully autonomous flight.

Well, this is no small hurdle.  First, I am making an assumption that fly-by-wire is a prerequisite. That may seem far fetched for smaller aircraft, but diamond is already testing it on their light twin aircraft, with an emergency auto-land feature in case of pilot incapacitation. This is what I foresee happening with smaller aircraft in the future, they are already single pilot but they will continue become more automated, with complete automation in event the pilot is incapacitated. We have already demonstrated a robot flying an aircraft based on visual cues alone as well.  Let's say around 20 years before this is common on new business aircraft, 2035- right around the time drive-less cars should become mainstream.

http://www.avweb.com/news/features/fly_by_wire_diamond_da42_dries_207846-1.html
http://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-humanoid-robot-can-fly-a-plane-1638047317

Airliners will naturally follow the lead and start producing single-pilot aircraft, capable of semi-autonomous or emergency autonomous flight. Embraer says they are already planning on single-pilot aircraft and claim the technology will be ready around 2025.  Of course, the FAA lags behind so lets give it 10 years, also taking us to 2035 before we start to see the first single pilot airliners.  Another 15 years we would expect all new airliners to be single pilot...2045.

http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/embraer-reveals-vision-for-single-pilot-airliners-343348/

By the year 2040, when all new business aircraft have been presumably semi-autonomous (by this I mean autonomous, but supervised by a pilot) for ten years, I could see that many business owners would be requesting that the FAA issue some kind of semi-autonomous pilots license with reduced training and experience requirements, either to reduce pay/training costs for pilots or to allow owners to operate the aircraft themselves.  Lets give the sluggish FAA 10 years more to make that happen: SAP's (semi-autonomous pilots) are here by the year 2050.  Then SAP's will want planes that can taxi themselves too.  The technology to move on the surface will be borrowed from driveless cars. Someone like Garmin will probably start 3D mapping airports and add the capability and get FAA approval. Give that 10 more years, and we should have truly autonomous *capable* aircraft around 2060 at almost all controlled airports- under most conditions.

What conditions would an autonomous aircraft be bad at?  

The first thing that comes to mind is icing.  Anti-icing could be autonomous with ""hot wings"" (leading edges are hot to prevent ice build up), but the airframe itself can still accumulate excessive ice and needs to be monitored.  Airframe ice detection systems would need to be developed. (they do exist already).  However ground icing would be more critical.  Aircraft cannot have ice adhering to the flight surfaces before takeoff.  It would be impractical to have ice detection probes on every square inch of the aircraft.  Visual is the only way, and I think a human would have to do it, but it could be done remotely via hi-res wing and tail cameras.  Let's give it 10 years before that is all sorted out and approved....2070.

Pre-flight inspections:  In short..some human has to do this for the foreseeable future, until computers exceed the mental capacity of humans...and that is another discussion altogether.  Even if a robot was capable of doing a preflight inspection, I'm going to want to check it out myself.  

Dual engine failures:  In the last 15 years, 3 airliners have had dual engine failures without some kind of cause from the pilots.  Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was the last one to perform the airline ""deadstick"" maneuver, successfully without fatalities in the Hudson river.  I can't think of how a computer would handle this...yes it could be programmed to aim for a river or lake or airport if one is nearby. But what if it has to crash...will it be able to avoid buildings and homes and people?  I could see very small aircraft like an Eclipse or Cirrus Jet automatically deploying a whole-aircraft parachute in such a situation.  But an automated airliner would need to avoid all people and buildings. The only thing I can think of is a remote operator taking the controls in such a situation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_flights_that_required_gliding

Medical emergencies: Especially on an airliner, someone has to be in charge of deciding when a diversion is necessary.  Remote pilot would be the only option.

     Public acceptance/conclusion:

This is maybe the most crucial, especially for airliners.  I think a generation would need to come and go before we go truly autonomous on airliners.  So I'll add 20-70 years to the 2060 date and say 2080 to 2130 the first truly autonomous airliner flies.

"How Are Linear Actuators Improving the Aerospace Industry?The aerospace industry uses high-performance mechanisms capable of working under non-standard conditions. Linear actuators designed for use in airless space best suit the requirements of aircraft equipment components. They provide smooth 2D or 3D movement of various elements of a spaceship or airliner: starting from pilot seats and ending with flight control systems.

## Industrial Linear Actuators: Revolutionary

Industrial actuators have drastically changed the processes of production mechanization, the technology for creating and operating automatic lines, and the automation of production processes. The scale of these changes is comparable to the move from the era of steam and coal to the era of electricity. With the evolving technologies and capabilities of linear actuators, they have made previously complex, time-consuming, and perhaps dangerous processes extremely easy. Operating them is easy; they can have a built-in or an external controller, controlling several electric drives or robots on a local network. Industrial automation starts with linear actuators, and their advanced technology has made things a lot more convenient, with the aerospace industry being no exception.

## Aerospace Actuators

Most systems used in the aviation industry are controlled through drives. For instance, they are often used to control and limit engine speed by adjusting the craft’s levers and flaps.  Actuators convert electrical signals into mechanical motion or other physical variables (such as pressure or temperature); thus, they play an extremely active role in the control systems. For some areas, aviation included, it is important that the drives achieve extremely high dynamic loads while staying lightweight. The ability of actuators to be installed in small, limited spaces is of high significance to this industry. Furthermore, they must also be able to withstand harsh conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme heat, and cold. For instance, our [PA-13](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-13/) has a force capability of up to 3000 lbs, with an environmental rating of IP66. This is the type of actuator that would be suited towards the aerospace industry; however, purchasers need to be mindful of its operating noise rating of <90 dBA.

The production of components for the aerospace industry is focused on mechanical strength and reliability, high load capacity, compactness, and weight reduction. Components designed for aircraft interior solutions must be quiet, run smoothly, and be easy and convenient in use. For example, the inline actuator for controlling an aircraft engine is fully adapted to working in all ranges of torque and applied force. It provides full integration of the actuator with the flight control system of the aircraft.

## Aerospace Actuators and Rocket Launches

Aerospace actuators provide rocket launch and flight control in multiple areas of manufacturing and design. With the recent launch of the NASA and SpaceX rocket, it’s quite interesting to see how [linear actuators](https://www.progressiveautomations.com/collections/linear-actuators) play a role in this. Below are some of the areas where they are implemented: 

* Changing the position of the rails and shanks of launch vehicles, tactical and strategic missiles.
* Controlling the angle of rocket engine nozzles.
* Moving platforms and compartments.
* Crew seat adjustment.
* Maintenance before flight starts. 

## How to Choose an Aircraft Actuator?

Linear actuator manufacturers offer all kinds of aerospace linear actuators to meet the variety of demands and requirements. When choosing actuators, customers in the aerospace and aircraft industry should consider the following: 

* **The stroke length**. Aerospace hydraulic actuators have a stroke length between a few inches and 20 feet. However, the stroke length of industrial electric linear actuators, unlike hydraulic and pneumatic ones, has neither minimum nor maximum limits.
* **Review supporting devices and accessories required.** For instance, a special mounting bracket is used for stationary installation when the linear drive is used only to act on a single element of the mechanism. A double hinge is necessary to ensure that the drive rotates when pulling in and out.
* **Should your actuator have feedback capabilities?** Feedback drive models are capable of synchronizing several flight control parts, and controlling and adjusting the position and speed of the aircraft.
* **Protection rating.** Your linear actuator manufacturer should offer models with high protection for wet and/or dusty environments.

## The Advantages of Electric Linear Actuators Compared to Hydraulic and Pneumatic

Ball-screw gears, hydraulic, and pneumatic linear actuators are being replaced with electric linear motors, an actuator with a linear servo that guarantees exceptional accuracy of movement at various speeds. In cases where you need to significantly reduce the duration of the working cycle, a linear electric motor is a prime choice, with its working acceleration (deceleration) reaching 3G. This is significantly more than what a conventional linear ball screw, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators can cope with.

## Conclusion

For most aspects of the aerospace industry, we recommend [super-powerful actuators](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-17/) that can work with a force of up to 10 pounds and/or a stroke of 0.24 – 60 inches. If you need to use micro or miniature models of industrial linear actuators with a power of only 5 pounds, we will find the right model for you. Progressive Automations has been continuously developing its electromechanical actuator for industries such as the aerospace industry. We are actively collaborating with leading aerospace companies, manufacturers of passenger seats for aviation, as well as supplying our products to manufacturers of special vehicles and equipment for airports.

Alongside their use in the aerospace industry, electric linear actuators can also be found in the following industries and areas: 

* service robots for education and the entertainment industry;
* drives for hospital beds;
* [adjustable office desks](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-category/table-lifts/);
* the building of [humanoid robots](https://progressiveactuators.com/blog/most-human-like-robots/);
* [agricultural production automation](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-industry/agricultural/)."

"Assuming 'worst case' automation scenarios, how will humans find meaning in productivity? In the 20th century, automation has been successful mostly in eliminating factory line work. This is menial labor that is hard to enjoy or take pride in (I assume).

 But in the 21st century, we're seriously looking at the possibility that work reliant on the human mind will also become obsolete. An example where machines have finally come to thoroughly dominate humans is chess (and example I choose in lieu of actual knowledge work because the objection can be made that a lot of it is dull, routine and just as worthy of elimination as menial labor. Chess is something people do voluntarily.).If chess were a business, there would be no humans in it today because anyone can easily obtain a chess engine that is better than any human in the world. People keep playing human vs human games with the aid of computers (outside of the timed match) but I can't imagine that it feels very good to be extremely talented at something that a computer can do better. 

It may seem to be a far stretch from chess to real world tasks, but the jump from chess to Go also seemed enormous. As recently as early last year, many thought that an AI wouldn't come even close to beating an expert Go player for a long time. Yet here we are. There is work on AI art, AI diagnostic systems, AI induction (like independently postulating Newton's Laws from data), AI design, AI traders, AI CEOs and I imagine many others I either cannot recall at the moment or am unaware of. Surely, not every one of these efforts will succeed within my lifetime but it's possible that a lot of them will bear fruit. Certainly, if you believe claims such as those made by Elon Musk about an AI capable of threatening humanity, then a lot of the aforementioned projects should be no less plausible. 

We can tolerate our physical limitations because we are unique in our mental abilities among animals and robots. But if AI can 'reason' better than we can, if AI can compose better poems than most poets, if AI can make a decade of training obsolete, what will be left other than hedonism? What will be worth striving for? What will we spend thousands of hours perfecting?"

"10 Advantages Of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)At [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/), we provide solutions that integrate [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), with business intelligence software and AI technology to improve various logistics scenarios and enable efficient and flexible operations. With a large portfolio of successful cases, we've listed some of the advantages of [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products).

**1. Tripling the productivity of order fulfillment**

When there are multiple orders received, the [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' system will carry out multi-order picking. It controls the picking robot to carry a corresponded rack with multiple SKUs to the workstation for order picking by workers. Hence, a single pick can fulfill multiple orders. Workers do not have to spend time walking, looking for ordered items, on a specific shelf in scattered locations of the warehouse. Therefore, workers can focus on order picking only. This helps to increase the picking productivity by 300% when compared to the manual operation.

**2. Lower Labor Costs**

[MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' AMR system also enables the optimization of labor. With this system, workers can spend all the working hours focusing on order picking only. When order picking becomes more efficient, it means fewer workers can achieve the same or much higher picking productivity than manual operation. This helps reducing labor costs. 

**3. No Single Point of Failure**

By implementing [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), warehouses can ensure continued operations and mitigate against issues associated with single-point-of-failure, which are common in operations relying on fixed infrastructure e.g operation may shut down when the conveyor belt is broken. If an AMR breaks down, it can be easily fixed and replaced without affecting the operation.

**4. Flexible to Scale Up and Down**

The number of robots as well as hours of work per day can be easily adjusted to meet changes in demand even if there is an unexpected peak or off-peak season. Businesses can now avoid the difficulties associated with finding labor under various peak scenarios and the time associated with hiring and then training new staff. Through real-time monitoring and inventory control, the scheduling of [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can dynamically adjusted following incoming demands. 

It also enables businesses to expand their scale in different stages. For example, deploying automation in one part of the warehouse and automating other parts later by adding more robots for the increasing demand in the future.

**5. Fast deployment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be flexibly implemented without the costs associated with fixed infrastructure. The mobility, autonomy, and size make them easy to implement into the existing warehouse. The infrastructures are required only as simple as five components: robots, workstation, WiFi, Shelf & QR code. Therefore, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be easily installed and can go-live within 1-3 months.

**6. Higher Storage Capacity**

The total number of storage bin locations will increase. As the storage bin locations are customized for specific SKUs, therefore, each bin location can be fully utilized to store the same items. This ensures there is no space being wasted.

**7. More Accurate Operations** 

Errors can have several explanations, however, avoiding them is becoming increasingly important as people have higher demands for faster and accurate services. By deploying [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), you can avoid errors associated with manual operations like stress brought on during peak, new staff, and increasingly difficult logistics scenarios like reverse logistics.

**8. Safer Operations** 

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are designed to work dynamically with their surroundings and are highly responsive. By using built-in sensors, laser scanner, and intelligent algorithms, it can detect workers or obstacles and then adjust the route. This allows for a safe and collaborative environment of AMRs and warehouse workers.

**9. Improve the working environment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)deployment is not simply replacing human works. Workers are still the most essential element in the operation. They are going to equip more skills to control the system and collaborate with the [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products). Therefore, deploying [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)is creating an ergonomic working process for workers and increasing their value to the business. 

**10. Flexible Relocation**

Imagine your warehouse needs to relocate due to costs or changes in business, in that case, moving the warehouse infrastructure can be a struggle and large additional cost may be involved in uninstalling. Unlike fixed infrastructure, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are easy to relocate and can enable a quick transition period.

"Is OpenAI’s Study On The Labor Market Impacts Of AI Flawed?[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/1u0r8jsi1eta1.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13677e6277a704139053b5c9fa97e8031c59d3e2)

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

"Put a team of 10 waterproof humanoid robots on a deserted tropical island. Their mission: Survive on what's available and build a town for future human & robotic inhabitants. How do they accomplish this?[This ""Primitive Skills Survival Challenge"" video inspired me to ask this question.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxobZ8vzAks&list=RDKUd9h2w8nMY)

Sometime in the 2030s or later, a dropship sends 10 waterproof androids to a deserted tropical island & leaves them behind without tools. The mission = test whether they'll thrive from incredibly humble beginnings. (i.e. nearly nothing)

All they have is their vast database of knowledge, especially survival tactics. The SSDs in their heads pack many Wikipedias worth of knowledge. The cutting-edge robotic constructs enable them to work 5x faster than humans.

Arriving at dawn, they start with enough electric charge to survive an entire week. (~168 hours) The humanoid robots must figure out how to harness power from:

* the sun
* the nearby ocean
* the wind
* or maybe a river / brook / stream if found

They have until their batteries deplete, to learn how to build the means to stay powered indefinitely, from the island's resources.

Afterwards, they'll set out to build backup batteries.

* How do they build the initial survival tools to stay powered?
* How will the robots build a survival village starting with nothing but themselves & their knowledge? If the robots are not to stop building once they've built survival structures, how would it soon grow into a full city for robots & humans alike?

I posted to /r/automate because I'd like to understand a scenario that depicts an automation of AI's survival. I'm also posting to /r/Robotics because I think someone from there can also chime in, as it is very much another relevant sub.

The parameters do not include cannibalizing fellow droids for their parts. No survival TV show would depict human survivors killing another for shaping their bones into tools, etc.; well, the idea of cannibalizing the parts of other droids would disturb me too.

Moreover, a super-reasoning team of androids would figure out far better solutions than to parts-cannibalize far sooner than we could.

---

The only non-android components that will be drop-shipped in with the androids will be 5 live-streaming cameras through a satellite feed - each one filming in each direction towards the settlement the androids are building, and one that films from overhead - either from a drone or hung from a tree or other tall object close to the settlement. 

The cameras will all have batteries also lasting a week, and may even be solar-charged if the androids build a solar charger for themselves and the cameras. 

This is so that a survival reality show can be live-filmed in order to show the world what happens if we let androids build a settlement completely from scratch."
"How close or far are we from getting robots that can viably replace musical instrumentalists?This is a different question from robots replacing all musicians, which encompasses instrumentalists, arrangers, and composers.

Outside of some genres such as jazz that rely on heavy improvisation, many musicians are playing pieces that have already been written. Even jazz usually sticks with a chord progression, and its improvisation has [potential to be computer generated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VTI1BBLydE). No matter how skilled a player may be, it seems to me that robots will have much greater potential, with many more ""fingers"", much greater ""lung"" capacity, and no errors. As such, I think that it would be possible in the future to replace instrumentalists with them, and music jobs will be narrowed down to those who require much more creativity that can't be programmed too easily, such as creating new styles and genres. I imagine that there are already a good number of composers who can create great pieces but can't play any instrument at all, but this would become even more a thing in the future.

Technologies for [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xlm8LFImno) and [saxophone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjONQNUU8Fg) already seem to be getting there, whereas [violin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ_NF4J5W6s) is still in the beginning stages.

Live music may retain its instrumentalists because it seems to be a socio-cultural phenomenon that's more than just the music itself. It's also just cool to see novelty acts such as trying to beat the world record for guitar shredding speed. However, I magine that their industrial viability may be reduced.

How far are we from having robots that can replace human studio musicians to play, from simple backing tracks to complex classical or metal music? What is the view of the music industry on this?"

"Put a team of 10 humanoid robots on a deserted tropical island. Their mission: Survive on what's available and build a town for future human & robotic inhabitants. How do they accomplish this?[This ""Primitive Skills Survival Challenge"" video inspired me to ask this question.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxobZ8vzAks&list=RDKUd9h2w8nMY)

A dropship sends 10 humanoid robots to a deserted tropical island & leaves them behind without tools. The mission = test whether they can thrive from an incredibly humble beginning (i.e. virtually nothing.)

All they have is their vast database of knowledge, especially survival tactics. Many Wikipedias' worth of knowledge is packed into the SSDs in their heads.

They arrive at dawn. They start with enough electric charge to survive until dusk. The humanoid robots must figure out how to harness power from the sun, the nearby ocean, and maybe a river / brook / stream if they find one. They have until their batteries run down, to figure out how to stay powered indefinitely. They also set out to build backup batteries.

How do they go about building initial survival tools to keep powered on?

How will the robots build a survival settlement starting with nothing but themselves & their knowledge? If the robots are not to stop building once they've built survival structures, how would it soon grow into a resort town for robots & humans alike?

Moreover, when they construct all survival structures & a resort, what'll you see built in:

* 1 hour
* 3 hours
* 6 hours
* 12 hours
* 1 day
* 3 1/2 days
* 1 week
* 2 weeks
* 1 month

"A Detailed RPA Implementation ApproachRobotic Process Automation is growing exponentially as it is driving a massive increase in productivity within the organization. With the minimal upfront investment, it focuses on delivering advantages to a diverse range of departments when implemented.

From multiplying the staff productivity to the utilization of information efficiently, RPA is helping enterprises automate almost every task. Here check out this easy 3 step [RPA implementation plan](https://www.signitysolutions.com/blog/rpa-implementation-guide/?utm_source=Infographic&utm_medium=RPAImplementationGuide&utm_campaign=).

"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before— somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

As /u/ksblur said:

"Only One 2020 Presidential Candidate Has Warned America about Automation  

Martin Ford is a technology expert and writer whose 2015 book [**Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future**](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Robots-Technology-Threat-Jobless/dp/0465059996/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) woke up a lot of people about the fundamental changes automation will bring to the workplace and employment economy.

"List of jobs most in decline due to automationEvery March, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases a detailed table of employment by occupation for the previous May. They study May because it's not significantly affected by seasonal employment, and they release in March because, like with any survey, in order to get a representative sample of small subsets of the population, you have to survey a very large number of people. By March, the BLS will have run 10 surveys of 145,000 businesses each and will have asked about May each time. Still, a 35% rise in private chefs from 400 to 540 people could just be statistical noise, so I'll ignore the truly tiny occupations.

The 2013 table will come out this March, but I've used a database to cross-reference the [2010 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2010/may/oes_nat.htm) and [2012 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2012/may/oes_nat.htm) to try to find which jobs are losing the most workers, and to try to determine which declines may be due to automation.

Between 2010 and 2012, total US employment rose from 127 million to 130 million workers, or 2.51%. So anything not rising by 2.51% is falling behind.

Here are the occupations that stood out to me as likely affected by automation, by percentage of job loss from 2010 to 2012. This list primarily focuses on jobs affected by computerization and digitization rather than robotics. This is because jobs currently affected by robotics are largely in manufacturing, but since manufacturing is returning to America as robotics slashes manufacturing labor costs, American manufacturing employment is actually up even though the number of people required to manufacture, say, a set volume of textiles has [fallen by over 90 percent](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html) since 1980. There's a predictable theme of all manner of office administrators and bookkeepers being replaced by software, with many computer workers, people who thought they had learned the skills of the future, simply being replaced by computers outright. Remember that these changes are over just a two-year timespan.

Feel free to ask about any of these occupations and how they're being automated. The biggest decline in sheer numbers is among executive secretaries and administrative assistants, down by 329,000 workers, a 29% fall, in just two years. In fact, this category has declined by 47% since 2007, as software is being used to automate these job functions away.

There's also a very large number of traditional trades that would overwhelm the list, but that no one is surprised are in decline, such as woodworkers and hand sewers. Many occupations in government, especially teachers, are in decline, as many governments have pursued an austerity strategy. The real estate and construction trades fell, since housing didn't really start rising again until 2013. Entertainment jobs are also down as entertainment goes digital and production goes international. Some jobs are simply evolving or being reclassified, such as computer programmers (-5.04%) becoming app developers (+17.44%), home health aides (-14.54%) becoming personal care aides (+43.61%), or telecom line installers (-14.91%) becoming cell tower installers (+64.55%), which was the second-fastest growing occupation on the list in percentage terms. Number 1 was models (+324.51%), but there are only 4,330 people classified as models, up from just 1,020, so statistical noise could be a factor. Another interesting shift is from chief executives (-6.42%) to general managers (+11.20%). General managers includes small business owners. Corporate consolidation could be a factor there.

The fastest growing umbrella categories of occupations by sheer numbers were food prep and serving (+519,540), sales (+397,110), and personal care (+385,530), with the great majority of the growth in the last category being from elderly care.

As /r/Automate has detailed, there are a lot of technologies ready to attack the food prep and serving category, from [tablet ordering at the table](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/03/tablets_at_restaurants_applebee_s_chili_s_race_to_eliminate_human_interaction.html) to [automated assembly-line kitchens](http://www.gizmag.com/hamburger-machine/25159/) to [vending machines that cook meals](http://www.letspizza.co.uk/) to 30-minute drone delivery to the home a la [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011).

As for elder care, many robots are in development to take care of the elderly, including robots that [monitor vital signs, detect falls, remind people to take medicine, find people who wander](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_o7bFbzMRM#t=27), [transport linens, serve refreshments, provide entertainment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx0zxr3D_zU), even [provide companionship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46sEGwiVO18). But given population trends, even if robots do address elder care, the sheer increase in demand from demographics could help protect workers in this field.

That leaves sales. The main growth here is in retail salespersons, which excludes cashiers, an occupation in decline. The BLS description of a retail salesperson is that they ""sell merchandise, such as furniture, motor vehicles, appliances, or apparel to consumers."" Furniture, cars and appliances are among the goods least conducive to online sales: They're expensive purchases that people want to examine in person before departing with large sums of cash, they're heavy products that are costly to ship, and the prospect of packing up and returning them if you're dissatisfied is daunting. But auto sales could decline as cheap or even [free self-driving taxis](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/google-patents-ad-powered-taxi-service-that-would-offer-free-rides-to-shoppers/) turn the car from a major purchase into an affordable service that arrives at your door. As for clothing, people want to try on clothes before they buy them. There are some businesses that try to work around this, whether by photographing you and creating a virtual fitting room or by sending you a large selection of clothes to try on and charging you only for what you don't return. But perhaps the most promising effort to automate clothing retail is a store that uses [hidden robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KSw28CnRhY) to replace a lot of the retail workforce. Most of the rest of the increase in the sales category is in a vague ""sales representatives, other"" category. My guess is that pharmaceutical reps, among other B2B reps, could hold a significant share of these jobs, but I simply don't know.

The three largest occupation umbrella categories in 2012, regardless of growth, are office and administrative support, sales, and food prep and serving. I've addressed those, but the fourth largest category is interesting: transportation and material moving. The 8.8 million workers in this category are likely in serious jeopardy from self-driving vehicles and robotic machinery that can handle freight.

You can parse the data yourself [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWPO6GB3DyjdFZuanFFNlJRSVhISkphRXNCUFNFTkE&usp=sharing#gid=0). You can download or copy the data to sort or otherwise manipulate it. And again, feel free to discuss and debate individual jobs and their vulnerability to automation.

**EDIT:** Removed several occupations after closer examination suggested they may be affected by reclassification."
"VyrdismI present to you a more focused detailing of my previous words here. Thanks to a guy named Henry Vyrd, the idea behind [technostism](/r/Technostism) has been streamlined greatly, so I can finally convey all I need to say in just a few words.

In honor of him, I've scrapped technostism's original baggage and streamlined *it* down to meaning ""**full workplace automation, or the pursuit of such in the name of profiting directly from automated labor**.""

Now onto [Vyrdism](/r/Vyrdism). 

What plagues society is income inequality, which has reached extreme and unsustainable levels, and the root cause of this is control over business operations. This is why the conservative left has largely failed— they aim for higher taxes on businesses in order to fund welfare, rather than treating the problem at the source.

Vyrd believed that we should create a national networked federation of worker cooperatives. This is meant to compete against *and* cooperate with traditional enterprises. The thinking is that low and middle skilled workers will opt to work at the cooperatives, while higher skilled workers head for the specialized jobs that capitalists offer. Capitalists, meanwhile, will be shocked by the labor flight that occurs and will invest heavily in automation in order to offset the rapid loss of workers. Those who fail to do so will see their businesses bought by workers. This all works to bring the price of automation down to affordable levels— which the worker federation capitalizes upon. The worker cooperatives, too, become automated, and the workers act as the beneficiaries, shareholders if you will. 

Automation becomes cheaper and cheaper until anyone can afford their own personal worker. This breeds [helotism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3v12kx/helotism/) as well, where there exists a large pool of [technotarians](http://technostism.wikia.com/wiki/Technotariat) that are owned in common. Technotarians can be loaned to a person who lacks ownership in order for them to buy a wage-earning robot of their own, and it is through this [seed loan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3f93me/seed_loans_the_solution_to_technological/?ref=search_posts) that any person can become a member of the worker cooperative federation post-technostism.

The helots, since they work for the People, work in order to provide a basic guaranteed income. Helots cannot be loaned to any particular person, and they fulfill State roles.

Eventually, through technotarian ownership, all humans become part of the [networking class](http://technostism.wikia.com/wiki/Networking_class) and an [economically] classless society is achieved, where social class is instead based upon personal merit and talent.

Vyrd said it himself— consider it 'communism via bourgeoisie', where instead of proletarian revolution, we all become capitalists exploiting the labor of robots. In fact, exactly as Marx himself said would happen. Vyrd also went on about abundance and free market socialism and whatnot, but this is the gist of his ideas.

PS: Vyrd was a [Market Technostist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3uzzk8/there_are_already_two_camps_market_technostism/), by far. He never mentioned tax-based UBI because he was actually a conservative libertarian before I described technostism to him. Because Vyrdism is ""Nouveau-Leftist"", it treats the economic conditions with economic action first and puts State action last."
"Anybody working on farming automations? (Or know of one?) /r/farmtechAfter some discussion with others about the increase in automation technologies for farming. I found it hard to find a central place to learn more about opensource farming automations and how it might go when combined with other cutting edge farming technologies like ""vertical farming"".

So /r/farmtech is created to help spur discussion, and hopefully action/research into the future of democratising access to food through open access technologies. 

If you know of any technologies, or opensource projects that we should know of, please subscribe to our subreddit and post a thread on it. I will cross promote this with other subreddits (like /r/farming/ which is full of farmers) in the hope that we can get many people of different skills to work together on this very important field.

http://www.reddit.com/r/farmtech

-----------

If you are actively working on such a project, posting text updates is definitely encouraged. (We are looking more specifically at automation/robotic technology or vertical farming)

Farming automation is really just the next step after the first industrial revolution. It means food security for everyone (As long as it is not centrally controlled)."
"MIT Economist Andrew McAfee: ""This time it's different.""Contrary to the many -- including the folks at Deloitte whose report is on the front page of /r/Automate right now [[link]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/3hhohd/technology_has_created_more_jobs_than_it_has/) -- who believe that technological advancement will, as in the past, continue to increase overall levels of employment across the global economy, Andrew McAfee says: **""This time it's different.""**

Here's an excerpt from his 2013 TED talk:

>Now, for about 200 years, people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you -- the age of technological unemployment is at hand — starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain just about two centuries ago, and they have been wrong. Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment.

>Which brings up a critical question: Why is this time different, if it really is? The reason it's different is that, just in the past few years, our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never, ever had before: understanding, speaking, hearing, seeing, answering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills. For example, mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive, but the research arm of the Defense Department just launched a competition to have them do things like this, and if the track record is any guide, this competition is going to be successful. So when I look around, I think the day is not too far off at all when we're going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now. And we're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs. It's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling ""the new machine age.""

"A questionHello, I have been living on this planet for 18 years now, and am lucky to have been born in a 1st world country. My childhood up until now has been quite great, and technology played a part in the great enjoyment of childhood.

Now its time for me to basically make money, and I have been thinking about automation and technology. 

And it seems to me that one big thing that benefits everybody on this planet are technological advancements. 
So this has led me to learn or study automation or robotics even though I dont know much about it.

I have been training my brain for the past 5 years to be able to play guitar and create music. I may already have put 3000-3200 into it, making music is what my brain has now gotten good at. But I dont think I even deserve to make any money from my music skills (because there is enough supply of music in the market of music ) and making music doesn't actually change anything in the world, it is just soundwaves.

So that has brought me to automation, I think I want to learn how to automate, because I want to create unemployment. The reason for that is, is because how amazing would it be if people could just lay on the grass all day and not be worried that they have to go to their job the next day?

how great would it be if people could just play a game 24 hours in a row, and not worry that they have to go to a job the next day?

I think it would be very great. 

I also think I could potentially earn good money with this, but I dont really know for sure, I am just assuming I hope experienced people in this field can tell me what I can expect, and what degree/study I should choose to be able to do this.

Also, Imagine if everyone on earth focused on automation. Then we would have  a great world much quicker, a easy world, a joyful world.

Thanks in advance"
"Smart Tools and Economic Collapse Humans are the original ""smart tools"". We are able to copy ourselves and pass on our knowledge.  We built other tools using food-powered energy and raw materials from nature. Technologies like automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence are going into new types of smart tools - tools that don't need us any more to do their job. The new smart tools will also be able to copy themselves, pass on their knowledge, and make other tools using energy and raw materials from nature. The problem is our economic system is based on trading our labor for money, then trading that money for the other things we need and want.

 If the owners of the smart tools don't need people to run a business, they will get rid of them as an unnecessary expense. But the people who are unemployed will not be buying the products and services those businesses are selling, so those businesses lose income. They can't afford rent or mortgage payments, so landlords and lenders also lose income. Governments then also lose tax sources based on income, employment, sales, and property. If replacement of people by smart tools becomes widespread, everyone loses.  It leads to recession, depression, or economic collapse of our current system.

 Our tools are only going to get smarter and cheaper with time, but people have a limited ability to improve their skills or learn new ones. So eventually all conventional jobs are at risk from this problem. The question is when, and how do we deal with it?

----

  One answer is to leverage personal production networks and smart tools to solve the very problem they create.

 A personal production network is a distributed group of people.  They create useful products and services for themselves and people outside the network by building and operating their own equipment. They bootstrap from a starter set of skills, knowledge, tools, and resources. They help each other expand and upgrade from where they started. This includes adding new and improved skills; and more information, designs, and plans for their knowledge base. They buy more tools, equipment, and workspaces out of their earnings, or make their own using what they already have. Lastly, they accumulate funding, materials, energy, parts, and other resources to work with. Member goals include meeting most or all of their personal needs, be self-supporting, economically secure, and able to help new people by growing the existing network or starting new ones.

 A fully developed network would be able to make everything members want, including copying all their equipment and supplying new starter sets. A self-contained production chain, from raw materials to finished products, makes self-expansion and upgrade easier and less expensive. ""Smart tools"", which exploit automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence, can grow efficiently with little labor. A new network won't start out with all these abilities, but would grow into them a step at a time.  As owners of the smart tools, they are not at risk from labor displacement.  They still benefit from the tools, no matter how smart they get.

----
The ""Seed Factories"" subreddit has a link to a paper on ""Smart Tools and Self-Expanding Systems"" which goes into more depth on this subject.  It's a fairly long paper, so there is also a shorter slide presentation on ""Maker Networks"" (MakerNets)"" that covers the main points.

"Absolute Abundance— I wish to share with you a flash story about technostism (x-post /r/Technostism)That cool morning in the age of Orwell's Heaven, I ate breakfast, kissed my gynoid, and bought paper. Why not sit down at the table and dream new tales? Writing's easy and cathartic and my passion. And all year round, I would sit there, crafting wonders— making love to empty pages until midnight. Dawnlight starshine over pearl skies was my reward. I felt alive. Droids secured me a fine living. They would labor with the finest accuracy. Fabricators made everything for me freely with precision down to atoms at my leisure. Always high-end, they erased all class divisions. Droids served me well, decorating the finest sweets. They downloaded prior knowledge from their comrades. So they worked with infinite skills for maintenance. My house was cleaned, the roads repaired to perfection. Then when I said, ""Build me new rooms for my newborn,"" they went to work building my house like a mansion.

My gynoid worked as CEO of a business, making millions for me so vicariously. More droids were built to be sold off to networkers. Worker co-ops became technates across the globe. Networkers used and exploited these new age slaves to fix the world and to create fabricators. More built robots to do their work and support them. Droids fixed the parks. Droids fixed all roads. Droids cleaned junkyards— and the forests and the oceans effortlessly. Wealth spread around and there was no more poverty on Earth for good. Failed businesses were nothing more than slight bummers, for one could send droids into the massive workforce for their daily bread and help them try once again.

She has returned into my arms forever more."

How to compete with robots
"RPA (Robotic Process Automation) 

RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is considered a relatively new phase of technology that is already making a significant impact in many industries, including finance and accounting. RPA can help organizations transform their operations by automating routine and repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more value-added activities.

RPA has the potential to significantly improve accuracy and efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the overall customer experience. It can also help organizations better manage their data, allowing for faster and more informed decision-making.

In addition to these operational benefits, RPA also has the potential to drive cultural and organizational change. By automating routine tasks, organizations can create a more agile and flexible work environment that is better equipped to adapt to the ever-changing demands of the business world.

However, it is important to note that RPA is not a one-size-fits-all solution and that proper implementation is key to realizing its full potential. Organizations need to carefully select the processes that are most suitable for automation, provide adequate training and support to end users, and ensure a seamless integration with existing systems and processes.

Overall, RPA is a promising technology that has the potential to drive significant transformation in the way organizations operate and compete in the digital and data-driven world."

"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

As /u/ksblur said: 

> Strange how we live in a world of trust-based security. It would be relatively easy for cryptography to solve that issue (your phone could automatically reject calls without proper signatures or encryption), but  people grew up ""trusting"" the systems so there's not a lot of incentive to change it.

"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before— somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"Manufacturing innovation tips?**How would you go about a project that attempts to innovate and create value in the form of an autonomous warehouse robot concept?**

*It's a project at my university but I feel hopeless insofar as real value proposition. My main goal with this post is to grasp a process/approach that would enable me to make something that, provided a high enough quality, could actually be turned into a real life project worth the resources and be implemented.*

&#x200B;

My elementary (but best) step-by-step approach would look something like this:

* **get to know warehouse operations as much as possible** (it is actually required that I come up with an innovative idea based on a marketing analysis but I don't really see how that helps formulating the concrete idea; in my understanding it might reveal if warehouse automation is a growing market and summarize the environment for developments)
* **investigate unautomated tasks that are possible to automate** *(hopefully there are at least a few)*
* **conduct an analysis that it is possible to produce the concept and assess the production costs** *(not required by uni but if I had a great idea I would, no doubt, do it)*
* **conduct an analysis to find out if the solution is a worthwhile financial investment for warehouses** *(same as with the previous point)*
* **build a prototype** *(requirement from the uni)*

Please prove me wrong and criticize any of my points, but right now I don't see a way of actually finding out a concept worthwhile of real life implementation. Ignore the limitations of my technical competencies to a reasonable extent (I sadly won't be able to create a comprehensive A.I. application that optimizes all warehouses just yet :D) and focus on how you would acquire enough information about warehouses that you create a new valuable automated solution.

*Thanks for reading it and I very much look forward to reading your insights and arguments. I'm really trying to motivate myself with identifying a real goal but I'm doubtful as it just seems too technologically specific of an area to innovate in as an outsider. Nonetheless, it still is my goal.*"
"Know how Financial service providers can transform their core operations using RPA Innovation 

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) on **November 30, 2018** under [**RPA**](http://blog.athenagt.com/category/rpa/)

&#x200B;

To  compete in an undeniably saturated financial industry,  where the  virtual operation adoption is increasing, financial companies need to  stay focused on their end goal. Expectations at customer end could be  hassle-free operations, accessibility, faster responsive, a value from  financial products/services, altogether a delighted client experience.  Expectations at firms end could be improved efficiency, a better  understanding of clientele, maintenance of privacy and security and low  costs.

[Robotic  Process Automation is the ultimate solution to exceed the expectations  at both customer and financial institutions' end. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd) 

Major banks such as Axis Bank and Deutsche Bank have implemented RPA  to automate certain business processes. RPA rapidly reduces costs, time  and staff required for various processes, in which tedious and  rule-based tasks are carried out by programmed “bots“, with reduced  human intervention. Hence, efficiency, accuracy and business operations  of the industry observe a substantial shift.

Financial service providers manage huge customer data and there is a  possibility of human error. By adopting RPA, they can lessen manual  processing and time consumption, maintain accuracy. Software bots have  the ability to perform rule-based logical tasks with human intelligence.  They can bring down the processing time up to 40% and costs up to 80%,  automating certain processes can help staff in engaging with higher  value tasks to shift the operational efficiency.

Let’s look into a few areas of financial institutes, where RPA can be implemented.

# Customer Service

Every financial services company  deals with numerous queries regarding products/services. RPA can be  implemented here, reducing the turnaround time and creating an improved  customer responsive system. Chatbots resolve the queries in real time,  using AI for decision making and NLP to process natural language. With  the help of NLP, Chabot can understand the natural language to  communicate with customer at ease, replacing staff.

# Compliance

Financial institutions, contributing to the economy, has to abide by  compliance. RPA has the ability to fetch and compose data from multiple  channels can improve the efficiency of the companies compliance program,  saving it from risks. It can also be available 24/7 and can streamline  processes like data collection, compilation sorting information and risk  reporting.

# Accounts Payable

Accounts payable is a simple yet repetitive process in banking. The  process involves producing customer information, validation, and process  payment. As this is a rule-based process, RPA can be implemented  undoubtedly in this case. RPA along with the help of optical character  recognition (OCR) facilitates the automation of the above process. OCR  reads the customer information from a scanned copy of the physical form  and feeds it to the RPA system. The system validates the data and  processes the payment. If an error occurs, It can notify the agent on  necessary actions.

# Credit cards and Loan Processing

The conventional credit card and loan application processing is a  time and labor intensive task. This task is tedious to the staff and  also displeasing to the customers, with RPA adoption, banks can swift  this process. RPA system can integrate and communicate with multiple  systems coherently, to fetch and validate the data and uses AI’s  decision making to either approve or reject the application.

# Fraud Detection

Along with the pros, the digital revolution has also brought some  cons and the notable one is FRAUD. Since financial institutions deal  with volume data, it’s hard for them to monitor all the customer  interactions to identify malicious activity. RPA comes to bank’s aid in  such scenarios, RPA deployed system has the ability to identify the  probable fraud transactions, recognizing the logical patterns in  real-time. It also can prevent fraud by notifying the executive/customer  on an unusual transaction.

# KYC Process

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a mandatory process for most of the  financial services companies. If manually done, it requires hundreds of  employees to validate the customer information. According to Thomson  Reuters, banks spend more than $384 million per year on KYC process  compliance. In order to minimize FTEs, reduce costs and to save an  adequate amount of time, the financial service providers are adopting  RPA to their business operations. RPA implementation in such process  minimizes human errors with 100% accuracy.

# General Ledger

To create accurate financial statements, the general ledger must be  updated with information such as revenue, assets, liabilities,  expenses.etc., this information needs to be gathered from different  legacy systems, that needs to be validated before publishing to a  general ledger.

Management of this huge data is prone to errors and inaccuracy.

RPA resolves this complexity, being powerful and technology  independent, it can be integrated with any system to collect data of  multiple formats. This also saves a lot of data handling time and  maintains accuracy.

# Report Automation

Creating an error-free and accurate report consumer a huge amount of  and time and number of employees. But still, doesn’t completely  eradicate the human error. RPA systems can collect data in multiple  formats, create reports by auto-filling the extracted data in the  required format and produce reports without errors at minimal cost and  time.

"VyrdismI present to you a more focused detailing of my previous words here. Thanks to a guy named Henry Vyrd, the idea behind [technostism](/r/Technostism) has been streamlined greatly, so I can finally convey all I need to say in just a few words.

In honor of him, I've scrapped technostism's original baggage and streamlined *it* down to meaning ""**full workplace automation, or the pursuit of such in the name of profiting directly from automated labor**.""

Now onto [Vyrdism](/r/Vyrdism). 

What plagues society is income inequality, which has reached extreme and unsustainable levels, and the root cause of this is control over business operations. This is why the conservative left has largely failed— they aim for higher taxes on businesses in order to fund welfare, rather than treating the problem at the source.

Vyrd believed that we should create a national networked federation of worker cooperatives. This is meant to compete against *and* cooperate with traditional enterprises. The thinking is that low and middle skilled workers will opt to work at the cooperatives, while higher skilled workers head for the specialized jobs that capitalists offer. Capitalists, meanwhile, will be shocked by the labor flight that occurs and will invest heavily in automation in order to offset the rapid loss of workers. Those who fail to do so will see their businesses bought by workers. This all works to bring the price of automation down to affordable levels— which the worker federation capitalizes upon. The worker cooperatives, too, become automated, and the workers act as the beneficiaries, shareholders if you will. 

Automation becomes cheaper and cheaper until anyone can afford their own personal worker. This breeds [helotism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3v12kx/helotism/) as well, where there exists a large pool of [technotarians](http://technostism.wikia.com/wiki/Technotariat) that are owned in common. Technotarians can be loaned to a person who lacks ownership in order for them to buy a wage-earning robot of their own, and it is through this [seed loan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3f93me/seed_loans_the_solution_to_technological/?ref=search_posts) that any person can become a member of the worker cooperative federation post-technostism.

The helots, since they work for the People, work in order to provide a basic guaranteed income. Helots cannot be loaned to any particular person, and they fulfill State roles.

Eventually, through technotarian ownership, all humans become part of the [networking class](http://technostism.wikia.com/wiki/Networking_class) and an [economically] classless society is achieved, where social class is instead based upon personal merit and talent.

Vyrd said it himself— consider it 'communism via bourgeoisie', where instead of proletarian revolution, we all become capitalists exploiting the labor of robots. In fact, exactly as Marx himself said would happen. Vyrd also went on about abundance and free market socialism and whatnot, but this is the gist of his ideas.

PS: Vyrd was a [Market Technostist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3uzzk8/there_are_already_two_camps_market_technostism/), by far. He never mentioned tax-based UBI because he was actually a conservative libertarian before I described technostism to him. Because Vyrdism is ""Nouveau-Leftist"", it treats the economic conditions with economic action first and puts State action last."

Imagine the performance of a business application modified with RPA,  it’s beyond your expectation. This is an intelligent automation process  which uses self-learning techniques by incorporating predictive and  cognitive computing. It reduces errors, minimizes human intervention in  process and also lessens irregularity in automated workflows. Although  enterprises stay abreast of new technologies, the trend continues with  integration of various work models.

**RPA, An impeccable technology in present digital-first age**

Concept of RPA can be explained as, software agents called “bots” are  programmed to perform iterative and monotonous, rules-based tasks that  are done by humans earlier. Such bots accomplish tasks such as handling  queries, transactions, manipulating data and log maintenance faster with  utmost accuracy. RPA is compatible with many applications like HTML,  .NET, and JAVA.

**What makes RPA stand out among different automation processes?** 

Besides the ability to perform repeatable tasks, it encompasses  cognitive intelligence. It uses AI, machine learning and speech  recognition, from that evolves self-learning bots having the ability to  analyse situations and correct faults. RPA tools like Blue Prism,  Automation Anywhere, UiPath and OpenSpan are used to automate certain  business processes. Programed bots using RPA tools has the ability to  manage and operate the data by interacting with various digital  integrations.

**RPA with Machine learning and Artificial intelligence**

RPA can automate certain process but its ability gets limited if it  involves decision making which requires application knowledge. ML comes  to use in this scenario, it helps construct a learning base dependent on  chronicle information and utilizes it for decision making and  forecasts.

Symbiosis of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capacities  advance business processes executed by RPA systems in better decision  making and efficient outputs. The data generated by RPA tools powers  AI’s analytical ability to attain profound understanding, which in turn  expands RPA adoption.

The combination of ML and RPA can make automation powerful. ML being  an emerging technology requires experts having deep knowledge abilities  to develop error-free ML models. RPA deployment being customer centric,  enterprises can adapt intelligent automation solutions that in turn  result in ROIs along with ML and AI.

**The utilization of RPA upgrades quality and limits the chance of errors**

As indicated by the RPA specialists, this innovation is sufficient to  change company’s perpetual work style and enables genuine satisfaction  to clients. There is zero chance of monotonous chores, business costs  are decreased and the workforce is occupied with more essential  undertakings and it upgrades the efficiency of the business. The outcome  of RPA is an extensive variety of new potential outcomes and upgraded  business esteem as far as process duration decrease, versatility,  development and continuous efficiency gains.

Athena is evolving as an RPA solution provider, it has automated  various processes for its clients. Its RPA team gives reasonable  responses to all the inquiries. It holds significant involvement in  working with diverse domains including healthcare, insurance, banking  and finance etc. Athena is the ultimate stop to gain more RPA knowledge  and our industry experts provide help in identification of use case and  deployment of RPA technology.

"PoC for processing utility invoices -> AWS route vs uiPath route - trying to understand high level adv vs disadvantages if someone can help me please So lets say I get 100 invoices every month, these invoices must be properly categorized and relative fields must be uploaded into a db for accountant to post. The system must be able to tell which invoice belongs to which property, what type it is, any minute detail depending on accountants needs must be incorporated. The system will have to reference lookup table to get certain data like account number etc.

Lets assume half of these invoices are unique in the sense that they are different vendors and have different formats. One invoice can have a overdue section from previous bill, then next month not have that, so the system must be able to adapt to changing data. Another invoice can have various fields which another invoice might not.

The current process is done manually - received by mail not email or online copy, and user has to look at each invoice, figure out gl code, etc etc.

Right now I am doing a PoC with AWS reps using textract and python to develop something that can process these invoices. We have the ability to switch over to online pdf copies/email copies instead of doing the scan in manual way.

What I am trying to understand is what kind of advantage something like UiPath or another RPA would give in this process. I believe UiPath uses abbyy OCR, which I don't think is best for my use case because they don't extract in key value pairs like textract does, thus I would have to do more logic implementation just to get the right values with the right keys (right?)

But looking for other positives/negatives so I can do a proper assessment on both tools. Would anyone have experience with UiPath here or any RPA implementation?

Personally I feel like RPA is just good for ""robotic, doesn't change much same steps every time process"" but not sure how well it would do in changing document types and implementing various logic to do what the PoC is doing now. Looking for a high level on adv vs disadv if possible.

"Automating medecineWhat are your thoughts on automating the oldest profession?


What exists already for this, and what would be the implications?


The way i see it, Dr. nowadays depend very largely on electronic support to diagnose, heal, or look up similar symptoms, yet when they get it wrong it's mostly due to the human aspect.


For surgery, manually guided robots are presently used, but it seems like something that could be automated using the same automation strategy used for self driving cars.


The goal here is to make medecine more accessible, to those who can't have it. Eliminate/reduce ""human"" error, and provide faster, more correct diagnosis.


I ask this question because it seems to me today bureaucracy is rapidly creeping in on the north american medical system anyways.

Edit: and this bureaucracy is causing even more human errors by leading doctors to deal with their specialization completely independantly.

"Disruption, automation, and economic uncertainty on the horizonConsider a region of the country where you have a large percent of the population working in a small number of industries; and then imagine what would happen if one of the major industries were to pull out.

Unemployment remained high from 1982 up till about 1985; and surrounding areas got it even worse, as they didn't have a diversity of industries like Pittsburgh proper.  

Detroit is a similar story, although it has had many different problems through the years, besides just the reduction in auto manufacturing jobs:

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/17/us/detroit-decline.html

The coal-producing regions of Appalachia have similarly seen decline, and have had a very hard time recovering.

Farming regions in the early 1900s were also hit hard -- due to automation (tractors and other technology), better farming practices, etc. -- and Joseph Stiglitz has argued that the ensuing collapse in food prices could have been the main catalyst for the Great Depression:

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/01/stiglitz-depression-201201

> What this transition meant, however, is that jobs and livelihoods on the farm were being destroyed. Because of accelerating productivity, output was increasing faster than demand, and prices fell sharply. It was this, more than anything else, that led to rapidly declining incomes. Farmers then (like workers now) borrowed heavily to sustain living standards and production. Because neither the farmers nor their bankers anticipated the steepness of the price declines, a credit crunch quickly ensued. Farmers simply couldn’t pay back what they owed. The financial sector was swept into the vortex of declining farm incomes.

**So:  it's not a given that a particular region will immediately recover and keep unemployment low if a major industry pulls out or automates jobs away.  A lot will depend on the structure of the local economy -- e.g. the diversity of industry present.**

Are there other towns like this waiting to be disrupted by the pulling-out of a major industry or automation thereof?  

Sure there are, if you look at medium-sized towns with about 10,000 people, and broaden ""industry"" to include a whole sector like ""retail"".  Just think of all the towns whose main draw is their Big Box stores (e.g. Walmart SuperCenter).  And now imagine what would happen if almost complete automation of Amazon fulfillment centers, and drone delivery, became feasible.  

Even *without* so much automation Amazon is clobbering Big Box stores like Walmart.  *With* the automation, all those towns will almost certainly dry up, resulting in an even more severe transformation than Walmart itself produced.  Indeed, it looks like this:

http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/when-walmart-leaves-town

> Darnell Gardner, the president of the City Council, has estimated that the store accounted for forty per cent of Fairfield’s tax base. 

And that's just retail.  The same technologies -- the internet, AI, robotics -- that will enable Amazon to outcompete Walmart will also lead to the automation of manufacturing, which still accounts for a large percent of the American workforce (it's around 9%).  There are *many* medium-sized towns out there heavily dependent on one or a small number of large manufacturing plants -- like, say, an auto factory.

Each of these towns will get hit like Pittsburgh did in the early 80s -- different towns with different industries.  And if it happens quickly enough, it would raise the overall unemployment rate of the U.S. by several percent, for several years in a row.  

Even if it's just sporadic, with each town seeing a spike in unemployment for a few years at a time (different towns at different times), but with the *total* U.S. unemployment rate kept in check, it will still cause a lot of stress and upheaval.  People will constantly worry that their town will be next on the chopping block, and that they'll have to drive 30 miles away to get a new job.  Property value will shift rapidly, and unpredictably.  People will worry about their futures more, and whether they can afford to pay their mortgage in a few years.  

This will likely push people towards living in larger towns and cities with a diversity of industry; much like how diversifying a portfolio reduces risk, people will invest in their future by ""diversifying their place of residence"".     

But AI and robotics won't stop with automating warehouses and factories.  They will keep improving rapidly; one-by-one, industry after industry will get automated.  The contagion of economic uncertainty will spread from towns and cities dominated by only a few big players (e.g. Walmart) to ones a little more diverse (say with a Walmart Supercenter *and* an auto manufacturing plant *and* an inbound call center); eventually, a large percent of metropolitan areas will be affected.  

It's anyone's guess what that will be like.  I think it will be very dystopic, perhaps *beautiful* in some ways, like a scene from a cyberpunk novel.  "

"10 Advantages Of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)At [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/), we provide solutions that integrate [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), with business intelligence software and AI technology to improve various logistics scenarios and enable efficient and flexible operations. With a large portfolio of successful cases, we've listed some of the advantages of [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products).

**1. Tripling the productivity of order fulfillment**

When there are multiple orders received, the [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' system will carry out multi-order picking. It controls the picking robot to carry a corresponded rack with multiple SKUs to the workstation for order picking by workers. Hence, a single pick can fulfill multiple orders. Workers do not have to spend time walking, looking for ordered items, on a specific shelf in scattered locations of the warehouse. Therefore, workers can focus on order picking only. This helps to increase the picking productivity by 300% when compared to the manual operation.

**2. Lower Labor Costs**

[MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' AMR system also enables the optimization of labor. With this system, workers can spend all the working hours focusing on order picking only. When order picking becomes more efficient, it means fewer workers can achieve the same or much higher picking productivity than manual operation. This helps reducing labor costs. 

**3. No Single Point of Failure**

By implementing [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), warehouses can ensure continued operations and mitigate against issues associated with single-point-of-failure, which are common in operations relying on fixed infrastructure e.g operation may shut down when the conveyor belt is broken. If an AMR breaks down, it can be easily fixed and replaced without affecting the operation.

**4. Flexible to Scale Up and Down**

The number of robots as well as hours of work per day can be easily adjusted to meet changes in demand even if there is an unexpected peak or off-peak season. Businesses can now avoid the difficulties associated with finding labor under various peak scenarios and the time associated with hiring and then training new staff. Through real-time monitoring and inventory control, the scheduling of [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can dynamically adjusted following incoming demands. 

It also enables businesses to expand their scale in different stages. For example, deploying automation in one part of the warehouse and automating other parts later by adding more robots for the increasing demand in the future.

**5. Fast deployment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be flexibly implemented without the costs associated with fixed infrastructure. The mobility, autonomy, and size make them easy to implement into the existing warehouse. The infrastructures are required only as simple as five components: robots, workstation, WiFi, Shelf & QR code. Therefore, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be easily installed and can go-live within 1-3 months.

**6. Higher Storage Capacity**

The total number of storage bin locations will increase. As the storage bin locations are customized for specific SKUs, therefore, each bin location can be fully utilized to store the same items. This ensures there is no space being wasted.

**7. More Accurate Operations** 

Errors can have several explanations, however, avoiding them is becoming increasingly important as people have higher demands for faster and accurate services. By deploying [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), you can avoid errors associated with manual operations like stress brought on during peak, new staff, and increasingly difficult logistics scenarios like reverse logistics.

**8. Safer Operations** 

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are designed to work dynamically with their surroundings and are highly responsive. By using built-in sensors, laser scanner, and intelligent algorithms, it can detect workers or obstacles and then adjust the route. This allows for a safe and collaborative environment of AMRs and warehouse workers.

**9. Improve the working environment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)deployment is not simply replacing human works. Workers are still the most essential element in the operation. They are going to equip more skills to control the system and collaborate with the [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products). Therefore, deploying [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)is creating an ergonomic working process for workers and increasing their value to the business. 

**10. Flexible Relocation**

Imagine your warehouse needs to relocate due to costs or changes in business, in that case, moving the warehouse infrastructure can be a struggle and large additional cost may be involved in uninstalling. Unlike fixed infrastructure, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are easy to relocate and can enable a quick transition period.

"Robotic Process Automation: A Revolution in Process Automation 

In this age of tremendous technological innovations, automation seems  to attract experts to turn business more efficient and rapid. In  precise, [Robotic Process Automation](http://www.athenagt.com/roboticprocessautomation)  attracts organizations as an emerging technology which automates  tedious process of employees. This robust technology lets workforce to  concentrate on higher value work and speeds up the process. Adapting RPA  technologies in certain business processes, companies gain efficiencies  and reduce costs.

[Robotic Process Automation remarkably has the potential to transform industries. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/robotic-process-automation-a-revolution-in-process-automation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20remarkably%20has%20the%20potential%20to%20transform%20industries.&via=@AthenagtLtd&related=@AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/robotic-process-automation-a-revolution-in-process-automation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20remarkably%20has%20the%20potential%20to%20transform%20industries.&via=@AthenagtLtd&related=@AthenagtLtd) 

Imagine the performance of a business application modified with RPA,  it’s beyond your expectation. This is an intelligent automation process  which uses self-learning techniques by incorporating predictive and  cognitive computing. It reduces errors, minimizes human intervention in  process and also lessens irregularity in automated workflows. Although  enterprises stay abreast of new technologies, the trend continues with  integration of various work models.

**RPA, An impeccable technology in present digital-first age**

Concept of RPA can be explained as, software agents called “bots” are  programmed to perform iterative and monotonous, rules-based tasks that  are done by humans earlier. Such bots accomplish tasks such as handling  queries, transactions, manipulating data and log maintenance faster with  utmost accuracy. RPA is compatible with many applications like HTML,  .NET, and JAVA.

**What makes RPA stand out among different automation processes?** 

Besides the ability to perform repeatable tasks, it encompasses  cognitive intelligence. It uses AI, machine learning and speech  recognition, from that evolves self-learning bots having the ability to  analyse situations and correct faults. RPA tools like Blue Prism,  Automation Anywhere, UiPath and OpenSpan are used to automate certain  business processes. Programed bots using RPA tools has the ability to  manage and operate the data by interacting with various digital  integrations.

**RPA with Machine learning and Artificial intelligence**

RPA can automate certain process but its ability gets limited if it  involves decision making which requires application knowledge. ML comes  to use in this scenario, it helps construct a learning base dependent on  chronicle information and utilizes it for decision making and  forecasts.

Symbiosis of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capacities  advance business processes executed by RPA systems in better decision  making and efficient outputs. The data generated by RPA tools powers  AI’s analytical ability to attain profound understanding, which in turn  expands RPA adoption.

The combination of ML and RPA can make automation powerful. ML being  an emerging technology requires experts having deep knowledge abilities  to develop error-free ML models. RPA deployment being customer centric,  enterprises can adapt intelligent automation solutions that in turn  result in ROIs along with ML and AI.

**The utilization of RPA upgrades quality and limits the chance of errors**

As indicated by the RPA specialists, this innovation is sufficient to  change company’s perpetual work style and enables genuine satisfaction  to clients. There is zero chance of monotonous chores, business costs  are decreased and the workforce is occupied with more essential  undertakings and it upgrades the efficiency of the business. The outcome  of RPA is an extensive variety of new potential outcomes and upgraded  business esteem as far as process duration decrease, versatility,  development and continuous efficiency gains.

Athena is evolving as an RPA solution provider, it has automated  various processes for its clients. Its RPA team gives reasonable  responses to all the inquiries. It holds significant involvement in  working with diverse domains including healthcare, insurance, banking  and finance etc. Athena is the ultimate stop to gain more RPA knowledge  and our industry experts provide help in identification of use case and  deployment of RPA technology.

"How close or far are we from getting robots that can viably replace musical instrumentalists?This is a different question from robots replacing all musicians, which encompasses instrumentalists, arrangers, and composers.

Outside of some genres such as jazz that rely on heavy improvisation, many musicians are playing pieces that have already been written. Even jazz usually sticks with a chord progression, and its improvisation has [potential to be computer generated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VTI1BBLydE). No matter how skilled a player may be, it seems to me that robots will have much greater potential, with many more ""fingers"", much greater ""lung"" capacity, and no errors. As such, I think that it would be possible in the future to replace instrumentalists with them, and music jobs will be narrowed down to those who require much more creativity that can't be programmed too easily, such as creating new styles and genres. I imagine that there are already a good number of composers who can create great pieces but can't play any instrument at all, but this would become even more a thing in the future.

Technologies for [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xlm8LFImno) and [saxophone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjONQNUU8Fg) already seem to be getting there, whereas [violin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ_NF4J5W6s) is still in the beginning stages.

Live music may retain its instrumentalists because it seems to be a socio-cultural phenomenon that's more than just the music itself. It's also just cool to see novelty acts such as trying to beat the world record for guitar shredding speed. However, I magine that their industrial viability may be reduced.

How far are we from having robots that can replace human studio musicians to play, from simple backing tracks to complex classical or metal music? What is the view of the music industry on this?"
"When will commercial planes fly themselves?I have been contemplating this question for a while now, so I decided to do some research and come up with the best timeline that fits the past and likely future as possible.

I think everyone can agree, *one day* airlines and business jets will regularly fly themselves.  Whether it's 10 years or 1000 years...it will happen.  So the question is, when? I would love your feedback on my estimates!

First, It's nearly impossible to talk about pilot-less planes without talking about driver-less cars.  Eventually, aircraft will have to borrow some of the technology from driver-less cars (such as detecting runway edges, taxiway edges, finding it's way around an airport and park, etc...current aircraft cannot taxi themselves).

Conservative estimates on when we will see truly driver-less cars is around the year 2030, with mass adoption by year 2040.   By 2040, cars should be autonomous for a good 10 years plus, proving the technology. This I would consider the earliest possible truly autonomous airplane. But adoption of the technology this early, I think, is improbable.

http://lesswrong.com/lw/khs/question_driverless_car_forecasts/
http://www.driverless-future.com/?page_id=384

There are many reasons I doubt we will see autonomous commercial aircraft as early as 2040, as there are many technological, practical, and safety hurdles that would need to be addressed.

     Air traffic control systems need to go fully digital first. 

Fully digital en route services are planned to be operational around 2024, and ""D-taxi"" is planned to become operational around the year 2028. Lets add 5 years for good measure and say 2033, and that would be the starting of implementation.  It will have taken 20-some years before all the old ATC equipment has been replaced under the STARS system from 1996 to 2018, so lets add 20 years to the mass adoption of fully digital ATC nationwide. That puts us around 2050.  But that would only be for class B, large international airports.  Until smaller airports are capable of communicating with autonomous aircraft, they would be off limits and would detrimentally limit the benefit of autonomous private/charter aircraft.

http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/tamr/phased-approach/
https://www.aiaa.org/uploadedFiles/Events/Other/Corporate/2013_-_Aerospace_Todayand_Tomorrow/Bradford.pdf

I don't know what to think about smaller towered airports (class D)...as they still do not even require transponder (equipment to communicate information to radar) to be equipped in aircraft; and are not being required to equip with nextgen ADS-B transponder equipment in the future.  Who knows how long class D airports will remain voice/non-digital, but I presume for a very long time. (50 more years/2100?). This would essentially be the end of a simple fun flyer aircraft like a piper cub coming in to a towered airport for some practice landings.  I basically foresee un-controlled airports never allowing for autonomous aircraft to continue allowing hobby flyers.  

I suppose aircraft could be equipped with voice recognition technology to accept clearances eventually, and ground separation could be handled much as driver-less cars.  This means someone like google would have to be contracted by the FAA laser-map every towered airport in the US so the aircraft could navigate on the ground, and the motivation for doing so wouldn't be very strong unless an outside force pushed it.  I imagine taxiing aircraft at smaller airports will be the last thing autonomous airplanes do, and before that happens nearly all commercial aircraft will be semi-autonomous (air-only) first. (See below)

     Obviously, the aircraft needs to be capable of fully autonomous flight.

Well, this is no small hurdle.  First, I am making an assumption that fly-by-wire is a prerequisite. That may seem far fetched for smaller aircraft, but diamond is already testing it on their light twin aircraft, with an emergency auto-land feature in case of pilot incapacitation. This is what I foresee happening with smaller aircraft in the future, they are already single pilot but they will continue become more automated, with complete automation in event the pilot is incapacitated. We have already demonstrated a robot flying an aircraft based on visual cues alone as well.  Let's say around 20 years before this is common on new business aircraft, 2035- right around the time drive-less cars should become mainstream.

http://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-humanoid-robot-can-fly-a-plane-1638047317

Airliners will naturally follow the lead and start producing single-pilot aircraft, capable of semi-autonomous or emergency autonomous flight. Embraer says they are already planning on single-pilot aircraft and claim the technology will be ready around 2025.  Of course, the FAA lags behind so lets give it 10 years, also taking us to 2035 before we start to see the first single pilot airliners.  Another 15 years we would expect all new airliners to be single pilot...2045.

http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/embraer-reveals-vision-for-single-pilot-airliners-343348/

By the year 2040, when all new business aircraft have been presumably semi-autonomous (by this I mean autonomous, but supervised by a pilot) for ten years, I could see that many business owners would be requesting that the FAA issue some kind of semi-autonomous pilots license with reduced training and experience requirements, either to reduce pay/training costs for pilots or to allow owners to operate the aircraft themselves.  Lets give the sluggish FAA 10 years more to make that happen: SAP's (semi-autonomous pilots) are here by the year 2050.  Then SAP's will want planes that can taxi themselves too.  The technology to move on the surface will be borrowed from driveless cars. Someone like Garmin will probably start 3D mapping airports and add the capability and get FAA approval. Give that 10 more years, and we should have truly autonomous *capable* aircraft around 2060 at almost all controlled airports- under most conditions.

What conditions would an autonomous aircraft be bad at?  

The first thing that comes to mind is icing.  Anti-icing could be autonomous with ""hot wings"" (leading edges are hot to prevent ice build up), but the airframe itself can still accumulate excessive ice and needs to be monitored.  Airframe ice detection systems would need to be developed. (they do exist already).  However ground icing would be more critical.  Aircraft cannot have ice adhering to the flight surfaces before takeoff.  It would be impractical to have ice detection probes on every square inch of the aircraft.  Visual is the only way, and I think a human would have to do it, but it could be done remotely via hi-res wing and tail cameras.  Let's give it 10 years before that is all sorted out and approved....2070.
 
http://www.newavionics.com/9732_oem.html

Pre-flight inspections:  In short..some human has to do this for the foreseeable future, until computers exceed the mental capacity of humans...and that is another discussion altogether.  Even if a robot was capable of doing a preflight inspection, I'm going to want to check it out myself.  

Dual engine failures:  In the last 15 years, 3 airliners have had dual engine failures without some kind of cause from the pilots.  Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was the last one to perform the airline ""deadstick"" maneuver, successfully without fatalities in the Hudson river.  I can't think of how a computer would handle this...yes it could be programmed to aim for a river or lake or airport if one is nearby. But what if it has to crash...will it be able to avoid buildings and homes and people?  I could see very small aircraft like an Eclipse or Cirrus Jet automatically deploying a whole-aircraft parachute in such a situation.  But an automated airliner would need to avoid all people and buildings. The only thing I can think of is a remote operator taking the controls in such a situation.

http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/when-will-we-have-unmanned-commercial-airliners
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_flights_that_required_gliding

Medical emergencies: Especially on an airliner, someone has to be in charge of deciding when a diversion is necessary.  Remote pilot would be the only option.

     Public acceptance/conclusion:

This is maybe the most crucial, especially for airliners.  I think a generation would need to come and go before we go truly autonomous on airliners.  So I'll add 20-70 years to the 2060 date and say 2080 to 2130 the first truly autonomous airliner flies.

"How Are Linear Actuators Improving the Aerospace Industry?The aerospace industry uses high-performance mechanisms capable of working under non-standard conditions. Linear actuators designed for use in airless space best suit the requirements of aircraft equipment components. They provide smooth 2D or 3D movement of various elements of a spaceship or airliner: starting from pilot seats and ending with flight control systems.

## Industrial Linear Actuators: Revolutionary

Industrial actuators have drastically changed the processes of production mechanization, the technology for creating and operating automatic lines, and the automation of production processes. The scale of these changes is comparable to the move from the era of steam and coal to the era of electricity. With the evolving technologies and capabilities of linear actuators, they have made previously complex, time-consuming, and perhaps dangerous processes extremely easy. Operating them is easy; they can have a built-in or an external controller, controlling several electric drives or robots on a local network. Industrial automation starts with linear actuators, and their advanced technology has made things a lot more convenient, with the aerospace industry being no exception.

https://preview.redd.it/z7tr77w1vg551.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84b63f510d2030f369b5aa5586767795461d3fa1

 

## Aerospace Actuators

Most systems used in the aviation industry are controlled through drives. For instance, they are often used to control and limit engine speed by adjusting the craft’s levers and flaps.  Actuators convert electrical signals into mechanical motion or other physical variables (such as pressure or temperature); thus, they play an extremely active role in the control systems. For some areas, aviation included, it is important that the drives achieve extremely high dynamic loads while staying lightweight. The ability of actuators to be installed in small, limited spaces is of high significance to this industry. Furthermore, they must also be able to withstand harsh conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme heat, and cold. For instance, our [PA-13](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-13/) has a force capability of up to 3000 lbs, with an environmental rating of IP66. This is the type of actuator that would be suited towards the aerospace industry; however, purchasers need to be mindful of its operating noise rating of <90 dBA.

The production of components for the aerospace industry is focused on mechanical strength and reliability, high load capacity, compactness, and weight reduction. Components designed for aircraft interior solutions must be quiet, run smoothly, and be easy and convenient in use. For example, the inline actuator for controlling an aircraft engine is fully adapted to working in all ranges of torque and applied force. It provides full integration of the actuator with the flight control system of the aircraft.

&#x200B;

## Aerospace Actuators and Rocket Launches

Aerospace actuators provide rocket launch and flight control in multiple areas of manufacturing and design. With the recent launch of the NASA and SpaceX rocket, it’s quite interesting to see how [linear actuators](https://www.progressiveautomations.com/collections/linear-actuators) play a role in this. Below are some of the areas where they are implemented: 

* Changing the position of the rails and shanks of launch vehicles, tactical and strategic missiles.
* Controlling the angle of rocket engine nozzles.
* Moving platforms and compartments.
* Crew seat adjustment.
* Maintenance before flight starts. 

## How to Choose an Aircraft Actuator?

Linear actuator manufacturers offer all kinds of aerospace linear actuators to meet the variety of demands and requirements. When choosing actuators, customers in the aerospace and aircraft industry should consider the following: 

* **The stroke length**. Aerospace hydraulic actuators have a stroke length between a few inches and 20 feet. However, the stroke length of industrial electric linear actuators, unlike hydraulic and pneumatic ones, has neither minimum nor maximum limits.
* **Review supporting devices and accessories required.** For instance, a special mounting bracket is used for stationary installation when the linear drive is used only to act on a single element of the mechanism. A double hinge is necessary to ensure that the drive rotates when pulling in and out.
* **Should your actuator have feedback capabilities?** Feedback drive models are capable of synchronizing several flight control parts, and controlling and adjusting the position and speed of the aircraft.
* **Protection rating.** Your linear actuator manufacturer should offer models with high protection for wet and/or dusty environments.

https://preview.redd.it/2iejw8dcvg551.jpg?width=638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa4150e8176cd88edb333c7ded070ccd3d02fadf

 

## The Advantages of Electric Linear Actuators Compared to Hydraulic and Pneumatic

Ball-screw gears, hydraulic, and pneumatic linear actuators are being replaced with electric linear motors, an actuator with a linear servo that guarantees exceptional accuracy of movement at various speeds. In cases where you need to significantly reduce the duration of the working cycle, a linear electric motor is a prime choice, with its working acceleration (deceleration) reaching 3G. This is significantly more than what a conventional linear ball screw, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators can cope with.

## Conclusion

For most aspects of the aerospace industry, we recommend [super-powerful actuators](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-17/) that can work with a force of up to 10 pounds and/or a stroke of 0.24 – 60 inches. If you need to use micro or miniature models of industrial linear actuators with a power of only 5 pounds, we will find the right model for you. Progressive Automations has been continuously developing its electromechanical actuator for industries such as the aerospace industry. We are actively collaborating with leading aerospace companies, manufacturers of passenger seats for aviation, as well as supplying our products to manufacturers of special vehicles and equipment for airports.

Alongside their use in the aerospace industry, electric linear actuators can also be found in the following industries and areas: 

* service robots for education and the entertainment industry;
* drives for hospital beds;
* [adjustable office desks](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-category/table-lifts/);
* the building of [humanoid robots](https://progressiveactuators.com/blog/most-human-like-robots/);
* [agricultural production automation](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-industry/agricultural/)."
"Automation + population rise = an analog to the ""oncoming trains scenario."" Would mind-downloading be the ""switchman to switch the trains back to their separate tracks?""[This discussion entails an ominious scenario on the horizon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/5kxjww/the_robotic_grocery_store_of_the_future_is_here/dc23z6a/)

Automation may lead to fewer jobs for more people.

One train is automation, the other train is the rapidly-rising population. They're on the same track, traveling towards each other.

The crash would be countless people unable to find jobs, even when they're well-educated, because automation will have made too many jobs unnecessary and obsolete.

---

Now here's the ""switchman to prevent that collision:""

**Mind-downloading** would replace education - learn in just minutes what used to take years.

Everyone who undergoes a mind-download would learn to run their own business, practice and put forth a new groundbreaking idea, the Next Big Thing^(TM), and find any new way to make their own income no matter the level of automation by that time.

---

A UBI (Universal Basic Income) would be a basic safety net to help stave off some operating costs and other costs of propelling the next set of ideas and creativity forward, and perhaps not so much a way to live life (without contributing to society) off of it alone.

---

We will still have many other ways to contribute to society that automation can't:

Have you seen a robot invent something themselves? You know, 99% without our input? (1%: Powering them up, programming them to figure out what to invent and how to be self-reliant / self-sufficient.)

Have you seen automation author a new book? I don't just mean a technical manual; I mean something that would become a *bestseller*. Humans would need to want to read it; it would have to be as legendary as Harry Potter or better.

And even though I know [some robots can draw their own art now](https://www.google.com/search?q=drawn+by+artificial+intelligence&rlz=1C1NHXL_enUS699US699&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=974&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPmbL0tazRAhXKzVQKHfYJAwUQ_AUICSgC), will what they draw create a new subculture / fandom the likes of which would rival that of manga / anime? Manga / anime characters are pretty attractive; let's see A.I. draw something even more so.

The point I'm making is: We can still find something to contribute to the world (and beyond) that A.I. just can't ~~trump~~ supersede.

We will be better at finding that something, or making something new of that, once we increase our capacity for contributing to the world through mind-downloads.

---

Now, what are your notions on mind-downloading? Could sidestepping decades of education in minutes be the ticket to keeping neck-and-neck with A.I. and automation, thereby surviving well in this world?"

"Is OpenAI’s Study On The Labor Market Impacts Of AI Flawed?[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/1u0r8jsi1eta1.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13677e6277a704139053b5c9fa97e8031c59d3e2)

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found value in it!

Imagine the performance of a business application modified with RPA,  it’s beyond your expectation. This is an intelligent automation process  which uses self-learning techniques by incorporating predictive and  cognitive computing. It reduces errors, minimizes human intervention in  process and also lessens irregularity in automated workflows. Although  enterprises stay abreast of new technologies, the trend continues with  integration of various work models.

**RPA, An impeccable technology in present digital-first age**

Concept of RPA can be explained as, software agents called “bots” are  programmed to perform iterative and monotonous, rules-based tasks that  are done by humans earlier. Such bots accomplish tasks such as handling  queries, transactions, manipulating data and log maintenance faster with  utmost accuracy. RPA is compatible with many applications like HTML,  .NET, and JAVA.

Robots Will Do Everything You Do Now Only Better—What Then?
"Looking for a camera to continuously record collaborative robotNew to this sub, but have been searching around for common industry practice for a while. We have a collaborative robot that is performing a series of actions involving variable and fixed positioning. Sometimes the robot faults out in some weird configuration or position and we cannot figure out how it got there.

At my previous company we used some high speed cameras to watch a high speed production line. These were nice, but were an ordeal to setup and were super expensive. This process the robot is performing is very slow and so a high speed camera isn't necessary, but some ability to slow down the footage would be nice.

I am hoping to find a camera that we could easily move, setup, and record for extended periods of time 6-8 hours. It needs to have high detail so we can zoom in on footage.

"How Are Linear Actuators Improving the Aerospace Industry?The aerospace industry uses high-performance mechanisms capable of working under non-standard conditions. Linear actuators designed for use in airless space best suit the requirements of aircraft equipment components. They provide smooth 2D or 3D movement of various elements of a spaceship or airliner: starting from pilot seats and ending with flight control systems.

## Industrial Linear Actuators: Revolutionary

Industrial actuators have drastically changed the processes of production mechanization, the technology for creating and operating automatic lines, and the automation of production processes. The scale of these changes is comparable to the move from the era of steam and coal to the era of electricity. With the evolving technologies and capabilities of linear actuators, they have made previously complex, time-consuming, and perhaps dangerous processes extremely easy. Operating them is easy; they can have a built-in or an external controller, controlling several electric drives or robots on a local network. Industrial automation starts with linear actuators, and their advanced technology has made things a lot more convenient, with the aerospace industry being no exception.

https://preview.redd.it/z7tr77w1vg551.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84b63f510d2030f369b5aa5586767795461d3fa1

 

## Aerospace Actuators

Most systems used in the aviation industry are controlled through drives. For instance, they are often used to control and limit engine speed by adjusting the craft’s levers and flaps.  Actuators convert electrical signals into mechanical motion or other physical variables (such as pressure or temperature); thus, they play an extremely active role in the control systems. For some areas, aviation included, it is important that the drives achieve extremely high dynamic loads while staying lightweight. The ability of actuators to be installed in small, limited spaces is of high significance to this industry. Furthermore, they must also be able to withstand harsh conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme heat, and cold. For instance, our [PA-13](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-13/) has a force capability of up to 3000 lbs, with an environmental rating of IP66. This is the type of actuator that would be suited towards the aerospace industry; however, purchasers need to be mindful of its operating noise rating of <90 dBA.

The production of components for the aerospace industry is focused on mechanical strength and reliability, high load capacity, compactness, and weight reduction. Components designed for aircraft interior solutions must be quiet, run smoothly, and be easy and convenient in use. For example, the inline actuator for controlling an aircraft engine is fully adapted to working in all ranges of torque and applied force. It provides full integration of the actuator with the flight control system of the aircraft.

&#x200B;

## Aerospace Actuators and Rocket Launches

Aerospace actuators provide rocket launch and flight control in multiple areas of manufacturing and design. With the recent launch of the NASA and SpaceX rocket, it’s quite interesting to see how [linear actuators](https://www.progressiveautomations.com/collections/linear-actuators) play a role in this. Below are some of the areas where they are implemented: 

* Changing the position of the rails and shanks of launch vehicles, tactical and strategic missiles.
* Controlling the angle of rocket engine nozzles.
* Moving platforms and compartments.
* Crew seat adjustment.
* Maintenance before flight starts. 

## How to Choose an Aircraft Actuator?

Linear actuator manufacturers offer all kinds of aerospace linear actuators to meet the variety of demands and requirements. When choosing actuators, customers in the aerospace and aircraft industry should consider the following: 

* **The stroke length**. Aerospace hydraulic actuators have a stroke length between a few inches and 20 feet. However, the stroke length of industrial electric linear actuators, unlike hydraulic and pneumatic ones, has neither minimum nor maximum limits.
* **Review supporting devices and accessories required.** For instance, a special mounting bracket is used for stationary installation when the linear drive is used only to act on a single element of the mechanism. A double hinge is necessary to ensure that the drive rotates when pulling in and out.
* **Should your actuator have feedback capabilities?** Feedback drive models are capable of synchronizing several flight control parts, and controlling and adjusting the position and speed of the aircraft.
* **Protection rating.** Your linear actuator manufacturer should offer models with high protection for wet and/or dusty environments.

https://preview.redd.it/2iejw8dcvg551.jpg?width=638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa4150e8176cd88edb333c7ded070ccd3d02fadf

 

## The Advantages of Electric Linear Actuators Compared to Hydraulic and Pneumatic

Ball-screw gears, hydraulic, and pneumatic linear actuators are being replaced with electric linear motors, an actuator with a linear servo that guarantees exceptional accuracy of movement at various speeds. In cases where you need to significantly reduce the duration of the working cycle, a linear electric motor is a prime choice, with its working acceleration (deceleration) reaching 3G. This is significantly more than what a conventional linear ball screw, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators can cope with.

## Conclusion

For most aspects of the aerospace industry, we recommend [super-powerful actuators](https://progressiveactuators.com/products/linear-actuators-pa-17/) that can work with a force of up to 10 pounds and/or a stroke of 0.24 – 60 inches. If you need to use micro or miniature models of industrial linear actuators with a power of only 5 pounds, we will find the right model for you. Progressive Automations has been continuously developing its electromechanical actuator for industries such as the aerospace industry. We are actively collaborating with leading aerospace companies, manufacturers of passenger seats for aviation, as well as supplying our products to manufacturers of special vehicles and equipment for airports.

Alongside their use in the aerospace industry, electric linear actuators can also be found in the following industries and areas: 

* service robots for education and the entertainment industry;
* drives for hospital beds;
* [adjustable office desks](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-category/table-lifts/);
* the building of [humanoid robots](https://progressiveactuators.com/blog/most-human-like-robots/);
* [agricultural production automation](https://progressiveactuators.com/product-industry/agricultural/)."
"Question about Visual Automated InspectionI have a question....

Let's say I have a robot that performs a repetitive task... like a welding robot.

Let's say we have like a serial line of same parts, and on each part the robot spends 5 seconds in order to perform a welding.

Now I want to add a camera, or a optical sensor of some kind, that will automatically inspect each part's welding quality...

So my question is, how good is the current technology? How accurate it is, how detailed is the inspection, how long does it takes to inspect a part....

My question is only about the visual automated inspection....

Thanks."
"When will commercial planes fly themselves?I have been contemplating this question for a while now, so I decided to do some research and come up with the best timeline that fits the past and likely future as possible.

I think everyone can agree, *one day* airlines and business jets will regularly fly themselves.  Whether it's 10 years or 1000 years...it will happen.  So the question is, when? I would love your feedback on my estimates!

First, It's nearly impossible to talk about pilot-less planes without talking about driver-less cars.  Eventually, aircraft will have to borrow some of the technology from driver-less cars (such as detecting runway edges, taxiway edges, finding it's way around an airport and park, etc...current aircraft cannot taxi themselves).

Conservative estimates on when we will see truly driver-less cars is around the year 2030, with mass adoption by year 2040.   By 2040, cars should be autonomous for a good 10 years plus, proving the technology. This I would consider the earliest possible truly autonomous airplane. But adoption of the technology this early, I think, is improbable.

http://lesswrong.com/lw/khs/question_driverless_car_forecasts/
http://www.driverless-future.com/?page_id=384

There are many reasons I doubt we will see autonomous commercial aircraft as early as 2040, as there are many technological, practical, and safety hurdles that would need to be addressed.

     Air traffic control systems need to go fully digital first. 

Fully digital en route services are planned to be operational around 2024, and ""D-taxi"" is planned to become operational around the year 2028. Lets add 5 years for good measure and say 2033, and that would be the starting of implementation.  It will have taken 20-some years before all the old ATC equipment has been replaced under the STARS system from 1996 to 2018, so lets add 20 years to the mass adoption of fully digital ATC nationwide. That puts us around 2050.  But that would only be for class B, large international airports.  Until smaller airports are capable of communicating with autonomous aircraft, they would be off limits and would detrimentally limit the benefit of autonomous private/charter aircraft.

http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/tamr/phased-approach/
https://www.aiaa.org/uploadedFiles/Events/Other/Corporate/2013_-_Aerospace_Todayand_Tomorrow/Bradford.pdf

I don't know what to think about smaller towered airports (class D)...as they still do not even require transponder (equipment to communicate information to radar) to be equipped in aircraft; and are not being required to equip with nextgen ADS-B transponder equipment in the future.  Who knows how long class D airports will remain voice/non-digital, but I presume for a very long time. (50 more years/2100?). This would essentially be the end of a simple fun flyer aircraft like a piper cub coming in to a towered airport for some practice landings.  I basically foresee un-controlled airports never allowing for autonomous aircraft to continue allowing hobby flyers.  

I suppose aircraft could be equipped with voice recognition technology to accept clearances eventually, and ground separation could be handled much as driver-less cars.  This means someone like google would have to be contracted by the FAA laser-map every towered airport in the US so the aircraft could navigate on the ground, and the motivation for doing so wouldn't be very strong unless an outside force pushed it.  I imagine taxiing aircraft at smaller airports will be the last thing autonomous airplanes do, and before that happens nearly all commercial aircraft will be semi-autonomous (air-only) first. (See below)

     Obviously, the aircraft needs to be capable of fully autonomous flight.

Well, this is no small hurdle.  First, I am making an assumption that fly-by-wire is a prerequisite. That may seem far fetched for smaller aircraft, but diamond is already testing it on their light twin aircraft, with an emergency auto-land feature in case of pilot incapacitation. This is what I foresee happening with smaller aircraft in the future, they are already single pilot but they will continue become more automated, with complete automation in event the pilot is incapacitated. We have already demonstrated a robot flying an aircraft based on visual cues alone as well.  Let's say around 20 years before this is common on new business aircraft, 2035- right around the time drive-less cars should become mainstream.

http://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-humanoid-robot-can-fly-a-plane-1638047317

Airliners will naturally follow the lead and start producing single-pilot aircraft, capable of semi-autonomous or emergency autonomous flight. Embraer says they are already planning on single-pilot aircraft and claim the technology will be ready around 2025.  Of course, the FAA lags behind so lets give it 10 years, also taking us to 2035 before we start to see the first single pilot airliners.  Another 15 years we would expect all new airliners to be single pilot...2045.

http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/embraer-reveals-vision-for-single-pilot-airliners-343348/

By the year 2040, when all new business aircraft have been presumably semi-autonomous (by this I mean autonomous, but supervised by a pilot) for ten years, I could see that many business owners would be requesting that the FAA issue some kind of semi-autonomous pilots license with reduced training and experience requirements, either to reduce pay/training costs for pilots or to allow owners to operate the aircraft themselves.  Lets give the sluggish FAA 10 years more to make that happen: SAP's (semi-autonomous pilots) are here by the year 2050.  Then SAP's will want planes that can taxi themselves too.  The technology to move on the surface will be borrowed from driveless cars. Someone like Garmin will probably start 3D mapping airports and add the capability and get FAA approval. Give that 10 more years, and we should have truly autonomous *capable* aircraft around 2060 at almost all controlled airports- under most conditions.

What conditions would an autonomous aircraft be bad at?  

The first thing that comes to mind is icing.  Anti-icing could be autonomous with ""hot wings"" (leading edges are hot to prevent ice build up), but the airframe itself can still accumulate excessive ice and needs to be monitored.  Airframe ice detection systems would need to be developed. (they do exist already).  However ground icing would be more critical.  Aircraft cannot have ice adhering to the flight surfaces before takeoff.  It would be impractical to have ice detection probes on every square inch of the aircraft.  Visual is the only way, and I think a human would have to do it, but it could be done remotely via hi-res wing and tail cameras.  Let's give it 10 years before that is all sorted out and approved....2070.
 
http://www.newavionics.com/9732_oem.html

Pre-flight inspections:  In short..some human has to do this for the foreseeable future, until computers exceed the mental capacity of humans...and that is another discussion altogether.  Even if a robot was capable of doing a preflight inspection, I'm going to want to check it out myself.  

Dual engine failures:  In the last 15 years, 3 airliners have had dual engine failures without some kind of cause from the pilots.  Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was the last one to perform the airline ""deadstick"" maneuver, successfully without fatalities in the Hudson river.  I can't think of how a computer would handle this...yes it could be programmed to aim for a river or lake or airport if one is nearby. But what if it has to crash...will it be able to avoid buildings and homes and people?  I could see very small aircraft like an Eclipse or Cirrus Jet automatically deploying a whole-aircraft parachute in such a situation.  But an automated airliner would need to avoid all people and buildings. The only thing I can think of is a remote operator taking the controls in such a situation.

http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/when-will-we-have-unmanned-commercial-airliners
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_flights_that_required_gliding

Medical emergencies: Especially on an airliner, someone has to be in charge of deciding when a diversion is necessary.  Remote pilot would be the only option.

     Public acceptance/conclusion:

This is maybe the most crucial, especially for airliners.  I think a generation would need to come and go before we go truly autonomous on airliners.  So I'll add 20-70 years to the 2060 date and say 2080 to 2130 the first truly autonomous airliner flies.

"What are the chances of my job being automated?Hi all, I’m a young professional who works in the field of cell genetics. I currently work as a cytogenetic technologist, and perform complex assays and karyotype patient chromosomes, then give a diagnosis based on abnormality of those chromosomes, such as if cancer is present, what stage, etc, also look for common genetic disorders such trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) Klinefelter, deletions or additions to chromosomes, etc etc. identifying the chromosomes is quite a difficult process and some cases take all day to solve, as they look different depending on the culture, patient, and other factors such how spread the chromosomes are within the metaphase. I was getting paranoid as I went to “will my job be taken by robots” the website, and read medical technologists have a 90% chance of being automated in the near future. I like to believe my job is too complicated for that, as it seems hard for A.I. to identify chromosomes that sometimes overlap each other and look totally different frequently, but alas I am concerned and looking for opinions. Thanks so much everyone!

"Harnessing SimplicitySo I got punted over here by /u/Quipster99

I'm a software developer who first got exposed to automation when I got a co-op to automate collecting sound recordings from an ultrasound set up over a fake carotid artery. If that sounds impressive I want to stress how unimpressive I am. I'm not an amazing programmer. I'm average. Yet I had the ability to harness knowledge far greater then my own. In the end my efforts produced something that had below millimeter precision that shot a frequency through molded plastic and captured every aspect of the resonance. Doing insane math to give me what the fluid looked like at the moment, able to track individual molecules as they tumbled through the phantom.

To this day I want to build my own robot just because it was the coolest fucking thing I ever did. I'm on my way too. It's tough to raise funds but I'm slowly putting together my own Mendela Prusa 3D printer. I want to do it this way so I can have full control.

I really like this stuff is what I'm saying. I know a lot of you are probably interested in the robotics side of automation but I wanted to present to you guys some of my ideas and work on harnessing simplicity.

The robot I made was really complicated. It was automated but it had a fairly large flaw. It wasn't adaptable to things. If you presented it with something it didn't know how to deal with it simply crashed. It would gladly do what you told it. Which means you always get the results you want but you never get anything you weren't expecting either.

[Take Conway's game of life for example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). That is an example of harnessing simplicity for a purpose. It is one of the most basic examples I can think of. Binary itself is another one. By turning a transistor from the real world into a binary value we can repeat the process to get computation. That simple property of on and off used to produce results in orders of magnitude.

Terrain generation in games is something I can think of that shows how simple rules can expand out to create things that aren't designed but are complex. The complexity arising through the minor mechanics of the simplicity. [I took the idea of the game of life for instance and made something that generates little islands for a resource trading game I'm working on](http://i.imgur.com/cy15v7D.jpg). Randomly seeded data uses simple rules to boil down into a smattering of islands. To draw any of the results myself would take forever and yet I can produce almost and infinite number of them by tweaking the seed minorly.

That game itself is me trying to harness simplicity. I have pirates in it that have very simple rules. If they aren't looking at you they turn towards you, if they are not close to you they move forward. If the rate they are turning means they can't turn quick enough to get you they slow down. Finally when they are lined up with you and close enough they fire.

Its just very simple mathematics but in the end they give the perception of some sort of AI because they are using at least simple reasoning. Its not sophisticated but its oddly intelligent. They factor in your velocity as well so they seem to be having more going on upstairs then move around. None of this involves anything beyond giving a dot simple rules on how to get to another dot. And then [Pirates!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBx_85vByXc)

I'm finally having success with some of these concepts. However going forward with this stuff the same principals of automation I am applying to the pirates figuring things out I can apply to say 3D space. Where I could design 3D shapes based on simple rules.

This is where the recent advances in technology get me really really excited. By utilizing simplicity I can vastly improve my automation. I could in theory build a game that used an algorithm to try and solve how to build a bridge between two things. If this was done reasonably well the same way I can produce complex islands I could produce bridges that would support things.

Now what if the game physics and world was a decent representation of something in the real world? I could actually feed that data out to my printer and construct the bridge. I'm not an engineer but it would be insanely strong or it would not be solved one or the other. The power of simplicity giving me access to knowledge and building techniques I could never ever have thought up.

I really feel that our next leap forward in computing will not be in more power but using that power more intelligently. We have massive amounts of processing power that we burn on pretty trivial shit. If we re-imagine logic to not be something that is rigid but that massive logic systems can become organic if built correctly. Lets say I design a computer program that can perform key strokes, I also hook it up to a genetic algorithm. By figuring out the right variables I could set up a scenario where the computers one mission would be to find the correct combination of key strokes and mouse movements to hack into another computer. It would need to find its way onto the other computer, install itself and make a connection.

This would take a long fucking time but theoretically its possible for it to solve that problem. A clever enough algorithm could work. Taking small steps to figure out how to move around the computer its on first. Eventually if it made its way onto the other computer then it has a working model. By getting the two talking they can co-ordinate theoretically to get onto another computer. Eventually you could get the growing hoard to find its way onto more and more machines by endlessly trying every combination they can. Once it finds how to do it to a machine it records it and then can instantly jump onto whatever hurdle it solved.

I don't know how that won't happen some day. The rules of infinite complexity from simplicity means its totally possible. This is the power I'm so fascinated by. Its the power of life itself. For so long we tried to figure out what life is. We might not ever crack the secrets of DNA but what if we don't need to? What if we stole their tools of simplicity and did whatever we wanted with them. Being able to apply the principals of DNA to more and more things removed from biology is totally fascinating to me.

Anyways that's why I love the idea of harnessing simplicity. I can be pretty average and by utilizing repetition I can create things far more complicated then my mind alone would produce.

If you guys find this stuff interesting let me know, I fucking love it."
"Know how Financial service providers can transform their core operations using RPA Innovation 

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) on **November 30, 2018** under [**RPA**](http://blog.athenagt.com/category/rpa/)

&#x200B;

To  compete in an undeniably saturated financial industry,  where the  virtual operation adoption is increasing, financial companies need to  stay focused on their end goal. Expectations at customer end could be  hassle-free operations, accessibility, faster responsive, a value from  financial products/services, altogether a delighted client experience.  Expectations at firms end could be improved efficiency, a better  understanding of clientele, maintenance of privacy and security and low  costs.

[Robotic  Process Automation is the ultimate solution to exceed the expectations  at both customer and financial institutions' end. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd) 

Major banks such as Axis Bank and Deutsche Bank have implemented RPA  to automate certain business processes. RPA rapidly reduces costs, time  and staff required for various processes, in which tedious and  rule-based tasks are carried out by programmed “bots“, with reduced  human intervention. Hence, efficiency, accuracy and business operations  of the industry observe a substantial shift.

Financial service providers manage huge customer data and there is a  possibility of human error. By adopting RPA, they can lessen manual  processing and time consumption, maintain accuracy. Software bots have  the ability to perform rule-based logical tasks with human intelligence.  They can bring down the processing time up to 40% and costs up to 80%,  automating certain processes can help staff in engaging with higher  value tasks to shift the operational efficiency.

Let’s look into a few areas of financial institutes, where RPA can be implemented.

# Customer Service

Every financial services company  deals with numerous queries regarding products/services. RPA can be  implemented here, reducing the turnaround time and creating an improved  customer responsive system. Chatbots resolve the queries in real time,  using AI for decision making and NLP to process natural language. With  the help of NLP, Chabot can understand the natural language to  communicate with customer at ease, replacing staff.

# Compliance

Financial institutions, contributing to the economy, has to abide by  compliance. RPA has the ability to fetch and compose data from multiple  channels can improve the efficiency of the companies compliance program,  saving it from risks. It can also be available 24/7 and can streamline  processes like data collection, compilation sorting information and risk  reporting.

# Accounts Payable

Accounts payable is a simple yet repetitive process in banking. The  process involves producing customer information, validation, and process  payment. As this is a rule-based process, RPA can be implemented  undoubtedly in this case. RPA along with the help of optical character  recognition (OCR) facilitates the automation of the above process. OCR  reads the customer information from a scanned copy of the physical form  and feeds it to the RPA system. The system validates the data and  processes the payment. If an error occurs, It can notify the agent on  necessary actions.

# Credit cards and Loan Processing

The conventional credit card and loan application processing is a  time and labor intensive task. This task is tedious to the staff and  also displeasing to the customers, with RPA adoption, banks can swift  this process. RPA system can integrate and communicate with multiple  systems coherently, to fetch and validate the data and uses AI’s  decision making to either approve or reject the application.

# Fraud Detection

Along with the pros, the digital revolution has also brought some  cons and the notable one is FRAUD. Since financial institutions deal  with volume data, it’s hard for them to monitor all the customer  interactions to identify malicious activity. RPA comes to bank’s aid in  such scenarios, RPA deployed system has the ability to identify the  probable fraud transactions, recognizing the logical patterns in  real-time. It also can prevent fraud by notifying the executive/customer  on an unusual transaction.

# KYC Process

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a mandatory process for most of the  financial services companies. If manually done, it requires hundreds of  employees to validate the customer information. According to Thomson  Reuters, banks spend more than $384 million per year on KYC process  compliance. In order to minimize FTEs, reduce costs and to save an  adequate amount of time, the financial service providers are adopting  RPA to their business operations. RPA implementation in such process  minimizes human errors with 100% accuracy.

# General Ledger

To create accurate financial statements, the general ledger must be  updated with information such as revenue, assets, liabilities,  expenses.etc., this information needs to be gathered from different  legacy systems, that needs to be validated before publishing to a  general ledger.

Management of this huge data is prone to errors and inaccuracy.

RPA resolves this complexity, being powerful and technology  independent, it can be integrated with any system to collect data of  multiple formats. This also saves a lot of data handling time and  maintains accuracy.

# Report Automation

Creating an error-free and accurate report consumer a huge amount of  and time and number of employees. But still, doesn’t completely  eradicate the human error. RPA systems can collect data in multiple  formats, create reports by auto-filling the extracted data in the  required format and produce reports without errors at minimal cost and  time.

📝 Editorial 

The recent emergence of pre-trained language models and transformer architectures pushed the creation of larger and larger machine learning models. Google’s BERT presented attention mechanism and transformer architecture possibilities as the “next big thing” in ML, and the numbers seem surreal. OpenAI’s GPT-2 set a record by processing 1.5 billion parameters, followed by Microsoft’s Turing-NLG, which processed 17 billion parameters just to see the new GPT-3 processing an astonishing 175 billion parameters. To not feel complacent, just this week Microsoft announced a new release of its DeepSpeed framework (which powers Turing-NLG), which can train a model with **up to a trillion parameters**. That sounds insane but it really isn’t.  

What we are seeing is a consequence of several factors. First, computation power and parallelization techniques have evolved to a point where it is relatively easy to train machine learning models in large clusters of machines. Second and most importantly, in the current state of machine learning, larger models have regularly outperformed smaller and more specialized models. Knowledge reusability methods like transfer learning are still in very nascent stages. As a result, it’s really hard to build small models that can operate in uncertain environments. Furthermore, as models like GPT-3 and Turing-NLG have shown, there is some unexplainable magic that happens after models go past a certain size.

Many of the immediate machine learning problems might be solved by scaling the current generation of neural network architectures. Plain and simple, when it comes to machine learning, size matters.  

We would love to hear your opinions about the debate between broader-larger vs. smaller and more specialized models.

"Multi-language Robotic AdapterHello! I am relatively new to the robotics scene and deal mainly with 6 axis robot arms for manufacturing and production. I work with both ABB, KUKA and a little bit of UR for different processes and was wondering if it was possible to actually come up with an adapter (or something like 'Google Translate) which helps make the different languages universal. 

In my mind it's something like a TV box that pairs with either ABB's robotstudio or KUKA' sunrise programs but automatically translates whatever I program in the TV box into their respective systems. 

Is it even possible? What are the challenges I would be facing and are there similar technologies already developed? 

Thank you so much! "
"Is OpenAI’s Study On The Labor Market Impacts Of AI Flawed?[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/1u0r8jsi1eta1.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13677e6277a704139053b5c9fa97e8031c59d3e2)

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

"Work is important. Without meaningful work, human beings crumble. What types of jobs will employ the billions of people on Earth after the so-called robot revolution occurs?Humans need work.  Humans have evolved to work and many studies have showed how important work is to the human psyche.

Some say that after the robot revolution, humans will make their own work.  They will create art at home, or spend more time with their families.  I sincerely doubt this.  I think instead people will just spend more time in front of the television, or in other than less worthwhile pursuits, resulting in unhappy and unfulfilled populations.  In the long run, this scenario would lead to civil unrest and maybe even revolution.

So since work is so important, what post-robotic revolution jobs will employ the billions of human beings on Earth?

This is a thought question that we, as a society, are going to have to figure out before the robotic revolution occurs.  If not, we do so at our own peril."
"How robotics process automation helps in different industriesRPA **developed by 63% in 2017** and keeps on being one of the quickly developing advancements in numerous enterprises! RPA lets organizations computerize current tasks as though a genuine individual was doing them across frameworks and applications. It cooperates with every system similarly as a human client would associate.

[**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**](https://www.zenesys.com/robotics-process-automation) is changing the path associations across various ventures to work and organize businesses together. It permits associations to computerize specific kinds of work procedures to lessen the time spent on expensive manual tasks and increase endeavors to convey critical work.

 RPA doesn't include a physical or mechanical robot. Rather, **it is a software running on a virtual** or physical machine."
"Robotic Process Automation: A Revolution in Process Automation 

In this age of tremendous technological innovations, automation seems  to attract experts to turn business more efficient and rapid. In  precise, [Robotic Process Automation](http://www.athenagt.com/roboticprocessautomation)  attracts organizations as an emerging technology which automates  tedious process of employees. This robust technology lets workforce to  concentrate on higher value work and speeds up the process. Adapting RPA  technologies in certain business processes, companies gain efficiencies  and reduce costs.

[Robotic Process Automation remarkably has the potential to transform industries. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/robotic-process-automation-a-revolution-in-process-automation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20remarkably%20has%20the%20potential%20to%20transform%20industries.&via=@AthenagtLtd&related=@AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/robotic-process-automation-a-revolution-in-process-automation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20remarkably%20has%20the%20potential%20to%20transform%20industries.&via=@AthenagtLtd&related=@AthenagtLtd) 

Imagine the performance of a business application modified with RPA,  it’s beyond your expectation. This is an intelligent automation process  which uses self-learning techniques by incorporating predictive and  cognitive computing. It reduces errors, minimizes human intervention in  process and also lessens irregularity in automated workflows. Although  enterprises stay abreast of new technologies, the trend continues with  integration of various work models.

**RPA, An impeccable technology in present digital-first age**

Concept of RPA can be explained as, software agents called “bots” are  programmed to perform iterative and monotonous, rules-based tasks that  are done by humans earlier. Such bots accomplish tasks such as handling  queries, transactions, manipulating data and log maintenance faster with  utmost accuracy. RPA is compatible with many applications like HTML,  .NET, and JAVA.

**What makes RPA stand out among different automation processes?** 

Besides the ability to perform repeatable tasks, it encompasses  cognitive intelligence. It uses AI, machine learning and speech  recognition, from that evolves self-learning bots having the ability to  analyse situations and correct faults. RPA tools like Blue Prism,  Automation Anywhere, UiPath and OpenSpan are used to automate certain  business processes. Programed bots using RPA tools has the ability to  manage and operate the data by interacting with various digital  integrations.

**RPA with Machine learning and Artificial intelligence**

RPA can automate certain process but its ability gets limited if it  involves decision making which requires application knowledge. ML comes  to use in this scenario, it helps construct a learning base dependent on  chronicle information and utilizes it for decision making and  forecasts.

Symbiosis of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capacities  advance business processes executed by RPA systems in better decision  making and efficient outputs. The data generated by RPA tools powers  AI’s analytical ability to attain profound understanding, which in turn  expands RPA adoption.

The combination of ML and RPA can make automation powerful. ML being  an emerging technology requires experts having deep knowledge abilities  to develop error-free ML models. RPA deployment being customer centric,  enterprises can adapt intelligent automation solutions that in turn  result in ROIs along with ML and AI.

**The utilization of RPA upgrades quality and limits the chance of errors**

As indicated by the RPA specialists, this innovation is sufficient to  change company’s perpetual work style and enables genuine satisfaction  to clients. There is zero chance of monotonous chores, business costs  are decreased and the workforce is occupied with more essential  undertakings and it upgrades the efficiency of the business. The outcome  of RPA is an extensive variety of new potential outcomes and upgraded  business esteem as far as process duration decrease, versatility,  development and continuous efficiency gains.

Athena is evolving as an RPA solution provider, it has automated  various processes for its clients. Its RPA team gives reasonable  responses to all the inquiries. It holds significant involvement in  working with diverse domains including healthcare, insurance, banking  and finance etc. Athena is the ultimate stop to gain more RPA knowledge  and our industry experts provide help in identification of use case and  deployment of RPA technology.

"The world is utterly unprepared for artificial intelligence in the near-term: ""Media Synthesis"", the phenomenon which includes deepfakes, is further along than almost anyone realizes and is prepared for, and this will result in a lot of fun and angst come the 2020sI run the /r/MediaSynthesis subreddit, collecting links and discussions surrounding this technology. The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years— and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty— is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner— meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite— everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg)— the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

We don't need AGI for any of this either, so don't think that we have to wait until we ""solve intelligence"" to see any of this. Nor should you expect it to cost a fortune to use. We only need GANs and most of this tech is open source.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

As /u/ksblur said: 

> Strange how we live in a world of trust-based security. It would be relatively easy for cryptography to solve that issue (your phone could automatically reject calls without proper signatures or encryption), but  people grew up ""trusting"" the systems so there's not a lot of incentive to change it.

"Billboard threatens workers with automation to keep wages down. Here's why that's wrong.A billboard in San Francisco is [threatening workers with automation](http://pando.com/2014/07/17/new-san-francisco-billboard-warns-workers-theyll-be-replaced-by-ipads-if-they-demand-a-fair-wage/) unless they abandon a minimum wage increase. As a fan of automation, I am deeply concerned that businesses are using it as a bogeyman to scare workers into submission. No good will come of this, not for workers, and not for automation.

The argument used is a false one. No matter how low a wage you accept, it will not protect your job from automation. The current federal minimum wage for tipped workers such as waiters is only [$2.13 an hour](http://www.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm), yet both Applebee's and Chili's are putting tablets on [every table nationwide](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/03/tablets_at_restaurants_applebee_s_chili_s_race_to_eliminate_human_interaction.html). If $2.13 an hour isn't a low enough wage to protect your job, what is?

Perhaps we should accept Chinese labor conditions to protect our jobs. Except, as Foxconn's CEO bluntly put it, ""as human beings are also animals, to manage [one million animals](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/asia/foxconn-chairman-compares-his-workforce-to-animals/776) gives me a headache."" Foxconn announced a plan to [replace its workers with robots](http://www.cnet.com/news/foxconn-to-replace-workers-with-robots/), a plan they're [now implementing](http://www.geek.com/apple/foxconn-is-deploying-10000-foxbots-to-assemble-iphones-ipads-1598600/). If Chinese workers' low wages aren't protecting them from automation, how low do wages have to go to keep humans employed?

The reality is, as long as your wage is more than the price of electricity, your operational costs are always going to be more than a tablet's. The only things protecting your job from automation are the state of technology, company policy and customer acceptance.

This may make automation look like a job-killing villain. But if we respond to the automation of the workforce with a [basic income](/r/basicincome), we can have a humane approach, not a threatening, ""bow down before your new robot overlords"" approach. We could even live in a new Athens, where robots are our slaves, rather than the robots enslaving us, giving us the freedom and resources to [create cultural works](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/03/years-free-wages-led-harper-lee-writing-kill-mockingbird/), [start businesses](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KFC+Celebrates+50+Years%3B+Investment+of+$105+Social+Security+Check...-a090022955), and live our lives on our own terms, not with the threat of hardship.

But as long as we allow the discussion to be hijacked by narrow interests trying to exploit automation as a rod with which to lash workers, the politics of automation are going to be harsh and destructive, and not productive for humanity."
"Anybody working on farming automations? (Or know of one?) /r/farmtechAfter some discussion with others about the increase in automation technologies for farming. I found it hard to find a central place to learn more about opensource farming automations and how it might go when combined with other cutting edge farming technologies like ""vertical farming"".

So /r/farmtech is created to help spur discussion, and hopefully action/research into the future of democratising access to food through open access technologies. 

If you know of any technologies, or opensource projects that we should know of, please subscribe to our subreddit and post a thread on it. I will cross promote this with other subreddits (like /r/farming/ which is full of farmers) in the hope that we can get many people of different skills to work together on this very important field.

If you are actively working on such a project, posting text updates is definitely encouraged. (We are looking more specifically at automation/robotic technology or vertical farming)

Farming automation is really just the next step after the first industrial revolution. It means food security for everyone (As long as it is not centrally controlled)."
"Smart Tools and Economic Collapse Humans are the original ""smart tools"". We are able to copy ourselves and pass on our knowledge.  We built other tools using food-powered energy and raw materials from nature. Technologies like automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence are going into new types of smart tools - tools that don't need us any more to do their job. The new smart tools will also be able to copy themselves, pass on their knowledge, and make other tools using energy and raw materials from nature. The problem is our economic system is based on trading our labor for money, then trading that money for the other things we need and want.

 If the owners of the smart tools don't need people to run a business, they will get rid of them as an unnecessary expense. But the people who are unemployed will not be buying the products and services those businesses are selling, so those businesses lose income. They can't afford rent or mortgage payments, so landlords and lenders also lose income. Governments then also lose tax sources based on income, employment, sales, and property. If replacement of people by smart tools becomes widespread, everyone loses.  It leads to recession, depression, or economic collapse of our current system.

 Our tools are only going to get smarter and cheaper with time, but people have a limited ability to improve their skills or learn new ones. So eventually all conventional jobs are at risk from this problem. The question is when, and how do we deal with it?

----

  One answer is to leverage personal production networks and smart tools to solve the very problem they create.

 A personal production network is a distributed group of people.  They create useful products and services for themselves and people outside the network by building and operating their own equipment. They bootstrap from a starter set of skills, knowledge, tools, and resources. They help each other expand and upgrade from where they started. This includes adding new and improved skills; and more information, designs, and plans for their knowledge base. They buy more tools, equipment, and workspaces out of their earnings, or make their own using what they already have. Lastly, they accumulate funding, materials, energy, parts, and other resources to work with. Member goals include meeting most or all of their personal needs, be self-supporting, economically secure, and able to help new people by growing the existing network or starting new ones.

 A fully developed network would be able to make everything members want, including copying all their equipment and supplying new starter sets. A self-contained production chain, from raw materials to finished products, makes self-expansion and upgrade easier and less expensive. ""Smart tools"", which exploit automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence, can grow efficiently with little labor. A new network won't start out with all these abilities, but would grow into them a step at a time.  As owners of the smart tools, they are not at risk from labor displacement.  They still benefit from the tools, no matter how smart they get.

The ""Seed Factories"" subreddit has a link to a paper on ""Smart Tools and Self-Expanding Systems"" which goes into more depth on this subject.  It's a fairly long paper, so there is also a shorter slide presentation on ""Maker Networks"" (MakerNets)"" that covers the main points.

"Know how Financial service providers can transform their core operations using RPA Innovation 

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) on **November 30, 2018** under [**RPA**](http://blog.athenagt.com/category/rpa/)

&#x200B;

To  compete in an undeniably saturated financial industry,  where the  virtual operation adoption is increasing, financial companies need to  stay focused on their end goal. Expectations at customer end could be  hassle-free operations, accessibility, faster responsive, a value from  financial products/services, altogether a delighted client experience.  Expectations at firms end could be improved efficiency, a better  understanding of clientele, maintenance of privacy and security and low  costs.

[Robotic  Process Automation is the ultimate solution to exceed the expectations  at both customer and financial institutions' end. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd) 

Major banks such as Axis Bank and Deutsche Bank have implemented RPA  to automate certain business processes. RPA rapidly reduces costs, time  and staff required for various processes, in which tedious and  rule-based tasks are carried out by programmed “bots“, with reduced  human intervention. Hence, efficiency, accuracy and business operations  of the industry observe a substantial shift.

Financial service providers manage huge customer data and there is a  possibility of human error. By adopting RPA, they can lessen manual  processing and time consumption, maintain accuracy. Software bots have  the ability to perform rule-based logical tasks with human intelligence.  They can bring down the processing time up to 40% and costs up to 80%,  automating certain processes can help staff in engaging with higher  value tasks to shift the operational efficiency.

Let’s look into a few areas of financial institutes, where RPA can be implemented.

# Customer Service

Every financial services company  deals with numerous queries regarding products/services. RPA can be  implemented here, reducing the turnaround time and creating an improved  customer responsive system. Chatbots resolve the queries in real time,  using AI for decision making and NLP to process natural language. With  the help of NLP, Chabot can understand the natural language to  communicate with customer at ease, replacing staff.

# Compliance

Financial institutions, contributing to the economy, has to abide by  compliance. RPA has the ability to fetch and compose data from multiple  channels can improve the efficiency of the companies compliance program,  saving it from risks. It can also be available 24/7 and can streamline  processes like data collection, compilation sorting information and risk  reporting.

# Accounts Payable

Accounts payable is a simple yet repetitive process in banking. The  process involves producing customer information, validation, and process  payment. As this is a rule-based process, RPA can be implemented  undoubtedly in this case. RPA along with the help of optical character  recognition (OCR) facilitates the automation of the above process. OCR  reads the customer information from a scanned copy of the physical form  and feeds it to the RPA system. The system validates the data and  processes the payment. If an error occurs, It can notify the agent on  necessary actions.

# Credit cards and Loan Processing

The conventional credit card and loan application processing is a  time and labor intensive task. This task is tedious to the staff and  also displeasing to the customers, with RPA adoption, banks can swift  this process. RPA system can integrate and communicate with multiple  systems coherently, to fetch and validate the data and uses AI’s  decision making to either approve or reject the application.

# Fraud Detection

Along with the pros, the digital revolution has also brought some  cons and the notable one is FRAUD. Since financial institutions deal  with volume data, it’s hard for them to monitor all the customer  interactions to identify malicious activity. RPA comes to bank’s aid in  such scenarios, RPA deployed system has the ability to identify the  probable fraud transactions, recognizing the logical patterns in  real-time. It also can prevent fraud by notifying the executive/customer  on an unusual transaction.

# KYC Process

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a mandatory process for most of the  financial services companies. If manually done, it requires hundreds of  employees to validate the customer information. According to Thomson  Reuters, banks spend more than $384 million per year on KYC process  compliance. In order to minimize FTEs, reduce costs and to save an  adequate amount of time, the financial service providers are adopting  RPA to their business operations. RPA implementation in such process  minimizes human errors with 100% accuracy.

# General Ledger

To create accurate financial statements, the general ledger must be  updated with information such as revenue, assets, liabilities,  expenses.etc., this information needs to be gathered from different  legacy systems, that needs to be validated before publishing to a  general ledger.

Management of this huge data is prone to errors and inaccuracy.

RPA resolves this complexity, being powerful and technology  independent, it can be integrated with any system to collect data of  multiple formats. This also saves a lot of data handling time and  maintains accuracy.

# Report Automation

Creating an error-free and accurate report consumer a huge amount of  and time and number of employees. But still, doesn’t completely  eradicate the human error. RPA systems can collect data in multiple  formats, create reports by auto-filling the extracted data in the  required format and produce reports without errors at minimal cost and  time.

"Absolute Abundance— I wish to share with you a flash story about technostism (x-post /r/Technostism)That cool morning in the age of Orwell's Heaven, I ate breakfast, kissed my gynoid, and bought paper. Why not sit down at the table and dream new tales? Writing's easy and cathartic and my passion. And all year round, I would sit there, crafting wonders— making love to empty pages until midnight. Dawnlight starshine over pearl skies was my reward. I felt alive. Droids secured me a fine living. They would labor with the finest accuracy. Fabricators made everything for me freely with precision down to atoms at my leisure. Always high-end, they erased all class divisions. Droids served me well, decorating the finest sweets. They downloaded prior knowledge from their comrades. So they worked with infinite skills for maintenance. My house was cleaned, the roads repaired to perfection. Then when I said, ""Build me new rooms for my newborn,"" they went to work building my house like a mansion.

My gynoid worked as CEO of a business, making millions for me so vicariously. More droids were built to be sold off to networkers. Worker co-ops became technates across the globe. Networkers used and exploited these new age slaves to fix the world and to create fabricators. More built robots to do their work and support them. Droids fixed the parks. Droids fixed all roads. Droids cleaned junkyards— and the forests and the oceans effortlessly. Wealth spread around and there was no more poverty on Earth for good. Failed businesses were nothing more than slight bummers, for one could send droids into the massive workforce for their daily bread and help them try once again.

She has returned into my arms forever more."

"[Question] [Discussion] [Project] Tips for Beginner RobotHello, I am new to Robotics, I have been chosen by my School to present the school in the upcoming Division Science Fair and Quiz Plus. I was tasked to make a Robot that can help the environment under the category “Science Investigatory Project: Robotics” My Idea for the robot is that it will roam around a school or office collecting trash, after a round of collecting trash, I will press an input to signal the robot to bring back the trash it has collected and dispose it to an Automated Garbage Sorter, the Garbage Sorter will sort the trash automatically if it is Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable or Recyclable, and it will then send the trash to it’s properly segregated trash bins. I have been told that Arduino is good for beginners in robotics, The things is, I don’t know what should I get (Modules, Sensors, Boards, etc). I would like some help on making my idea come to fruition.

TL:DR - I need help in making a trash collecting robot using Arduino, what should I get and how should I do it."
"A Mathematician Learning Robotics (Reading/Resource Recommendations)So, to keep a long story short, I'm a mathematician doing R&D in machine learning for automation, and have mostly been working with using vision to work with organic products in new ways, such as effective grading methods or analysis on pre-plant embryos. However, I am starting to experiment using reinforcement learning for problems in robotics using simulations provided by openAI, as the lab I work for has found many problems when it comes to using robots to plant things. Due to the inconsistency of organic products, parameters that work for planting one specimen may damage another, or not work at all. My biggest issue is that since I come from a mathematics background, my understanding of automation and robotics is fairly limited in scope. I'm looking for some reading material and some sort of kit to teach me about how to engineer and interact with robots properly. Anything you can suggest is greatly appreciated!"

"Harnessing SimplicitySo I got punted over here by /u/Quipster99

I'm a software developer who first got exposed to automation when I got a co-op to automate collecting sound recordings from an ultrasound set up over a fake carotid artery. If that sounds impressive I want to stress how unimpressive I am. I'm not an amazing programmer. I'm average. Yet I had the ability to harness knowledge far greater then my own. In the end my efforts produced something that had below millimeter precision that shot a frequency through molded plastic and captured every aspect of the resonance. Doing insane math to give me what the fluid looked like at the moment, able to track individual molecules as they tumbled through the phantom.

To this day I want to build my own robot just because it was the coolest fucking thing I ever did. I'm on my way too. It's tough to raise funds but I'm slowly putting together my own Mendela Prusa 3D printer. I want to do it this way so I can have full control.

I really like this stuff is what I'm saying. I know a lot of you are probably interested in the robotics side of automation but I wanted to present to you guys some of my ideas and work on harnessing simplicity.

The robot I made was really complicated. It was automated but it had a fairly large flaw. It wasn't adaptable to things. If you presented it with something it didn't know how to deal with it simply crashed. It would gladly do what you told it. Which means you always get the results you want but you never get anything you weren't expecting either.

[Take Conway's game of life for example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). That is an example of harnessing simplicity for a purpose. It is one of the most basic examples I can think of. Binary itself is another one. By turning a transistor from the real world into a binary value we can repeat the process to get computation. That simple property of on and off used to produce results in orders of magnitude.

Terrain generation in games is something I can think of that shows how simple rules can expand out to create things that aren't designed but are complex. The complexity arising through the minor mechanics of the simplicity. [I took the idea of the game of life for instance and made something that generates little islands for a resource trading game I'm working on](http://i.imgur.com/cy15v7D.jpg). Randomly seeded data uses simple rules to boil down into a smattering of islands. To draw any of the results myself would take forever and yet I can produce almost and infinite number of them by tweaking the seed minorly.

That game itself is me trying to harness simplicity. I have pirates in it that have very simple rules. If they aren't looking at you they turn towards you, if they are not close to you they move forward. If the rate they are turning means they can't turn quick enough to get you they slow down. Finally when they are lined up with you and close enough they fire.

Its just very simple mathematics but in the end they give the perception of some sort of AI because they are using at least simple reasoning. Its not sophisticated but its oddly intelligent. They factor in your velocity as well so they seem to be having more going on upstairs then move around. None of this involves anything beyond giving a dot simple rules on how to get to another dot. And then [Pirates!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBx_85vByXc)

I'm finally having success with some of these concepts. However going forward with this stuff the same principals of automation I am applying to the pirates figuring things out I can apply to say 3D space. Where I could design 3D shapes based on simple rules.

This is where the recent advances in technology get me really really excited. By utilizing simplicity I can vastly improve my automation. I could in theory build a game that used an algorithm to try and solve how to build a bridge between two things. If this was done reasonably well the same way I can produce complex islands I could produce bridges that would support things.

Now what if the game physics and world was a decent representation of something in the real world? I could actually feed that data out to my printer and construct the bridge. I'm not an engineer but it would be insanely strong or it would not be solved one or the other. The power of simplicity giving me access to knowledge and building techniques I could never ever have thought up.

I really feel that our next leap forward in computing will not be in more power but using that power more intelligently. We have massive amounts of processing power that we burn on pretty trivial shit. If we re-imagine logic to not be something that is rigid but that massive logic systems can become organic if built correctly. Lets say I design a computer program that can perform key strokes, I also hook it up to a genetic algorithm. By figuring out the right variables I could set up a scenario where the computers one mission would be to find the correct combination of key strokes and mouse movements to hack into another computer. It would need to find its way onto the other computer, install itself and make a connection.

This would take a long fucking time but theoretically its possible for it to solve that problem. A clever enough algorithm could work. Taking small steps to figure out how to move around the computer its on first. Eventually if it made its way onto the other computer then it has a working model. By getting the two talking they can co-ordinate theoretically to get onto another computer. Eventually you could get the growing hoard to find its way onto more and more machines by endlessly trying every combination they can. Once it finds how to do it to a machine it records it and then can instantly jump onto whatever hurdle it solved.

I don't know how that won't happen some day. The rules of infinite complexity from simplicity means its totally possible. This is the power I'm so fascinated by. Its the power of life itself. For so long we tried to figure out what life is. We might not ever crack the secrets of DNA but what if we don't need to? What if we stole their tools of simplicity and did whatever we wanted with them. Being able to apply the principals of DNA to more and more things removed from biology is totally fascinating to me.

Anyways that's why I love the idea of harnessing simplicity. I can be pretty average and by utilizing repetition I can create things far more complicated then my mind alone would produce.

If you guys find this stuff interesting let me know, I fucking love it."

They buy more tools, equipment, and workspaces out of their earnings, or make their own using what they already have. Lastly, they accumulate funding, materials, energy, parts, and other resources to work with. Member goals include meeting most or all of their personal needs, be self-supporting, economically secure, and able to help new people by growing the existing network or starting new ones.

 A fully developed network would be able to make everything members want, including copying all their equipment and supplying new starter sets. A self-contained production chain, from raw materials to finished products, makes self-expansion and upgrade easier and less expensive. ""Smart tools"", which exploit automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence, can grow efficiently with little labor. A new network won't start out with all these abilities, but would grow into them a step at a time.  As owners of the smart tools, they are not at risk from labor displacement.  They still benefit from the tools, no matter how smart they get.

----
The ""Seed Factories"" subreddit has a link to a paper on ""Smart Tools and Self-Expanding Systems"" which goes into more depth on this subject.  It's a fairly long paper, so there is also a shorter slide presentation on ""Maker Networks"" (MakerNets)"" that covers the main points.

"Only One 2020 Presidential Candidate Has Warned America about Automation  

Martin Ford is a technology expert and writer whose 2015 book [**Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future**](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Robots-Technology-Threat-Jobless/dp/0465059996/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) woke up a lot of people about the fundamental changes automation will bring to the workplace and employment economy.

The [book got my attention](https://www.limitstogrowth.org/articles/2015/05/28/rise-of-the-robots-author-martin-ford-speaks-in-san-francisco/) in particular about how insane it is to continue immigrating millions of low-skilled foreigners when many of the jobs they take will be obsolete for human workers in just a few years.

The word is gradually getting out that the technology of robots, automation and AI needs attention for the threat it poses, although today’s booming economy makes that future easy to ignore.

"What will be the social implications when *EVERYTHING* is automated in the future?I'm sorry if this question looks like that generic decade old ""how will I make money when robots take my job"" question, but that's not what I'm asking here.
I'm talking about the long term, maybe a century in the future, when the automation, and specially the IT automation are capable of anything we humans do. This is not a moral question about Artificial Intelligence either, but when the AI is so powerful it can literally do every single thing we can apart from emotions (maybe), that is, every single job including creative jobs, when computer will take over not only the assembly line of a factory but the job of engineers, architects, artists, (maybe even programmers?), and they get the capability to do test and research by itself, that is, even scientists won't be needed any longer, then what will there be left for us to DO?
Not talking about money anywhere here, as I believe in the universal wage system (like Finland tried to do), and many other solutions, but I'm talking about the social questions, what the hell are we going to do all day long? Sunbath? Lay in bad and watch movies (made by machines, as actors, directors, even producers will no longer be needed as a single computer can make an entire movie by itself) all day long? Become vegetables? Become stupid because there's no longer a reason to learn physics, chemistry, math, arts, as the machines do EVERYTHING including art and scientific research for us?

I'm sorry if has been asked before but I did not know how to search google for this specific question as everything I searched ended up on the wage problem."

"Graduate in Robotics and Industrial Automation Struggling to find JobsHello Reddit community,

I am a graduate with a degree in Robotics and Industrial Automation, but I am struggling to find any entry-level jobs in my field. Even though I have solid knowledge of Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC, Fanuc and ABB robots all the job postings I come across require previous experience which I don't have. I tried connecting people on LinkedIn , applying to many companies on Indeed and even sending emails to automation companies but none of them was fruitful

Despite working as a machine operator for the past year to make ends meet, I am not seeing any career growth in this role. I am eager to start my career in the field I studied and passionate about, but I don't know how to overcome this hurdle of lack of experience.

I would appreciate any guidance or support that you can offer. Are there any specific skills or certifications that I should focus on? Is there a particular approach I should take in my job search? Any advice from those who have gone through a similar experience or from those who work in the field would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help and support."

"RPA (Robotic Process Automation) 

RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is considered a relatively new phase of technology that is already making a significant impact in many industries, including finance and accounting. RPA can help organizations transform their operations by automating routine and repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more value-added activities.

RPA has the potential to significantly improve accuracy and efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the overall customer experience. It can also help organizations better manage their data, allowing for faster and more informed decision-making.

In addition to these operational benefits, RPA also has the potential to drive cultural and organizational change. By automating routine tasks, organizations can create a more agile and flexible work environment that is better equipped to adapt to the ever-changing demands of the business world.

However, it is important to note that RPA is not a one-size-fits-all solution and that proper implementation is key to realizing its full potential. Organizations need to carefully select the processes that are most suitable for automation, provide adequate training and support to end users, and ensure a seamless integration with existing systems and processes.

Overall, RPA is a promising technology that has the potential to drive significant transformation in the way organizations operate and compete in the digital and data-driven world."

"Exploring Realistic Automated PodcastsFor a hackathon, A friend and I challenges ourselves to create a ""this day in history"" style podcast using AI. We wanted to see how high-quality we could get using the latest tech.

Frankly, we were shocked by how good V1 is.

Check it our here: [https://open.spotify.com/show/6HD4xYgKcDYYYKVqtUTcHv?si=55c3bf7383c84f50](https://open.spotify.com/show/6HD4xYgKcDYYYKVqtUTcHv?si=55c3bf7383c84f50)

We've used AI to help us write the script, generate voiceovers, produce background music, and even create the thumbnail. As of now, we have released 13 episodes, with a new episode coming out each day.  


We are using Soundful for the music, Midjourney for the Thumbnail, GPT-4 for the Script, ElevenLabs for the voices, and my partner is doing the editing. With that we are taking roughly an hour to complete podcast. We plan on stringing everything together so we can do as little as possible while maintaining a high level of quality.  


We are so surprised by the podcast's quality that we are going to be doing more shows with various themes soon. I'm happy to answer any questions people may have about our process or thinking behind the project."
"10 Advantages Of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)At [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/), we provide solutions that integrate [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), with business intelligence software and AI technology to improve various logistics scenarios and enable efficient and flexible operations. With a large portfolio of successful cases, we've listed some of the advantages of [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products).

**1. Tripling the productivity of order fulfillment**

When there are multiple orders received, the [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' system will carry out multi-order picking. It controls the picking robot to carry a corresponded rack with multiple SKUs to the workstation for order picking by workers. Hence, a single pick can fulfill multiple orders. Workers do not have to spend time walking, looking for ordered items, on a specific shelf in scattered locations of the warehouse. Therefore, workers can focus on order picking only. This helps to increase the picking productivity by 300% when compared to the manual operation.

**2. Lower Labor Costs**

[MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' AMR system also enables the optimization of labor. With this system, workers can spend all the working hours focusing on order picking only. When order picking becomes more efficient, it means fewer workers can achieve the same or much higher picking productivity than manual operation. This helps reducing labor costs. 

**3. No Single Point of Failure**

By implementing [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), warehouses can ensure continued operations and mitigate against issues associated with single-point-of-failure, which are common in operations relying on fixed infrastructure e.g operation may shut down when the conveyor belt is broken. If an AMR breaks down, it can be easily fixed and replaced without affecting the operation.

**4. Flexible to Scale Up and Down**

The number of robots as well as hours of work per day can be easily adjusted to meet changes in demand even if there is an unexpected peak or off-peak season. Businesses can now avoid the difficulties associated with finding labor under various peak scenarios and the time associated with hiring and then training new staff. Through real-time monitoring and inventory control, the scheduling of [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can dynamically adjusted following incoming demands. 

It also enables businesses to expand their scale in different stages. For example, deploying automation in one part of the warehouse and automating other parts later by adding more robots for the increasing demand in the future.   


https://preview.redd.it/jv7umeor26k91.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4316073e06ea7a770dc320a914c108f583c4a882

**5. Fast deployment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be flexibly implemented without the costs associated with fixed infrastructure. The mobility, autonomy, and size make them easy to implement into the existing warehouse. The infrastructures are required only as simple as five components: robots, workstation, WiFi, Shelf & QR code. Therefore, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be easily installed and can go-live within 1-3 months.

**6. Higher Storage Capacity**

The total number of storage bin locations will increase. As the storage bin locations are customized for specific SKUs, therefore, each bin location can be fully utilized to store the same items. This ensures there is no space being wasted.

**7. More Accurate Operations** 

Errors can have several explanations, however, avoiding them is becoming increasingly important as people have higher demands for faster and accurate services. By deploying [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), you can avoid errors associated with manual operations like stress brought on during peak, new staff, and increasingly difficult logistics scenarios like reverse logistics.

**8. Safer Operations** 

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are designed to work dynamically with their surroundings and are highly responsive. By using built-in sensors, laser scanner, and intelligent algorithms, it can detect workers or obstacles and then adjust the route. This allows for a safe and collaborative environment of AMRs and warehouse workers.

**9. Improve the working environment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)deployment is not simply replacing human works. Workers are still the most essential element in the operation. They are going to equip more skills to control the system and collaborate with the [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products). Therefore, deploying [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)is creating an ergonomic working process for workers and increasing their value to the business. 

**10. Flexible Relocation**

Imagine your warehouse needs to relocate due to costs or changes in business, in that case, moving the warehouse infrastructure can be a struggle and large additional cost may be involved in uninstalling. Unlike fixed infrastructure, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are easy to relocate and can enable a quick transition period.

I start to have a decent grasp on RPA, and I feel like it is a trap. Am I wrong ? Why ?

>>- Everything could be done with traditional software instead  
>>- A bot is tightly coupled with the piece(s) of software it fixes  
>
>Consequently, maintaining bots on top of software may end-up being a total nightmare. Indeed, if your software provider (say Microsoft, SAP, Notepadd++, ...) updates its user interface and/or features, your bots may not work anymore and may have to be retrained.

I was tasked to make a Robot that can help the environment under the category “Science Investigatory Project: Robotics” My Idea for the robot is that it will roam around a school or office collecting trash, after a round of collecting trash, I will press an input to signal the robot to bring back the trash it has collected and dispose it to an Automated Garbage Sorter, the Garbage Sorter will sort the trash automatically if it is Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable or Recyclable, and it will then send the trash to it’s properly segregated trash bins. I have been told that Arduino is good for beginners in robotics, The things is, I don’t know what should I get (Modules, Sensors, Boards, etc). I would like some help on making my idea come to fruition.

"PoC for processing utility invoices -> AWS route vs uiPath route - trying to understand high level adv vs disadvantages if someone can help me please So lets say I get 100 invoices every month, these invoices must be properly categorized and relative fields must be uploaded into a db for accountant to post. The system must be able to tell which invoice belongs to which property, what type it is, any minute detail depending on accountants needs must be incorporated. The system will have to reference lookup table to get certain data like account number etc.

Lets assume half of these invoices are unique in the sense that they are different vendors and have different formats. One invoice can have a overdue section from previous bill, then next month not have that, so the system must be able to adapt to changing data. Another invoice can have various fields which another invoice might not.

The current process is done manually - received by mail not email or online copy, and user has to look at each invoice, figure out gl code, etc etc.

Right now I am doing a PoC with AWS reps using textract and python to develop something that can process these invoices. We have the ability to switch over to online pdf copies/email copies instead of doing the scan in manual way.

What I am trying to understand is what kind of advantage something like UiPath or another RPA would give in this process. I believe UiPath uses abbyy OCR, which I don't think is best for my use case because they don't extract in key value pairs like textract does, thus I would have to do more logic implementation just to get the right values with the right keys (right?)

But looking for other positives/negatives so I can do a proper assessment on both tools. Would anyone have experience with UiPath here or any RPA implementation?

Personally I feel like RPA is just good for ""robotic, doesn't change much same steps every time process"" but not sure how well it would do in changing document types and implementing various logic to do what the PoC is doing now. Looking for a high level on adv vs disadv if possible.

Thanks!"
"[observation] Why current robots fail at walking.When we see the current state of biped robots, then we can laugh at how they fail at walking obstacles. Robots with 4 legs do better, but they also fall and fail.

The problem is not the robot, nor the limit of technology. The real issue is gravity and the **human bias** to design a shape that is not good for walking.

Here are the examples of the current state of biped robots, that are supposed to be the best in class:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeFkrwagYfc

If the robots would need to walk, then they would need to have flexible limbs. The limbs that have smaller modules that can change the shape of the limb during the movement, so that the limbs can shift the weight and escape gravity.

The walking robots do need to shift their weight, during the movement. The current robots have only one large gyro or so. They do not move the limbs to balance during the walking.

The walking robots will not be safe, if they continue to have stiff limbs that do not shift their weight during the walking.

The walking robots do need a small gyro in every module of the limb. They need to balance the total weight with the help of decentralized gyros, or with the fast movement of the limbs.

Counterbalance is important.

It would be possible to use a tail or extra arms that would balance the body of the robot out, but I think the small gyros in the limbs would be better, because the electric motor of the gyro can react within milliseconds, while it would be much difficult to move the limb in the same amount of time.

The walking robots will continue to fail, until they can shift their weight dynamically in 100 milliseconds or so. Until then, the push of the wind or the slippery floor will make them fail.

Any experiences, ideas or thoughts on this ?"
"Robotic Process Automation: A Revolution in Process Automation 

In this age of tremendous technological innovations, automation seems  to attract experts to turn business more efficient and rapid. In  precise, [Robotic Process Automation](http://www.athenagt.com/roboticprocessautomation)  attracts organizations as an emerging technology which automates  tedious process of employees.

Imagine the performance of a business application modified with RPA,  it’s beyond your expectation. This is an intelligent automation process  which uses self-learning techniques by incorporating predictive and  cognitive computing. It reduces errors, minimizes human intervention in  process and also lessens irregularity in automated workflows. Although  enterprises stay abreast of new technologies, the trend continues with  integration of various work models.

**RPA, An impeccable technology in present digital-first age**

Concept of RPA can be explained as, software agents called “bots” are  programmed to perform iterative and monotonous, rules-based tasks that  are done by humans earlier. Such bots accomplish tasks such as handling  queries, transactions, manipulating data and log maintenance faster with  utmost accuracy. RPA is compatible with many applications like HTML,  .NET, and JAVA.

**What makes RPA stand out among different automation processes?** 

Besides the ability to perform repeatable tasks, it encompasses  cognitive intelligence. It uses AI, machine learning and speech  recognition, from that evolves self-learning bots having the ability to  analyse situations and correct faults. RPA tools like Blue Prism,  Automation Anywhere, UiPath and OpenSpan are used to automate certain  business processes. Programed bots using RPA tools has the ability to  manage and operate the data by interacting with various digital  integrations.

**RPA with Machine learning and Artificial intelligence**

RPA can automate certain process but its ability gets limited if it  involves decision making which requires application knowledge. ML comes  to use in this scenario, it helps construct a learning base dependent on  chronicle information and utilizes it for decision making and  forecasts.

Symbiosis of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capacities  advance business processes executed by RPA systems in better decision  making and efficient outputs. The data generated by RPA tools powers  AI’s analytical ability to attain profound understanding, which in turn  expands RPA adoption.

The combination of ML and RPA can make automation powerful. ML being  an emerging technology requires experts having deep knowledge abilities  to develop error-free ML models. RPA deployment being customer centric,  enterprises can adapt intelligent automation solutions that in turn  result in ROIs along with ML and AI.

**The utilization of RPA upgrades quality and limits the chance of errors**

As indicated by the RPA specialists, this innovation is sufficient to  change company’s perpetual work style and enables genuine satisfaction  to clients. There is zero chance of monotonous chores, business costs  are decreased and the workforce is occupied with more essential  undertakings and it upgrades the efficiency of the business.

"[Discussion] The Importance of Artificial IntelligenceAlong with machine learning and big data, **artificial intelligence** (AI) has transformed the field of technology in recent years. Despite this, the concept of artificial intelligence is quite vague, and its importance even more so. Some believe that AI may potentially take over the world, while others envision an advanced age powered by automotive cars and robots. Whether it be a dystopia or a futuristic world, the significance of AI is undeniable. What has AI done in recent years, and where is it headed?

Currently, AI is capable of reading, writing, hearing, debating, and even understanding emotions. Algorithms have been shown **outperforming the world’s best** Go and Chess players because of their fast processing speed and ability to store thousands of play variations. AI is already a surprisingly large part of our everyday lives, and here are some examples:

1. The spam filters built within our email systems actually incorporate AI, as spam filters must continually learn from a variety of signals for recognition efficiency. Additionally, it further personalizes the results based on what an individual personally considers spam. Every individual has nuanced methods of categorizing whether something is spam or not, what you consider spam may be beneficial to someone else. With this technology, Gmail successfully [filters 99.9%](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/07/the-mail-you-want-not-spam-you-dont.html) of spam![ ](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/07/the-mail-you-want-not-spam-you-dont.html)
2. The recommendations shopping websites employ for its consumers are also based on their algorithms associating certain products with previous ones that customers may have browsed or purchased. Amazon’s recommendations are heavily personalized to suggest products that are most relevant for their customers to purchase. An astounding [35% of customer purchases](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) are a result of their recommendation engine.[ ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers)
3. In the finance field, banks and corporations have been utilizing AI. Mobile check deposits decipher and convert handwriting into text, which eliminates the need to physically deliver a check. With the sheer number of transactions that occur on a daily basis, AI has also been helpful in detecting and thus decreasing fraudulent activity. 

Therefore, AI has been developed to improve society’s quality of life and automate repetitive tasks that previously required human effort. As the leader of technological growth, AI and its capabilities will lead to further societal progress. In recent years, AI has been instrumental in **analyzing data and integrating information**, which is arguably one of its most essential purposes

My end goal is hopefully to get into a technician position and later going back to get my full bachelor's engineering degree. I want to try and future proof my career, so I'm trying to focus more on the design, programming, plc, and robotics side. Worse case I've done well so far in the mechanical side I can drop into a maintenance department. 

I'm open to any advice, just trying to figure out where I wanna full set my sights going forward these next 2 years so I can land without hitting hitting rocks hopfully."
"Software for controlling Mitsubishi RV-2AJHello Friends,

I recently found and am trying to resurrect an automatic arm I found at work. The arm is Mistubish RV-2AJ (5 axis arm) and controller CR1-571. 

Now I am just starting to learn about PLC (my background is in Tissue Engineering) and I have scoured the interwebs for freeware to control this robot. There are some paid for software that I would like to avoid, as the whole purpose of getting this robot running is to bring it to my daughters first grade class to get them interested in robotics. 

What I have found so far is that this particular robot/controller combo runs on two types of code - MELFA Basic IV and MoveMaster Command. 

Does anyone know if there is any open software to control this robot/teach this robot? Do you think it is possible to command via serial?

Any help would get greatly appreciated!

Thank you!"

EDIT: I really don't think I want to spend my life writing software."
"RPA had been gaining popularity lately. What is it and what benefits does it offer to the major industries? I know a bit but would appreciate inputs from you people.Let's start with what I Know.

# Take traditional automation, add complex layers, integrate other automation technologies like Machine Learning, AI, Artificial Neural Network, and more- that’s RPA for you.

In a nutshell,

# RPA is traditional automation 2.0.

But if we were to discuss the traditional definition,

**Robotic Process Automation, in the simplest of sense, interprets and captures repetitive processes to trigger automated responses, initiate new actions, and establish communication signals with other systems.**

**Cool, right?**

## What are the major RPA Platforms?

**The automation market is flooded with RPA vendors, but truth be told, only 3 major players dominate the entire automation sphere:**

1. [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/)
2. [Automation Anywhere](https://www.automationanywhere.com/)
3. [Blue Prism](https://www.blueprism.com/)

**Here’s a quick comparison of the three platforms, for your reference:**

&#x200B;

|Features|UiPath|Automation Anywhere|Blue prism|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Intuitive UI/UX|User-friendly drag and drop designer|User-friendly designer|Requires great programming skillset|
|Customer-Demand|Most Popular with Individuals & Organizations|Popular with Organizations|Popular with developers and programmers|
|Trial-Version|Yes, through a community Edition|No Free-trial is available|Free-trial for 30 days is available|

&#x200B;

You can directly visit their website, sign-up, and test automation for your business; however, the better alternative would be to opt for RPA implementation services provided by an associated and certified RPA implementation Partner.

**Moving on, here are the key industries that benefit from business process automation and advanced RPA technologies:**

* **Insurance**

RPA helps in automating repetitive and mundane tasks in Insurance, such as analyzing the immense volumes of data, entering them into associated spreadsheets, and rendering valuable insights- if and when prompted.

* **Banking**

RPA assists banking and other financial institutions with customers’ satisfaction by automating tasks including but not limited to booking appointments, pulling and entering data into CRMs, and fraud detection.

* **Finance**

Through smart RPA bot implementation, you can monitor and regulate processes including claim administration, medical billing, cost compliance, patients’ records, and a lot more.

* **Manufacturing**

RPA bots improve the accuracy of data, quicken production lines, and ensures on-time shipment of products.

* **Human Resources**

USE RPA to automate processes like recruiting, accessing, vetting, and processing employees- for all these make up for a part of an HR’s job profile.

**The list is inexhaustive, so be aware that RPA benefits aren’t constrained to these particular industries. That is to say, if your business doesn’t fall under one of these categories, don’t fret.**

**You still can, and in fact, must- implement RPA in your business processes.**

**To know more about RPA, head over to this blog where we cover every aspect of** [Robotic Process Automation.](https://www.signitysolutions.com/blog/rpa-robotic-process-automation/)

**I ensure you, you’d have a decent knowledge of RPA if you can mindfully read the said blog post- end-to-end.**

Rest up, if you can add some valuable input, please go ahead."
"List of jobs most in decline due to automationEvery March, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases a detailed table of employment by occupation for the previous May. They study May because it's not significantly affected by seasonal employment, and they release in March because, like with any survey, in order to get a representative sample of small subsets of the population, you have to survey a very large number of people. By March, the BLS will have run 10 surveys of 145,000 businesses each and will have asked about May each time. Still, a 35% rise in private chefs from 400 to 540 people could just be statistical noise, so I'll ignore the truly tiny occupations.

The 2013 table will come out this March, but I've used a database to cross-reference the [2010 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2010/may/oes_nat.htm) and [2012 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2012/may/oes_nat.htm) to try to find which jobs are losing the most workers, and to try to determine which declines may be due to automation.

Between 2010 and 2012, total US employment rose from 127 million to 130 million workers, or 2.51%. So anything not rising by 2.51% is falling behind.

Here are the occupations that stood out to me as likely affected by automation, by percentage of job loss from 2010 to 2012. This list primarily focuses on jobs affected by computerization and digitization rather than robotics. This is because jobs currently affected by robotics are largely in manufacturing, but since manufacturing is returning to America as robotics slashes manufacturing labor costs, American manufacturing employment is actually up even though the number of people required to manufacture, say, a set volume of textiles has [fallen by over 90 percent](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html) since 1980. There's a predictable theme of all manner of office administrators and bookkeepers being replaced by software, with many computer workers, people who thought they had learned the skills of the future, simply being replaced by computers outright. Remember that these changes are over just a two-year timespan.

    Cashiers                        -1.20%  -40,160

Feel free to ask about any of these occupations and how they're being automated. The biggest decline in sheer numbers is among executive secretaries and administrative assistants, down by 329,000 workers, a 29% fall, in just two years. In fact, this category has declined by 47% since 2007, as software is being used to automate these job functions away.

There's also a very large number of traditional trades that would overwhelm the list, but that no one is surprised are in decline, such as woodworkers and hand sewers. Many occupations in government, especially teachers, are in decline, as many governments have pursued an austerity strategy. The real estate and construction trades fell, since housing didn't really start rising again until 2013. Entertainment jobs are also down as entertainment goes digital and production goes international. Some jobs are simply evolving or being reclassified, such as computer programmers (-5.04%) becoming app developers (+17.44%), home health aides (-14.54%) becoming personal care aides (+43.61%), or telecom line installers (-14.91%) becoming cell tower installers (+64.55%), which was the second-fastest growing occupation on the list in percentage terms. Number 1 was models (+324.51%), but there are only 4,330 people classified as models, up from just 1,020, so statistical noise could be a factor. Another interesting shift is from chief executives (-6.42%) to general managers (+11.20%). General managers includes small business owners. Corporate consolidation could be a factor there.

The fastest growing umbrella categories of occupations by sheer numbers were food prep and serving (+519,540), sales (+397,110), and personal care (+385,530), with the great majority of the growth in the last category being from elderly care.

As /r/Automate has detailed, there are a lot of technologies ready to attack the food prep and serving category, from [tablet ordering at the table](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/03/tablets_at_restaurants_applebee_s_chili_s_race_to_eliminate_human_interaction.html) to [automated assembly-line kitchens](http://www.gizmag.com/hamburger-machine/25159/) to [vending machines that cook meals](http://www.letspizza.co.uk/) to 30-minute drone delivery to the home a la [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011).

As for elder care, many robots are in development to take care of the elderly, including robots that [monitor vital signs, detect falls, remind people to take medicine, find people who wander](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_o7bFbzMRM#t=27), [transport linens, serve refreshments, provide entertainment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx0zxr3D_zU), even [provide companionship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46sEGwiVO18). But given population trends, even if robots do address elder care, the sheer increase in demand from demographics could help protect workers in this field.

That leaves sales. The main growth here is in retail salespersons, which excludes cashiers, an occupation in decline. The BLS description of a retail salesperson is that they ""sell merchandise, such as furniture, motor vehicles, appliances, or apparel to consumers."" Furniture, cars and appliances are among the goods least conducive to online sales: They're expensive purchases that people want to examine in person before departing with large sums of cash, they're heavy products that are costly to ship, and the prospect of packing up and returning them if you're dissatisfied is daunting. But auto sales could decline as cheap or even [free self-driving taxis](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/google-patents-ad-powered-taxi-service-that-would-offer-free-rides-to-shoppers/) turn the car from a major purchase into an affordable service that arrives at your door. As for clothing, people want to try on clothes before they buy them. There are some businesses that try to work around this, whether by photographing you and creating a virtual fitting room or by sending you a large selection of clothes to try on and charging you only for what you don't return. But perhaps the most promising effort to automate clothing retail is a store that uses [hidden robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KSw28CnRhY) to replace a lot of the retail workforce. Most of the rest of the increase in the sales category is in a vague ""sales representatives, other"" category. My guess is that pharmaceutical reps, among other B2B reps, could hold a significant share of these jobs, but I simply don't know.

The three largest occupation umbrella categories in 2012, regardless of growth, are office and administrative support, sales, and food prep and serving. I've addressed those, but the fourth largest category is interesting: transportation and material moving. The 8.8 million workers in this category are likely in serious jeopardy from self-driving vehicles and robotic machinery that can handle freight.

You can parse the data yourself [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWPO6GB3DyjdFZuanFFNlJRSVhISkphRXNCUFNFTkE&usp=sharing#gid=0). You can download or copy the data to sort or otherwise manipulate it. And again, feel free to discuss and debate individual jobs and their vulnerability to automation.

**EDIT:** Removed several occupations after closer examination suggested they may be affected by reclassification."
"Automated withdrawal of fastener material from the warehouse. Any ideas?
Hello guys,

I work for a relatively big hi-tech company and I have a specific problem, which I need a helping hand with. 

Our WMS works relatively flawlessly in cooperation with our Kardex units to supply our BOMs - it is still a pick and place kind of situation, but since the parts are relatively big and easy to handle, it is very quick.

When it comes to fasteners, we have a separate unit of shelves, in which each item has a coded location of storage (each type of item also has a unique article number). Our warehouse workers then fulfill the requested BOMs by simply handpicking a certain amount of a desired type of fastener (one by one). This handpicking is ultimately very slow - 2 full-time workers are cumulatively used up by this fastener hand-picking process. This lead to an optimization in our fastener usage (unified screw heads, unified material etc.) to reduce the item article count. The problem however still stands.

My question:

Is there some kind of a robotic system, that would automatically withdraw said number of f.e. screws? Does not have to be very sofisticated, I am really looking for something that would withdraw a requested amount of a desired fastener. It has to be universal though - able to dose screws, nuts, washers etc.

Alternative question:

How do f.e. IKEA fill fastener material bags in their flatpacks? I am sure they do not do hand-picking."

"Assumptions businesses should stop making while implementing RPA 

Many companies in finance, insurance, banking, and healthcare  industries are opening their doors to Robotic Process Automation. Their  key drivers could be more than just ROI. The expectations could be on  Cost Reduction, Talent Focus, Quality Assurance, Scalability, Speed, and  Customer Satisfaction.

To achieve RPA success and reach business goals companies should  avoid the below assumptions. This helps in reaping RPA’s potential  benefits.

### 1. Every business process can be automated

RPA comes along with advantages like productivity, accuracy and cost  savings only when a valid process is automated. It is important to  understand that automation of well-defined logic based and low-level  cognitive tasks yields accurate results. Analyze every activity involved  in the process to check the worthiness of RPA implementation for the  particular process.

### 2. IT is enough to make a decision

Organizations must take care of change management while implementing  RPA. Relevant stakeholders should be involved in decision making other  than just IT team. , Implementing RPA involves new purchases and the  bot’s needs to be retrained based on process modification or change.  Hence it’s better to involve relevant teams like HR and operations team  along with IT in decision making to avoid rework.

### 3. Automating multiple processes at a time is an advantage

This no-code technology has to be deployed with much integration.  Hence, there is a probability of greater complexity in implementing  multiple processes at a time. As the bots are easy to be retrained,  organizations must prioritize processes for automation and implement it  one after the other to leverage RPA.

### 4. No post-implementation management required

We are living in a world where technological advancements take place  every moment. This changes business environment very often, and it’s  important for organizations to acknowledge the change to progress  towards growth. Hence it’s necessary to work on the modifications to  improve existing bots, in line with industry needs and technology  changes.

### 5. Process complexity doesn’t matter

Several factors must be considered before deciding to automate any  process. They include the definition of the process, the volume of data  associated with the process, diversity and cognitive level of the tasks.  All these factors combined indicate the process complexity.  Well-defined, low cognitive-level and repetitive tasks are most suitable  for RPA implementation with fewer complexities.

### 6. Full process automation save costs

A process contains multiple subprocesses with different levels of  complexities. It is not obvious that automating the entire process would  save costs. Though the majority of the process can be automated, there  may come a case when the implementation costs for the remaining process  might be much more. This may decrease ROI. Automating only the required  tasks optimizes process efficiency

This game-changing technology helps in building efficient  organizations only when it’s done right. Decision makers should  prioritize on what part of the process should be automated at the right  time. Through services like RPA consultation, Automation Lifecycle  Management, and Hosted Automation Athena help organizations to increase  ROI and achieve various benefits in terms of costs, efficiency, quality,  and productivity."
"Anybody working on farming automations? (Or know of one?) /r/farmtechAfter some discussion with others about the increase in automation technologies for farming. I found it hard to find a central place to learn more about opensource farming automations and how it might go when combined with other cutting edge farming technologies like ""vertical farming"".

So /r/farmtech is created to help spur discussion, and hopefully action/research into the future of democratising access to food through open access technologies. 

If you know of any technologies, or opensource projects that we should know of, please subscribe to our subreddit and post a thread on it. I will cross promote this with other subreddits (like /r/farming/ which is full of farmers) in the hope that we can get many people of different skills to work together on this very important field.

Any help is greatly appreciated."
"Thesis on RPA, what are some challenges you face?I'm starting an internship in a RPA business in a few weeks. I'm looking for a thesis subject regarding a current issue/problem of RPA (development).

What are some issues you come across while developing RPA-solutions, consulting with clients about RPA, or anything in between? Additional information (papers, webpages, blogs, anything) are greatly appreciated!

Some of my current directions I'm thinking of:

\- RPA combined with AI or Machine Learning isn't profitable enough short-term for most clients;  
\- RPA combined with AI has too many variables to easily implement;  
\- The data from RPA's are not insightful enough;  
\- The process of the RPA combined with human interaction is not insightful enough (not sure if the robot is doing stuff, or that it's a human's turn to do something).

I'm extremely new to RPA, searching the web I mainly find information about how businesses should get started using RPA, not so much about the development of it, or the issues in development of it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

📝 Editorial 

The recent emergence of pre-trained language models and transformer architectures pushed the creation of larger and larger machine learning models. Google’s BERT presented attention mechanism and transformer architecture possibilities as the “next big thing” in ML, and the numbers seem surreal. OpenAI’s GPT-2 set a record by processing 1.5 billion parameters, followed by Microsoft’s Turing-NLG, which processed 17 billion parameters just to see the new GPT-3 processing an astonishing 175 billion parameters. To not feel complacent, just this week Microsoft announced a new release of its DeepSpeed framework (which powers Turing-NLG), which can train a model with **up to a trillion parameters**. That sounds insane but it really isn’t.  

What we are seeing is a consequence of several factors. First, computation power and parallelization techniques have evolved to a point where it is relatively easy to train machine learning models in large clusters of machines. Second and most importantly, in the current state of machine learning, larger models have regularly outperformed smaller and more specialized models. Knowledge reusability methods like transfer learning are still in very nascent stages. As a result, it’s really hard to build small models that can operate in uncertain environments. Furthermore, as models like GPT-3 and Turing-NLG have shown, there is some unexplainable magic that happens after models go past a certain size.

Many of the immediate machine learning problems might be solved by scaling the current generation of neural network architectures. Plain and simple, when it comes to machine learning, size matters.  

We would love to hear your opinions about the debate between broader-larger vs. smaller and more specialized models.

"Can someone give me some groundbreaking, but specific, examples of automation that occurred in the last few years?We read about automation and its effects, but rarely seem to know the specifics.  For example, Nike just replaced 100,000+ jobs in third-world factories by automating the jobs.  How did they do this?  Is there some new shoe-making robot that just became possible?

What have the recent automation breakthrough products been?  For example, has Samsung just recently introduced a manufacturing robot that is now in high demand and is rapidly replacing humans in factories? 

Sorry, but automation just seems so abstract without concrete examples.  Can anyone help?"

"Manufacturing innovation tips?**How would you go about a project that attempts to innovate and create value in the form of an autonomous warehouse robot concept?**

*It's a project at my university but I feel hopeless insofar as real value proposition. My main goal with this post is to grasp a process/approach that would enable me to make something that, provided a high enough quality, could actually be turned into a real life project worth the resources and be implemented.*

&#x200B;

My elementary (but best) step-by-step approach would look something like this:

* **get to know warehouse operations as much as possible** (it is actually required that I come up with an innovative idea based on a marketing analysis but I don't really see how that helps formulating the concrete idea; in my understanding it might reveal if warehouse automation is a growing market and summarize the environment for developments)
* **investigate unautomated tasks that are possible to automate** *(hopefully there are at least a few)*
* **conduct an analysis that it is possible to produce the concept and assess the production costs** *(not required by uni but if I had a great idea I would, no doubt, do it)*
* **conduct an analysis to find out if the solution is a worthwhile financial investment for warehouses** *(same as with the previous point)*
* **build a prototype** *(requirement from the uni)*

Please prove me wrong and criticize any of my points, but right now I don't see a way of actually finding out a concept worthwhile of real life implementation. Ignore the limitations of my technical competencies to a reasonable extent (I sadly won't be able to create a comprehensive A.I. application that optimizes all warehouses just yet :D) and focus on how you would acquire enough information about warehouses that you create a new valuable automated solution.

*Thanks for reading it and I very much look forward to reading your insights and arguments. I'm really trying to motivate myself with identifying a real goal but I'm doubtful as it just seems too technologically specific of an area to innovate in as an outsider. Nonetheless, it still is my goal.*"
"Automating in a warehouseHi everyone, 

I'm a qualified mechatronics engineer and I've recently switched careers to sales and notice a lot of places where efficiency can be optimized.

The thing is a lot of our processes on the sales processing side are repetitive, slow and prone to error. If this was excel I'd easily be able to write a program to assist or automate but the software we use is old & foreign to me. 

How do I create a software that will be able to input to the current software we have? Is this a good solution? 
I know some python & c++ but haven't dabbled into writing software that inputs to other software, mainly just microcontrollers and robotics.

Chances of moving from our current system are pretty low. 

Cheers for any help.

I am looking for just some general help with warehouse automation and everything I've found on the web has been pretty unhelpful. Thanks in advance and I'll try and keep up with the comments.  "
"Vertical integration + automation + self-replicating resource business model ?As marginal cost and profit keep dropping due to technology, traditional businesses are having difficulty justifying investment into many areas (because they are not profitable or minimally profitable). However, it is material gain and conversion (via production) that we are concerned about (value add) and not necessarily paper profits when we talk about some kind of ""future economy"".

This is an idea that I've been trying to wrap my head around to fully comprehend the possibilities: a factory consumes energy in order to reconfigure matter into something we want. We are gaining an unprecedented amount of control over this process. Imagine a molecular assembler/disassembler; you throw in a chair, it decomposes to some organic atoms, then out pops something you want using those materials. We may not have that yet, but we can apply the same kind of zero-waste concept (or waste minimization) to a business model, and we can apply a level of automation.

Example: I begin with a basic resource, food, and work out from there. Plants are in some sense a factory; they take in solar energy and recombine organic materials into more complex ones. A hydroponics setup often has automated components, some to the point of actually having fully automated growing machines. You import organic materials, balance the chemicals, then harvest the part of the plant you want. The chemical inputs (and water) are essentially equal to the export, while the rest can be mostly recycled by decomposition or consumption by insects which are fed to fish in the case of an aquaponic system. The point is a closed system that recycles what's not being exported. Energy (solar generally) provides plenty of power in an efficient system. We are helping it along by optimizing resource availability.

Now, plants can make more than food. Consider building materials and textiles. Bio-plastics, plant fibers that can be made a strong as steel, and others (which we gain access to as we research more). These materials function as the output of the farm, but the input of a related business. How many things can be derived from plants (directly and with some minor manufacturing of our own)? Biological solar panels to replace manufactured ones?

Add to these systems automation. Maybe some of the outputs are inputs for a 3D printer? It becomes a vertically integrated system where the inputs (ie, the things that cost money) are minimized, including labor. Machines can work 24/7 and retain efficiency unless they break down.

So an initial seed of capital investment (money) creates the first greenhouse, solar installation, etc, but what if that greenhouse outputs bio-plastics which are used to make transparent insulated material from which I can save 20-30% of the cost on the next greenhouse? What if most of the structural materials to make a greenhouse are made in my farm? Maybe some plant fiber is compressed and made into ""Lego block"" type of units which form the structural foundation? Maybe I can go farther and create something which a 3D printer (or other robot) can assemble easily saving the construction labor?

So I have minimized my costs (in money) to create additional production chains, and am becoming more self-reliant and vertically integrated. The growth model if we mostly remove money/profits as the limitation could be staggering if we make a mostly-self-replicating environment. This mimics biology, which is already efficient. Then what is critical (and I haven't fully understood the best way) is to decentralize it (already done by replicating in different places) and democratize this as a social business, selling at or near cost. This is sort of a post-capitalism idea, and I am still grasping the economics. Capitalism (as I understood some theory) will tend toward returns at the cost of capital + the ""normal return rate"", but what has happened is that big companies with abnormally high profits eat up the smaller ones to maintain their oligopoly and abnormal profits, so prices do not tend toward production costs. Meanwhile automation and other technologies have decreased the cost of production, but not been passed to the consumer. This will only get worse as the capital becomes more concentrated into a few owners (the nominal price may not get higher, but the profit margin keeps increasing). Again I am not an expert there, but from an functional standpoint the system is failing to improve quality of life for people as much as it might potentially. My goal would be that the business create goods which may be exported to cover its costs, buy that the rest is essentially material for capital investment (in the literal sense of building materials).

If the business is designed as I outlined, then as we obtain more technological growth, a higher percentage of both physical material and labor may be incorporated without the need for importing (ie, using money to pay for it). Just as some people who do permaculture live entirely independently of the broader economy, a business might be able to do something similar. If it's goal is to reproduce itself using its own products, but the goods it does sell are cheap compared to existing companies, then it could be possible to replace antiquated industries with super-efficient production chains, benefiting people in general and leading to a higher quality of life for material goods at least.

Now all we need is a kick-starter campaign for a couple million dollars or a university investment for the experiment and some pro bono help from automation and other experts..."
"Graduation Project: questionaire research for my new blog about tech, automation, AI and philosophyHi,

I'm a student from Amsterdam, and at the moment I'm working on my bachelor graduation project. I'm setting up a new blog, where i'll focus on concepts like automation, technology, AI, science and innovation. The big question I'm focussing on is how automation can speed up progress, what the mechanisms are that drive this development and what are the philosophical implications. For instance, how can AI utilize robotic systems to automate certain processes, how can we fit 3D-printing in innovation processes - these kind of questions will be asked on my blog.   

It's required to do some research into the target audience. I choose a survey tool. This subreddit and it's people - you: automation fanatics, like me - are exactly whom I'll be targetting with my blog.

So my question is, would you all be so kind to help me out with me survey? It only takes a couple of minutes of your time, but to me it would mean the world. I included the survey link on the bottom of my post.

"Know how Financial service providers can transform their core operations using RPA Innovation 

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) on **November 30, 2018** under [**RPA**](http://blog.athenagt.com/category/rpa/)

&#x200B;

To  compete in an undeniably saturated financial industry,  where the  virtual operation adoption is increasing, financial companies need to  stay focused on their end goal. Expectations at customer end could be  hassle-free operations, accessibility, faster responsive, a value from  financial products/services, altogether a delighted client experience.  Expectations at firms end could be improved efficiency, a better  understanding of clientele, maintenance of privacy and security and low  costs.

[Robotic  Process Automation is the ultimate solution to exceed the expectations  at both customer and financial institutions' end. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd) 

Major banks such as Axis Bank and Deutsche Bank have implemented RPA  to automate certain business processes. RPA rapidly reduces costs, time  and staff required for various processes, in which tedious and  rule-based tasks are carried out by programmed “bots“, with reduced  human intervention. Hence, efficiency, accuracy and business operations  of the industry observe a substantial shift.

Financial service providers manage huge customer data and there is a  possibility of human error. By adopting RPA, they can lessen manual  processing and time consumption, maintain accuracy. Software bots have  the ability to perform rule-based logical tasks with human intelligence.  They can bring down the processing time up to 40% and costs up to 80%,  automating certain processes can help staff in engaging with higher  value tasks to shift the operational efficiency.

Let’s look into a few areas of financial institutes, where RPA can be implemented.

# Customer Service

Every financial services company  deals with numerous queries regarding products/services. RPA can be  implemented here, reducing the turnaround time and creating an improved  customer responsive system. Chatbots resolve the queries in real time,  using AI for decision making and NLP to process natural language. With  the help of NLP, Chabot can understand the natural language to  communicate with customer at ease, replacing staff.

# Compliance

Financial institutions, contributing to the economy, has to abide by  compliance. RPA has the ability to fetch and compose data from multiple  channels can improve the efficiency of the companies compliance program,  saving it from risks. It can also be available 24/7 and can streamline  processes like data collection, compilation sorting information and risk  reporting.

# Accounts Payable

Accounts payable is a simple yet repetitive process in banking. The  process involves producing customer information, validation, and process  payment. As this is a rule-based process, RPA can be implemented  undoubtedly in this case. RPA along with the help of optical character  recognition (OCR) facilitates the automation of the above process. OCR  reads the customer information from a scanned copy of the physical form  and feeds it to the RPA system. The system validates the data and  processes the payment. If an error occurs, It can notify the agent on  necessary actions.

# Credit cards and Loan Processing

The conventional credit card and loan application processing is a  time and labor intensive task. This task is tedious to the staff and  also displeasing to the customers, with RPA adoption, banks can swift  this process. RPA system can integrate and communicate with multiple  systems coherently, to fetch and validate the data and uses AI’s  decision making to either approve or reject the application.

# Fraud Detection

Along with the pros, the digital revolution has also brought some  cons and the notable one is FRAUD. Since financial institutions deal  with volume data, it’s hard for them to monitor all the customer  interactions to identify malicious activity. RPA comes to bank’s aid in  such scenarios, RPA deployed system has the ability to identify the  probable fraud transactions, recognizing the logical patterns in  real-time. It also can prevent fraud by notifying the executive/customer  on an unusual transaction.

# KYC Process

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a mandatory process for most of the  financial services companies. If manually done, it requires hundreds of  employees to validate the customer information. According to Thomson  Reuters, banks spend more than $384 million per year on KYC process  compliance. In order to minimize FTEs, reduce costs and to save an  adequate amount of time, the financial service providers are adopting  RPA to their business operations. RPA implementation in such process  minimizes human errors with 100% accuracy.

# General Ledger

To create accurate financial statements, the general ledger must be  updated with information such as revenue, assets, liabilities,  expenses.etc., this information needs to be gathered from different  legacy systems, that needs to be validated before publishing to a  general ledger.

Management of this huge data is prone to errors and inaccuracy.

RPA resolves this complexity, being powerful and technology  independent, it can be integrated with any system to collect data of  multiple formats. This also saves a lot of data handling time and  maintains accuracy.

# Report Automation

Creating an error-free and accurate report consumer a huge amount of  and time and number of employees. But still, doesn’t completely  eradicate the human error. RPA systems can collect data in multiple  formats, create reports by auto-filling the extracted data in the  required format and produce reports without errors at minimal cost and  time.

"Automation + population rise = an analog to the ""oncoming trains scenario."" Would mind-downloading be the ""switchman to switch the trains back to their separate tracks?""[This discussion entails an ominious scenario on the horizon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/5kxjww/the_robotic_grocery_store_of_the_future_is_here/dc23z6a/)

Automation may lead to fewer jobs for more people.

One train is automation, the other train is the rapidly-rising population. They're on the same track, traveling towards each other.

The crash would be countless people unable to find jobs, even when they're well-educated, because automation will have made too many jobs unnecessary and obsolete.

---

Now here's the ""switchman to prevent that collision:""

**Mind-downloading** would replace education - learn in just minutes what used to take years.

Everyone who undergoes a mind-download would learn to run their own business, practice and put forth a new groundbreaking idea, the Next Big Thing^(TM), and find any new way to make their own income no matter the level of automation by that time.

---

A UBI (Universal Basic Income) would be a basic safety net to help stave off some operating costs and other costs of propelling the next set of ideas and creativity forward, and perhaps not so much a way to live life (without contributing to society) off of it alone.

---

We will still have many other ways to contribute to society that automation can't:

Have you seen a robot invent something themselves? You know, 99% without our input? (1%: Powering them up, programming them to figure out what to invent and how to be self-reliant / self-sufficient.)

Have you seen automation author a new book? I don't just mean a technical manual; I mean something that would become a *bestseller*. Humans would need to want to read it; it would have to be as legendary as Harry Potter or better.

And even though I know [some robots can draw their own art now](https://www.google.com/search?q=drawn+by+artificial+intelligence&rlz=1C1NHXL_enUS699US699&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=974&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPmbL0tazRAhXKzVQKHfYJAwUQ_AUICSgC), will what they draw create a new subculture / fandom the likes of which would rival that of manga / anime? Manga / anime characters are pretty attractive; let's see A.I. draw something even more so.

The point I'm making is: We can still find something to contribute to the world (and beyond) that A.I. just can't ~~trump~~ supersede.

We will be better at finding that something, or making something new of that, once we increase our capacity for contributing to the world through mind-downloads.

---

Now, what are your notions on mind-downloading? Could sidestepping decades of education in minutes be the ticket to keeping neck-and-neck with A.I. and automation, thereby surviving well in this world?"
"Smart Tools and Economic Collapse Humans are the original ""smart tools"". We are able to copy ourselves and pass on our knowledge.  We built other tools using food-powered energy and raw materials from nature. Technologies like automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence are going into new types of smart tools - tools that don't need us any more to do their job. The new smart tools will also be able to copy themselves, pass on their knowledge, and make other tools using energy and raw materials from nature. The problem is our economic system is based on trading our labor for money, then trading that money for the other things we need and want.

 If the owners of the smart tools don't need people to run a business, they will get rid of them as an unnecessary expense. But the people who are unemployed will not be buying the products and services those businesses are selling, so those businesses lose income. They can't afford rent or mortgage payments, so landlords and lenders also lose income. Governments then also lose tax sources based on income, employment, sales, and property. If replacement of people by smart tools becomes widespread, everyone loses.  It leads to recession, depression, or economic collapse of our current system.

 Our tools are only going to get smarter and cheaper with time, but people have a limited ability to improve their skills or learn new ones. So eventually all conventional jobs are at risk from this problem. The question is when, and how do we deal with it?

----

  One answer is to leverage personal production networks and smart tools to solve the very problem they create.

 A personal production network is a distributed group of people.  They create useful products and services for themselves and people outside the network by building and operating their own equipment. They bootstrap from a starter set of skills, knowledge, tools, and resources. They help each other expand and upgrade from where they started. This includes adding new and improved skills; and more information, designs, and plans for their knowledge base. They buy more tools, equipment, and workspaces out of their earnings, or make their own using what they already have. Lastly, they accumulate funding, materials, energy, parts, and other resources to work with. Member goals include meeting most or all of their personal needs, be self-supporting, economically secure, and able to help new people by growing the existing network or starting new ones.

 A fully developed network would be able to make everything members want, including copying all their equipment and supplying new starter sets. A self-contained production chain, from raw materials to finished products, makes self-expansion and upgrade easier and less expensive. ""Smart tools"", which exploit automation, robotics, software, and artificial intelligence, can grow efficiently with little labor. A new network won't start out with all these abilities, but would grow into them a step at a time.  As owners of the smart tools, they are not at risk from labor displacement.  They still benefit from the tools, no matter how smart they get.

----
The ""Seed Factories"" subreddit has a link to a paper on ""Smart Tools and Self-Expanding Systems"" which goes into more depth on this subject.  It's a fairly long paper, so there is also a shorter slide presentation on ""Maker Networks"" (MakerNets)"" that covers the main points.

"Absolute Abundance— I wish to share with you a flash story about technostism (x-post /r/Technostism)That cool morning in the age of Orwell's Heaven, I ate breakfast, kissed my gynoid, and bought paper. Why not sit down at the table and dream new tales? Writing's easy and cathartic and my passion. And all year round, I would sit there, crafting wonders— making love to empty pages until midnight. Dawnlight starshine over pearl skies was my reward. I felt alive. Droids secured me a fine living. They would labor with the finest accuracy. Fabricators made everything for me freely with precision down to atoms at my leisure. Always high-end, they erased all class divisions. Droids served me well, decorating the finest sweets. They downloaded prior knowledge from their comrades. So they worked with infinite skills for maintenance. My house was cleaned, the roads repaired to perfection. Then when I said, ""Build me new rooms for my newborn,"" they went to work building my house like a mansion.

My gynoid worked as CEO of a business, making millions for me so vicariously. More droids were built to be sold off to networkers. Worker co-ops became technates across the globe. Networkers used and exploited these new age slaves to fix the world and to create fabricators. More built robots to do their work and support them. Droids fixed the parks. Droids fixed all roads. Droids cleaned junkyards— and the forests and the oceans effortlessly. Wealth spread around and there was no more poverty on Earth for good. Failed businesses were nothing more than slight bummers, for one could send droids into the massive workforce for their daily bread and help them try once again.

"The Analogy of Elements: Socialism vs. Technostism + Crushing the STEM FallacyX-post from /r/Technostism/

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^− . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because— *BECAUSE!*— it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class— not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*. Couple information (the Internet) with physicalization technology (3D printing, nanofabrication, nucleosynthesis, etc.) and you create an economy that pushes the limits of decentralization— every atom becomes a factory. Add to that a machine proletariat that lacks all shortcomings of a human one, and you get technostism. Anarchosyndicalism becomes feasible— nay, *desirable*. 

You ever hear ""socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor?"" That's essentially what this is, except all humans are rich.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before— ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws— any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before— somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words— it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy— robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs— but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor."
"List of jobs most in decline due to automationEvery March, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases a detailed table of employment by occupation for the previous May. They study May because it's not significantly affected by seasonal employment, and they release in March because, like with any survey, in order to get a representative sample of small subsets of the population, you have to survey a very large number of people. By March, the BLS will have run 10 surveys of 145,000 businesses each and will have asked about May each time. Still, a 35% rise in private chefs from 400 to 540 people could just be statistical noise, so I'll ignore the truly tiny occupations.

The 2013 table will come out this March, but I've used a database to cross-reference the [2010 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2010/may/oes_nat.htm) and [2012 table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/2012/may/oes_nat.htm) to try to find which jobs are losing the most workers, and to try to determine which declines may be due to automation.

Between 2010 and 2012, total US employment rose from 127 million to 130 million workers, or 2.51%. So anything not rising by 2.51% is falling behind.

Here are the occupations that stood out to me as likely affected by automation, by percentage of job loss from 2010 to 2012. This list primarily focuses on jobs affected by computerization and digitization rather than robotics. This is because jobs currently affected by robotics are largely in manufacturing, but since manufacturing is returning to America as robotics slashes manufacturing labor costs, American manufacturing employment is actually up even though the number of people required to manufacture, say, a set volume of textiles has [fallen by over 90 percent](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html) since 1980. There's a predictable theme of all manner of office administrators and bookkeepers being replaced by software, with many computer workers, people who thought they had learned the skills of the future, simply being replaced by computers outright. Remember that these changes are over just a two-year timespan.

    Cashiers                        -1.20%  -40,160

Feel free to ask about any of these occupations and how they're being automated. The biggest decline in sheer numbers is among executive secretaries and administrative assistants, down by 329,000 workers, a 29% fall, in just two years. In fact, this category has declined by 47% since 2007, as software is being used to automate these job functions away.

There's also a very large number of traditional trades that would overwhelm the list, but that no one is surprised are in decline, such as woodworkers and hand sewers. Many occupations in government, especially teachers, are in decline, as many governments have pursued an austerity strategy. The real estate and construction trades fell, since housing didn't really start rising again until 2013. Entertainment jobs are also down as entertainment goes digital and production goes international. Some jobs are simply evolving or being reclassified, such as computer programmers (-5.04%) becoming app developers (+17.44%), home health aides (-14.54%) becoming personal care aides (+43.61%), or telecom line installers (-14.91%) becoming cell tower installers (+64.55%), which was the second-fastest growing occupation on the list in percentage terms. Number 1 was models (+324.51%), but there are only 4,330 people classified as models, up from just 1,020, so statistical noise could be a factor. Another interesting shift is from chief executives (-6.42%) to general managers (+11.20%). General managers includes small business owners. Corporate consolidation could be a factor there.

The fastest growing umbrella categories of occupations by sheer numbers were food prep and serving (+519,540), sales (+397,110), and personal care (+385,530), with the great majority of the growth in the last category being from elderly care.

As /r/Automate has detailed, there are a lot of technologies ready to attack the food prep and serving category, from [tablet ordering at the table](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/03/tablets_at_restaurants_applebee_s_chili_s_race_to_eliminate_human_interaction.html) to [automated assembly-line kitchens](http://www.gizmag.com/hamburger-machine/25159/) to [vending machines that cook meals](http://www.letspizza.co.uk/) to 30-minute drone delivery to the home a la [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011).

As for elder care, many robots are in development to take care of the elderly, including robots that [monitor vital signs, detect falls, remind people to take medicine, find people who wander](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_o7bFbzMRM#t=27), [transport linens, serve refreshments, provide entertainment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx0zxr3D_zU), even [provide companionship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46sEGwiVO18). But given population trends, even if robots do address elder care, the sheer increase in demand from demographics could help protect workers in this field.

That leaves sales. The main growth here is in retail salespersons, which excludes cashiers, an occupation in decline. The BLS description of a retail salesperson is that they ""sell merchandise, such as furniture, motor vehicles, appliances, or apparel to consumers."" Furniture, cars and appliances are among the goods least conducive to online sales: They're expensive purchases that people want to examine in person before departing with large sums of cash, they're heavy products that are costly to ship, and the prospect of packing up and returning them if you're dissatisfied is daunting. But auto sales could decline as cheap or even [free self-driving taxis](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/google-patents-ad-powered-taxi-service-that-would-offer-free-rides-to-shoppers/) turn the car from a major purchase into an affordable service that arrives at your door. As for clothing, people want to try on clothes before they buy them. There are some businesses that try to work around this, whether by photographing you and creating a virtual fitting room or by sending you a large selection of clothes to try on and charging you only for what you don't return. But perhaps the most promising effort to automate clothing retail is a store that uses [hidden robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KSw28CnRhY) to replace a lot of the retail workforce. Most of the rest of the increase in the sales category is in a vague ""sales representatives, other"" category. My guess is that pharmaceutical reps, among other B2B reps, could hold a significant share of these jobs, but I simply don't know.

The three largest occupation umbrella categories in 2012, regardless of growth, are office and administrative support, sales, and food prep and serving. I've addressed those, but the fourth largest category is interesting: transportation and material moving. The 8.8 million workers in this category are likely in serious jeopardy from self-driving vehicles and robotic machinery that can handle freight.

You can parse the data yourself [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWPO6GB3DyjdFZuanFFNlJRSVhISkphRXNCUFNFTkE&usp=sharing#gid=0). You can download or copy the data to sort or otherwise manipulate it. And again, feel free to discuss and debate individual jobs and their vulnerability to automation.

**EDIT:** Removed several occupations after closer examination suggested they may be affected by reclassification."
"Know how Financial service providers can transform their core operations using RPA Innovation 

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) on **November 30, 2018** under [**RPA**](http://blog.athenagt.com/category/rpa/)

&#x200B;

To  compete in an undeniably saturated financial industry,  where the  virtual operation adoption is increasing, financial companies need to  stay focused on their end goal. Expectations at customer end could be  hassle-free operations, accessibility, faster responsive, a value from  financial products/services, altogether a delighted client experience.  Expectations at firms end could be improved efficiency, a better  understanding of clientele, maintenance of privacy and security and low  costs.

[Robotic  Process Automation is the ultimate solution to exceed the expectations  at both customer and financial institutions' end. ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/know-how-financial-service-providers-can-transform-their-core-operatives-using-rpa-innovation/&text=Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20is%20the%20ultimate%20solution%20to%20exceed%20the%20expectations%20at%20both%20customer%20and%20financial%20institutions%27%20end.&via=AthenagtLtd&related=AthenagtLtd) 

Major banks such as Axis Bank and Deutsche Bank have implemented RPA  to automate certain business processes. RPA rapidly reduces costs, time  and staff required for various processes, in which tedious and  rule-based tasks are carried out by programmed “bots“, with reduced  human intervention. Hence, efficiency, accuracy and business operations  of the industry observe a substantial shift.

Financial service providers manage huge customer data and there is a  possibility of human error. By adopting RPA, they can lessen manual  processing and time consumption, maintain accuracy. Software bots have  the ability to perform rule-based logical tasks with human intelligence.  They can bring down the processing time up to 40% and costs up to 80%,  automating certain processes can help staff in engaging with higher  value tasks to shift the operational efficiency.

Let’s look into a few areas of financial institutes, where RPA can be implemented.

# Customer Service

Every financial services company  deals with numerous queries regarding products/services. RPA can be  implemented here, reducing the turnaround time and creating an improved  customer responsive system. Chatbots resolve the queries in real time,  using AI for decision making and NLP to process natural language. With  the help of NLP, Chabot can understand the natural language to  communicate with customer at ease, replacing staff.

# Compliance

Financial institutions, contributing to the economy, has to abide by  compliance. RPA has the ability to fetch and compose data from multiple  channels can improve the efficiency of the companies compliance program,  saving it from risks. It can also be available 24/7 and can streamline  processes like data collection, compilation sorting information and risk  reporting.

# Accounts Payable

Accounts payable is a simple yet repetitive process in banking. The  process involves producing customer information, validation, and process  payment. As this is a rule-based process, RPA can be implemented  undoubtedly in this case. RPA along with the help of optical character  recognition (OCR) facilitates the automation of the above process. OCR  reads the customer information from a scanned copy of the physical form  and feeds it to the RPA system. The system validates the data and  processes the payment. If an error occurs, It can notify the agent on  necessary actions.

# Credit cards and Loan Processing

The conventional credit card and loan application processing is a  time and labor intensive task. This task is tedious to the staff and  also displeasing to the customers, with RPA adoption, banks can swift  this process. RPA system can integrate and communicate with multiple  systems coherently, to fetch and validate the data and uses AI’s  decision making to either approve or reject the application.

# Fraud Detection

Along with the pros, the digital revolution has also brought some  cons and the notable one is FRAUD. Since financial institutions deal  with volume data, it’s hard for them to monitor all the customer  interactions to identify malicious activity. RPA comes to bank’s aid in  such scenarios, RPA deployed system has the ability to identify the  probable fraud transactions, recognizing the logical patterns in  real-time. It also can prevent fraud by notifying the executive/customer  on an unusual transaction.

# KYC Process

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a mandatory process for most of the  financial services companies. If manually done, it requires hundreds of  employees to validate the customer information. According to Thomson  Reuters, banks spend more than $384 million per year on KYC process  compliance. In order to minimize FTEs, reduce costs and to save an  adequate amount of time, the financial service providers are adopting  RPA to their business operations. RPA implementation in such process  minimizes human errors with 100% accuracy.

# General Ledger

To create accurate financial statements, the general ledger must be  updated with information such as revenue, assets, liabilities,  expenses.etc., this information needs to be gathered from different  legacy systems, that needs to be validated before publishing to a  general ledger.

Management of this huge data is prone to errors and inaccuracy.

RPA resolves this complexity, being powerful and technology  independent, it can be integrated with any system to collect data of  multiple formats. This also saves a lot of data handling time and  maintains accuracy.

# Report Automation

Creating an error-free and accurate report consumer a huge amount of  and time and number of employees. But still, doesn’t completely  eradicate the human error. RPA systems can collect data in multiple  formats, create reports by auto-filling the extracted data in the  required format and produce reports without errors at minimal cost and  time.

"Assuming 'worst case' automation scenarios, how will humans find meaning in productivity? In the 20th century, automation has been successful mostly in eliminating factory line work. This is menial labor that is hard to enjoy or take pride in (I assume).

 But in the 21st century, we're seriously looking at the possibility that work reliant on the human mind will also become obsolete. An example where machines have finally come to thoroughly dominate humans is chess (and example I choose in lieu of actual knowledge work because the objection can be made that a lot of it is dull, routine and just as worthy of elimination as menial labor. Chess is something people do voluntarily.).If chess were a business, there would be no humans in it today because anyone can easily obtain a chess engine that is better than any human in the world. People keep playing human vs human games with the aid of computers (outside of the timed match) but I can't imagine that it feels very good to be extremely talented at something that a computer can do better. 

It may seem to be a far stretch from chess to real world tasks, but the jump from chess to Go also seemed enormous. As recently as early last year, many thought that an AI wouldn't come even close to beating an expert Go player for a long time. Yet here we are. There is work on AI art, AI diagnostic systems, AI induction (like independently postulating Newton's Laws from data), AI design, AI traders, AI CEOs and I imagine many others I either cannot recall at the moment or am unaware of. Surely, not every one of these efforts will succeed within my lifetime but it's possible that a lot of them will bear fruit. Certainly, if you believe claims such as those made by Elon Musk about an AI capable of threatening humanity, then a lot of the aforementioned projects should be no less plausible. 

We can tolerate our physical limitations because we are unique in our mental abilities among animals and robots. But if AI can 'reason' better than we can, if AI can compose better poems than most poets, if AI can make a decade of training obsolete, what will be left other than hedonism? What will be worth striving for? What will we spend thousands of hours perfecting?"

"10 Advantages Of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)At [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/), we provide solutions that integrate [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), with business intelligence software and AI technology to improve various logistics scenarios and enable efficient and flexible operations. With a large portfolio of successful cases, we've listed some of the advantages of [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products).

**1. Tripling the productivity of order fulfillment**

When there are multiple orders received, the [MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' system will carry out multi-order picking. It controls the picking robot to carry a corresponded rack with multiple SKUs to the workstation for order picking by workers. Hence, a single pick can fulfill multiple orders. Workers do not have to spend time walking, looking for ordered items, on a specific shelf in scattered locations of the warehouse. Therefore, workers can focus on order picking only. This helps to increase the picking productivity by 300% when compared to the manual operation.

**2. Lower Labor Costs**

[MIWA Robotics](https://www.miwarobotics.com/)' AMR system also enables the optimization of labor. With this system, workers can spend all the working hours focusing on order picking only. When order picking becomes more efficient, it means fewer workers can achieve the same or much higher picking productivity than manual operation. This helps reducing labor costs. 

**3. No Single Point of Failure**

By implementing [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), warehouses can ensure continued operations and mitigate against issues associated with single-point-of-failure, which are common in operations relying on fixed infrastructure e.g operation may shut down when the conveyor belt is broken. If an AMR breaks down, it can be easily fixed and replaced without affecting the operation.

**4. Flexible to Scale Up and Down**

The number of robots as well as hours of work per day can be easily adjusted to meet changes in demand even if there is an unexpected peak or off-peak season. Businesses can now avoid the difficulties associated with finding labor under various peak scenarios and the time associated with hiring and then training new staff. Through real-time monitoring and inventory control, the scheduling of [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can dynamically adjusted following incoming demands. 

It also enables businesses to expand their scale in different stages. For example, deploying automation in one part of the warehouse and automating other parts later by adding more robots for the increasing demand in the future.   


https://preview.redd.it/jv7umeor26k91.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4316073e06ea7a770dc320a914c108f583c4a882

**5. Fast deployment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be flexibly implemented without the costs associated with fixed infrastructure. The mobility, autonomy, and size make them easy to implement into the existing warehouse. The infrastructures are required only as simple as five components: robots, workstation, WiFi, Shelf & QR code. Therefore, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)can be easily installed and can go-live within 1-3 months.

**6. Higher Storage Capacity**

The total number of storage bin locations will increase. As the storage bin locations are customized for specific SKUs, therefore, each bin location can be fully utilized to store the same items. This ensures there is no space being wasted.

**7. More Accurate Operations** 

Errors can have several explanations, however, avoiding them is becoming increasingly important as people have higher demands for faster and accurate services. By deploying [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products), you can avoid errors associated with manual operations like stress brought on during peak, new staff, and increasingly difficult logistics scenarios like reverse logistics.

**8. Safer Operations** 

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are designed to work dynamically with their surroundings and are highly responsive. By using built-in sensors, laser scanner, and intelligent algorithms, it can detect workers or obstacles and then adjust the route. This allows for a safe and collaborative environment of AMRs and warehouse workers.

**9. Improve the working environment**

[AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)deployment is not simply replacing human works. Workers are still the most essential element in the operation. They are going to equip more skills to control the system and collaborate with the [AMRs](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products). Therefore, deploying [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)is creating an ergonomic working process for workers and increasing their value to the business. 

**10. Flexible Relocation**

Imagine your warehouse needs to relocate due to costs or changes in business, in that case, moving the warehouse infrastructure can be a struggle and large additional cost may be involved in uninstalling. Unlike fixed infrastructure, [AMRs ](https://www.miwarobotics.com/products)are easy to relocate and can enable a quick transition period.

"How close or far are we from getting robots that can viably replace musical instrumentalists?This is a different question from robots replacing all musicians, which encompasses instrumentalists, arrangers, and composers.

Outside of some genres such as jazz that rely on heavy improvisation, many musicians are playing pieces that have already been written. Even jazz usually sticks with a chord progression, and its improvisation has [potential to be computer generated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VTI1BBLydE). No matter how skilled a player may be, it seems to me that robots will have much greater potential, with many more ""fingers"", much greater ""lung"" capacity, and no errors. As such, I think that it would be possible in the future to replace instrumentalists with them, and music jobs will be narrowed down to those who require much more creativity that can't be programmed too easily, such as creating new styles and genres. I imagine that there are already a good number of composers who can create great pieces but can't play any instrument at all, but this would become even more a thing in the future.

Technologies for [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xlm8LFImno) and [saxophone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjONQNUU8Fg) already seem to be getting there, whereas [violin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ_NF4J5W6s) is still in the beginning stages.

Live music may retain its instrumentalists because it seems to be a socio-cultural phenomenon that's more than just the music itself. It's also just cool to see novelty acts such as trying to beat the world record for guitar shredding speed. However, I magine that their industrial viability may be reduced.

How far are we from having robots that can replace human studio musicians to play, from simple backing tracks to complex classical or metal music? What is the view of the music industry on this?"
"Automating with RPA vs BPACurious to know the specific reasons why a standard business looking to automate routine admin would opt for RPA over BPA? (When it will usually cost a magnitude more?) 

It's the hot new tech and all, but RPA [isn’t offering anything radically new](https://www.thinkautomation.com/automation-advice/how-does-rpa-work-same-stuff-different-way/) in terms of the kinds of processes it automates. Businesses are generally using it to handle the same  repetitive processes that traditional BPA has been handling for many years now. 

Granted, working on the interface level rather than relying on integrations is a lot slicker. But it's no quicker to set-up than traditional BPA (training bots vs writing 'if' rules). And, practically speaking, those trained “robots” are still just running rule-based actions. 

Has anyone conducted a cost analysis of RPA vs BPA, considering the specific processes they need to automate? If so, what were your outcomes?"

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found value in it!

"Making a robot automaticI won't write too much info but essentially I'm making a portable irrigation robot which would just go around the garden and water the grass and plants...now controlling it using a rf controller would be quite simple but my aim is to calibrate it to map out my garden and just follow the same path everyday and quite honestly I haven't found anything useful online...any help down in the comments would be appreciated

P.S I'm just in high school and this is a high school project so my knowledge regarding these systems isn't quite enormous"
"What happens when robots take over?I was having a discussion earlier and came to the conclusion automation in every field of work is inventible, causing mass unemployment. Now I can see a wonderful utopia for the world if we achieved this point simultaneously but lets be honest that won't happen. So there will be a period of time where employment is rampart. My question is really even when there are no longer any jobs left for humans, what happens to us? Does social class disappear? Do we all become equal as no one really could earn more than anyone else. Also any further reading on this wound be much appreciated."
