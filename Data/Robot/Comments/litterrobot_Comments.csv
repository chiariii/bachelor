Just a side note, the gear boxes gears and shafts they rotate on are just barely skim coated with a dampening grease out of the factory, this is done intentionally so there is little to no drag on the motor cause by the lubrication. The down side is, (depending on how much its used?) it will run dry of lubrication fairly fast causing the gears to chatter on the shafts they rotate on, this WILL cause over torque faults!\n\nThe drive motor its self is starting to fail, the tell tail sign of this happening is the globe will overshoot its position when leveling the litter in the globe causing the litter to be higher on the right side and lower on the left. This happens because the motor is rotating faster than intended due to a winding on the armature shorting, the trade off is the motors rotational torque is lessened. hence the over torque error. Eventually the motor will let out the magic smoke and fail!\n\nOut of all of these the most common I've seen is the gear box is running dry on lube.

Then use the solder pencil tip to lay on the individual solder pads touching the end of the pins, this will reflow the remaining solder to the individual pin. This way you are avoiding gapping pins.

It\'s freaking adorable.  He\'s always been a bit of a funny and spunky cat, but sometimes noises scare him and he can be skittish.  He seems to think this thing is the ""cats\' meow,"" no pun intended!', ""I have two cats and I've been using top entry boxes for many years because one of my previous cats was a huge digger. She was an indoor/outdoor cat early on and always went outside so she would go at the litter like she was trying to dig her way to China. She passed away a few years ago but I kept using them because that's what my cats were used to.\n\nI got the LR4 a few days ago and my younger cat took to it right away. The old box is sitting right next to it and she always uses the Litter Robot so I assume she loves it. My senior male isn't afraid of it but still uses the old box. I'm hoping he will switch over soon but even with only one cat using it the box scooping chore is greatly reduced.""]"

If a cat attempts to enter the unit during a cycle, the Globe will stop with the Light Bar displaying red, indicating the cycle has been interrupted. The cycle will not resume until 15 seconds after the cat is no longer detected.\n\nThe Litter-Robot is also equipped with a Motion Sensor that monitors the Waste Drawer. If motion is detected within the Waste Drawer when the Globe is at the Home position, the unit will rotate the Globe to a position such that the Waste Port provides egress from the Waste Drawer. \n\nTo clarify, if that sensor (or any of them) has dust or hair, it can detect it as ""motion,"" causing a fault or pause. The above sensor is sometimes overlooked or unseen, so we like to include the image for clarity.\n\nWe hope this helps!']"

"[""I make sure I vacuum under the bonnet before I leave and wipe the top of the base down and the connectors as well.  I've found litter piles up under the bonnet sometimes, and that causes it to have issues.  I try to vacuum it every other time I change the bag (for me that's about once a week or less with 3 cats).  I, too, have a cat sitter familiar with LR.  I just tell her to change the bag every 2 days and that keeps it from ever getting full or stopping - by watching the trends I know that every 2 days minimum it's full, or maximum 4 days.  So I default to changing every 2.  She also pulls out the bin and shakes it once a day to make sure it's not reading full when it's actually just a poop iceberg sticking up.\n\nI honestly have never disassembled it beyond taking off the bonnet to vacuum and wipe a bit.  I have never had any major issues.  I don't have litter that's very dusty, so there is not much to clean on it and I've heard that a lot of people break down whole LR and have issues after it after.

"['I have the LR4 and overall am happy with it. I don’t have to think much about litter boxes anymore. With 3 cats, I empty the LR4 about once every 4 or 5 days. An unexpected perk is that my litter lasts way longer and I go through much less than before. \n\nAs outlined in an earlier post of mine, I think the software is buggy at times and has room for improvement. They’re slowly rolling out updates and improvements and even with the bugs, I’d definitely buy again. \n\nWith that said, some important notes:\n\n1. Absolutely buy the extended warranty for peace of mind. \n2. If leaving the house for an extended period of time (for me that threshold is overnight), setup a back-up litter box just in case of a malfunction. \n3. Know that when you plug in the LR4 for the first time, it immediately starts cycling! They should make this abundantly clear on the packaging but they do not. Many people aren’t aware of this and their cats get scared and then don’t touch the robot for days. Instead, I recommend to keep it completely unplugged around your cat for a few days while your cat gets used to being around it.', ""Long AF reply lol\n\nI'm a huge fan (LR4) and swear by it at this point. That being said, when we first received it we had problems. It was the firmware and we ended up just waiting for the right release. My husband was mad and wanting to return it, but I was opposed and because I normally deal with that part of kitty-care, I won 😆. The fix happened a couple of months after we received it, and beyond very minor and easily fixed cleaning/dusting the cameras, there was very little we had to struggle with. \n\nMost errors can be cleared to continue its cycle with no issue. I haven't had to in quite some time.\n\n The bin below where you put in the bag to catch the mess used to infuriate me after reading it was already 30% full after totally changing it. I learned that when you put the bag in, you want to try to press it down in the empty space as smoothly as possible so that there aren't any air pockets inflating for the sensors to mistake as solid masses. Very silly tech to be fooled imho 😆 it still tells me that it's already anywhere from 5-10%, but I'm cool with that. Once the robot thinks it's full, it tends to refuse to continue. This can end up leaving the space open where the waste falls, because it thinks that waste may be stopping it from cleanly working. \n\nSpeaking of the waste bin and how to install the bag, the kind of bag does matter. You will at the very least, be encouraged to double-bag grocery bags. I greatly prefer the bags you can order from Whisker. They'll send you a sample. They're much thicker and much longer plastic. Part of why I like them is because of how easy it makes it to utilize a kind of reverse cycle to pour the litter into the waste, when you may want to completely clean inside or change the litter. Honestly, I need to add litter maybe once a week and similarly need to take out the bag of mess along that same weekly pattern.\n\nWhisker is what we use to deliver their litter, bags, filters, etc. Whisker offers a couple of different odor control items. One is a filter and the other is an 'odor pack' of scented gel beads. I started with the filter and tried the odor packs once before completely preferring the first option. It's not that the beads were bad necessarily, but they can't be put in with the filter and I didn't recognize a tremendous improvement. The filter works very well and in either instance couldn't detect odors at all.\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on it via the Whisker app. It connects to your robot, offers to nickname the machine (turd burglar), offers to send you notifications every time your kitty goes potty, to let you know of any errors immediately. For example, if your kitty is curious and pokes their cute little nose inside to figure out wtf the machine is doing, the machine stops immediately and goes in to a waiting timer to ensure the cat isnt there before it starts again. You can clear it faster by pushing a button if needed. Kitty gets a weight record (lol I used to weigh myself and then grab my tubster cat before doing bad math 😆). You want to make sure to install the litter guard and set out a good litter mat, as some kitties can be a little messy getting out after they finish.\n\nTLDR? It's an amazing machine that took a couple months to get totally working. No issues since. Whisker is highly recommended for their litter bags and filters. The wipes aren't bad either, but not really too necessary. Just easier to subscribe and get everything there. The app for Whisker is incredibly useful."", 'The LR3 was life changing - we have 4 cats and 3 bots.  We started with 1 in summer of 2019 and then ordered 2 more a month or so later once we discovered it works and the cats would use it.  The LR3 bots were fine but we upgraded to the LR4’s when they were released.   The LR4 is a game changer because of the increased litter bin capacity.  Of the 3 bots, 2 are used more heavily and we were changing every other day with the LR3 and now change every 4th day with the LR4.  \n\nWe use Dr Elsey’s Cat Attract litter (amazon subscribe and save), we use generic plastic garbage bags (also amazon subscribe and save), and then the scent packs (on auto delivery from Whisker).  We also have all the bots on smart plugs so we can power cycle remotely and have cameras on all the bots.\n\nIn terms of errors, we had a recent issue with a pinch fault but we fixed that easily with some cleaning.  The more common error we get is repeated triggers of the cat sensors: happens every few months. If this happens while we are on vacation, a power cycle will fix it.  If were are home, we clean the sensors.  We do have the extended warranty.\n\nIn terms of our cats, when we first got the LR3s, we had 4 cats ranging in size from 12 lbs to 18 pounds and ages ranged between 9 and 13.  One of those cats had diabetes and having a camera on the LR3 was instrumental in monitoring his litter box habits; I wish we had the LR4 when he was alive so we could better watch his weight trends. All 4 of those cats started using the LR3 within a few days without issue.  When we upgraded to the LR4s, no one had an issue changing from the LR3 to the LR4.  Over the last 2 years, 2 of our cats have died and we have adopted 2 younger cats.  We adopted each younger cat at different times: 1 was 6 months and the other was about a year old.  Both of them learned to use the bots without any issues and within about a week of coming home.  \n\nIn short, the LRs have been game changers for us and we absolutely intend to buy new versions as they come out.', ""I think you have gotten plenty of advice from others, I just wanted to say 2 things.\n\n 1, as you said you do the cleaning, so really it's your call. If your husband is so against it tell him he needs to start doing the litterbox duties for a month. Depending on how many cats you have it will be a week or two before he sees your viewpoint. My husband and I have had one LR3 for our 3 cats, one of which was diabetic and had pancreatitis so he was peeing A LOT. I had to daily shake the drawer to even it out and change the bag every other day. We are trying for a family and one day I just decided that it was his sole responsibility in preparation for me not being able to handle it. Within a week he was telling me we needed a second unit.\n\n2, yes it has problems, just like with everything. And as many people say you would expect something so expensive to be built better, which I agree with. But I have zero regrets with our purchase decision. Even when our LR got stuck upside down while we were out of town and we had to have our friend come by after his shift at 4:30am on Christmas day. I still am happy with my purchase. Though I would definitely always keep a backup around in case of emergencies and for when you travel."", 'I have the LR4 and honestly…I love it. I loathed scooping the litter box prior and now I feel like I’m harding maintaining it at all. It’s not any more difficult to clean in my opinion & it comes apart fairly easy. The ONLY issue we had was a motor fault about 6-9 months after getting it - and to be fair it wasn’t LR’s fault. We bought it as soon as it released. It automatically comes with a 1 year warranty and LR sent us a new base immediately. It literally came in less than a week & in that weeks time, I was brought back to having to deal with litter without it and it only reassured me this was a good purchase. They have an additional warranty for $100 which is totally worth it in my opinion after the included warranty time is up - just in case. \nOtherwise, I know now what caused the motor fault - one of my cats (I have 3 cats using 1 LR) ripped the lining when scratching which was incredibly minor and unnoticeable and probably wouldn’t have caused an issue at all if we wouldn’t have used Pretty Litter one time. Pretty Litter is non-clumping and caused the leakage to go through the liner. So, definitely don’t advise using it in your robot. Also, LR sent us a new liner also with no questions asked.\nAt the end, best purchase ever. I will never go back.\nAll that to say: if you take care of it, it will take care of you.', ""I honestly really love my litter robot. I was a little nervous, reading the reviews myself.

I haven't deep cleaned it yet, so I don't know how hard it is to take apart or put back together. But I'm sure it isn't that hard. I clean the inside sometimes, when I feel it needs a quick little wipe down. \n\nSometimes I have to hit the reset button because the sensors get dirty, so if you end up getting it, make sure you wipe down the sensors every one in awhile. \n\nThe downside of it that I have noticed so far is the light. And that is because the litter robot is in my room, and so it's annoying to sleep with. But other than that, I really love it!

We love our LR4. \nGood luck', 'I got the LR4 earlier this year after waffling back and forth because of the bad reviews. At first I was only kind of satisfied with it. Not scooping was great, but I still felt like I needed to change the bag every day or so because of odor. I tried a few different litters, but nothing seemed to help. After hearing multiple people on Reddit recommend Boxiecat litter I figured I’d give that a go. GAME CHANGER. I change the bag every 3-4 days (3 cats) and there is essentially no smell, and it clumps great. I have recommended the LR4 and Boxiecat to every cat owner I know.', 'So I wanted to get LR sooner but my husband said the same thing.

Our robot vacuums have required way more maintenance than LR4s (we have two)\n\nBig thing: have a back up if you are away for extended periods of time!

My two cats took to it immediately and it’s so easy to maintain. I’ve only had a few minor issues over time, and all of them have stemmed from me slightly over filling the litter area.

I am now using my third LR4 (second replacement). I vented pretty hard against Whisker in that post.\n\nHere’s the experience that you should expect—the LR4 is almost guaranteed to work out of the box, and it will be amazing once your cats are acclimated. You will go an entire week, or more, without worrying about your cats’ bathroom activities, and after a whole week or more you only need to empty the drawer. Takes 5 minutes. It’s great when paired with an automatic feeder and water fountain. Your feline friends basically become roommates.\n\nBut, owning a LR4 comes at the risk of it suddenly not working, getting stuck mid-cycle, and that situation can actually be *worse* than just scooping cat litter from an ol’ fashioned litter box because your cats won’t have anywhere to do their business (assuming there is no backup).\n\nWhisker seems to be pretty good at replacing faulty robots. If you or your spouse does not work full time, and is usually at home for most of the day, then it will surely be worth the cost—the stay-at-home person can just keep an eye on it when it starts to show signs of malfunctioning. Otherwise, I think it is still likely to be worth the cost given the assumption that your unit functions properly for a long time, or that you do not tolerate malfunctions and you get yours replaced right away when it becomes necessary.', 'I have a LR3 - not a connect one. \nI’ve had it for almost four years with two cats. \n\nHere’s how it’s honestly been going. \n\nIn terms of a daily use, it’s an absolute life saver.

Once I did that it started working flawlessly again', ""I'm a bit late in replying, but I've been a litter robot fan girl since \\~2006ish when I got my original LR2 for my 3 cats (17lbs, 18lbs & my teensy 5lb girl), and it's is still running like a champ. I decided an upgrade was in order in 2019, and ordered the LR3, which has been a bit buggy & problematic from the start, but I still got a 2nd LR3, which is also problematic. It seems there's a fairly well known issue with the DFI & pinch connector board corroding due to the moisture/humidity it's exposed to & causes the robots to fail to cycle. From what I understand, Whiskers upgraded/updated the DFI board with an enclosure that's supposed to take care of the issue. I'm waiting for the updated DFI board to arrive & am hopeful that will put both of my LR3s back in service again. I think Whiskers went through some growing pains around the time the LR3 was released, and I hope these issues are just a fluke - would be thrilled to see my LR3s in the same light as the LR2!\n\nDespite my issues with the LR3s, I'm still a fan. I've been reminded over the  last few weeks just how much more kitty litter the LR saved - I have no idea how, the cats use the LR with the same frequency as a regular box, but with the LR & 1 cat it took 5-6 months to go through 42lbs of litter. I've gone through more than 40lbs of litter in the last month since the LR3s stopped working... Granted, I added a kitten to the family 3 weeks ago, but still. The difference is astonishing. As others have said, the LR pays for itself in litter costs alone in fairly short order, especially in multi-cat households. Plus, never having to scoop is phenomenal! Just grab the bag, tie it, replace & done. Easy. It only takes a minute to do & doesn't need to be done daily. \n\nTLDR; When it works it's fantastic. When it doesn't, it's frustrating, but can be repaired with a little time, googling and redditing (and/or warranty service).

So either you do have a breech in the liner or the globe is letting in urine from a different location.

The SY is basically a combo of the 2 Garfield grains, which results in tighter clumps.  That said, I didn't see any noticeable difference in the quality of clumps.  However, the larger grains supposedly track less which is why SY came out with large grain formula, but both grain sizes are very small and fine.""]"
"['After doing several teardown and rebuilds to deep clean and one actual weight sensor replacement I figured out how they are calibrated!\n\nFirst off when dealing with a pressure sensitive variable resistor you need to have a clean surface for it to adhere to, this means  when the adhesive is used to maintain position of the sensor there MUST NOT be any debris causing an uneven surface to apply pressure on.\n\nAfter that is established assemble the weight foot and pressure plate with the little rubber baby buggy bumper against the weight sensor, fasten the nut on the weight foot bolt. While applying pressure to the pressure plate bottoming out the weight spring fasten the nut all the way till the nut bottoms out on the threads, then loosen 3 whole turns and gently let up on the spring tension. This will get you ""roughed"" in.\n\nNow for the actual physical calibration of the sensor, try not to apply artificial weight to the base unit or just separate the bottom half of the LR and have it on your work space with nothing else attached. Next you will need to connect your VOM to the sensor leads. The goal is to achieve the lowest ohm reading possible. You should see a minimum reading anywhere between or around the range of 400 to 600 OHMs as each sensor will read different for its lowest OHM reading. Next loosen the nut a half turn and observe the ohm reading, depending on the direction of the ohm reading either tighten or loosen as needed. The goal is to achieve the lowest reading you can get each time you turn the nut press lightly on the base to engage the spring and release to let it resettle, you will notice a slight change in the reading, adjust accordingly to get the lowest reading possible. Once you have the lowest reading you can get, and with no weight present then tighten the nut one full turn, what this will do is slightly desensitize the sensor so it does not trigger a cat intrusion on cycle due to the vibrations of the globe / changes in litter position etc. If the sensor is TOO sensitive this WILL happen. Once you have finished reassembling everything, next is to ""soft recalibrate"" the control board so it has a NEW baseline to function off of.\n\nAt this point reassemble completely the LR, power up the unit and let it do it\'s self checks and globe cycle, let it get to the ready state, (solid blue light).\n\nTo soft calibrate, make certain you have an EMPTY waste drawer and globe,  but if you don\'t want to empty the globe, I found you can just remove the globe and put the bonnet back on and this works just as well.\n\nNext, with the blue ready light illuminated solid, and without touching anything on the base with the exception of the control buttons press and HOLD the EMPTY and RESET buttons, (usually 5 to 6 seconds) till you see the RED light flash fast, then let go and the red flashing light should stop and the blue ready light should illuminate solid once again. If the blue light doesn\'t illuminate just press the reset button and it will.\n\nReinstall the globe if you had it removed, power cycle the LR once again and then test the weight sensitivity of the LR, it should be back to the expected proper function.\n\nYou can also at this point if the sensor is still too sensitive or isn\'t sensitive enough readjust the nut a turn or so either way but I found this rarely is needed.\n\nFor reference the weight sensor when installed and read the lowest you can calibrate it to, (400 to 600 ohms is healthy) anything higher is drifting out of spec. When the sensor is set to it lowest ohm value, loosening can, (but rarely does, unless its slightly out of spec) make it slightly sensitive and tightening desensitizes it.\n\nWhen pressure is being applied the clamping force on the sensor is lessening, the ohms will rise up around 1.5 to 1.7 K ohms before going out of limits to an open state.\n\nHope this helps you out?!', ""This is extremely helpful, thank you! The main thing is probably the reset procedure, I'm using sensors from Digikey at the moment and they should work fine (and did for a minute) but as I detailed the thing started acting up again which just frustrated the living daylights out of me b/c I'm so tired of taking it apart with the blinking!  \n\n\nLike I'm not even exaggerating here, the LR2 units I have are possibly as much as 10 years old and STILL WORKING GREAT without ever needing a new power supply or a motor or switch or anything. The only reason I started getting the 3 units was b/c fat cats. I have NINE of the LR3 units, and keeping them from just randomly blinking all the time is a daily chore. That's NOT the point of having robots helping us by dealing with the cat crap.

The gearbox lubrication issue as well? I've managed to work around those issues with simple fixes that allow them to keep on running with little to no constant upkeep aside from the occasional deep clean rebuild, emptying of the drawer/ litter refill etc.... We have a small rescue as well and one of the 3 LR3's sees over 1300 cycles per month and keeps on trucking with virtually no issues!.\n\nI'm still using the older DFI that famous for moisture intrusion on the I/O chip on the Emitter board, I just clean, re-solder them and apply a new clear coat to them and all is good once again. Use a dielectric grease the encase the contact points on the pinch detect contacts, keep the gearbox lubed with a general purpose light grease. and once a week do a quick wipe of the bonnet and base electrical connections that take less than 20 seconds to do. and occasionally when I see the need, I recalibrate the weight sensors.\n\nTrying to get the R&D department to improve the product will be next to impossible when the bean counters in the accounting department are constantly forcing them to design something on the ultra cheap, the bean counters always win when it comes to the bottom line...""]"

Rotate the nut counter clockwise, (loosen) 1 full turn.\n\nNext take your bonnet and globe off the base unit, place the bonnet back on only, empty and place the waste drawer back in.\n\nWith your LR in the ready state (blue light) and without touching the LR with the exception of the control panel buttons press and hold BOTH the EMPTY and RESET buttons till you see the red light flash fast (usually about 5 seconds), once you see the fast flashing red light let go of the buttons and the light should return to a blue light only, if it doesn't just press reset and it will.\n\nRemove the bonnet and place the globe and bonnet back on, power cycle the LR, (unplug the power from the back of the base unit and back in) let it cycle and when ready then see if kitty triggers the cat timer?\n\nIf it still does not trigger you will need a replacement weight sensor.

"[""If you have a slow flashing yellow light (on and off once a second) either on power up or when in the process of cycling, This is an indication of the bonnet not making a proper connection or there's an internal fault with the bonnet electronics. Judging by your description the LR3 has not cycled at all out of the box, so lets go with that symptom and troubleshoot.\n\nHere's a few simple thing you can do to quickly narrow down the issue;\n\nStep #1. Is the blue night light on when the LR is powered up?, (you should see 3 blue lights), If you are in a well lit area place your finger over the little circle at the 8 o clock position of the POWER button on the base unit. If there still is no illumination skip to step #3\n\nStep #2.  You see 3 blue lights, try turning the night light feature off (press and hold the POWER button for 5 seconds). Power cycle the unit, does the globe now rotate?\n\nStep #3. You don't see any blue lights, And you have already checked the electrical connection at the left rear of the bonnet and base to be clean and touching, If so?, go to step #4\n\nStep #4. Take the bonnet off only, on the base you will see the 2 metal contact points the bonnet make an electrical connection to. Find anything that is bare metal that will be able to connect BOTH the metal contact on the base together to make an electrical connection, make certain it remains connected for the test, (this will simulate the bonnet connection and will get the LR3 past the self checks on startup if nothing is wrong with the base unit.) Does the globe start moving? If yes?, go to step #5, if no?,  go to step #6.\n\nStep #5. the globe moves with the metal contacts shorted together, you either have a defective bonnet, or the polarity is reversed on the base contacts. go to step #7\n\nStep #6. If you have no change in operation with or without the base's bonnet contacts being shorted together as described in step #4,  there could be a physical wiring issue. go to step #7.\n\nStep #7.  pull the globe and waste drawer off and out of the base unit.  With a flashlight in hand you will see a small cavity on the left side of the base units waste drawer opening, look in an upward in the cavity, you should see a twisted Black and Purple wire going to the contacts on the top of the base unit, these are the wires that feed the power (+5 volts DC) to the bonnet. (SEE PIC BELOW!) Do any of the 2 wires look like they are loose and not connected to anything?. If NO, is the BLACK wire closer to you than the PURPLE wire? (You should see the black wire closest to you and the purple wire towards the rear of the base unit). If it appears connected there's either a wiring issue or the control board is malfunctioning and you will need to warranty the unit. If any of the 2 wires are disconnected or in reverse order this is your issue. GO to step #8\n\nStep #8.  If its a wiring issue you can with a #2 Philips screwdriver with at least a 6 inch long shank, unfasten the 9 screws on the bottom of the base unit and gain access to the connectors to correct.

"[""1. There is space for them to put their paws on the lip of the globe if you don't use the included fence, but I think most here would recommend grabbing one of the PetSafe stairs on Amazon. These fit nicely over the LR4 step and give plenty of extra space to perch on if that's your kitties' preference.\n\n2. One of mine has regular poo problems and just got over a spat. Not to be totally nasty, but he had poos the consistency of soft serve, roughly. The LR4 with Dr Elsey's Ultra handled them okay, but saying it was mess free would be a lie. There would be streaks on the grate and leading into the poop chute. They cleaned up easy enough and I just kept wiping it down regularly with cleaner and a paper towel so that it didn't get outright nasty. The poo would also break up at times and get clumps stuck to and in the grate as well as on the side of the liner because Gandalf is a jerk and does his business down the side instead of in the litter bed. If yours do this, keep a manual scoop around and use it to scrape any mess into the litter bed. This will get filtered out next cycle and can help keep things clean enough to avoid too frequent deep cleans.\n\n3. I originally used a single LR4 for 5 cats. I had to empty it daily, but it mostly worked. The wrinkle was our senior cat who had kidney disease and wouldn't wait. I added a manual box as backup for him if the LR4 was cycling when he had to go. He recently passed away so I'm letting the manual box get dirty in preparation to take it away. All of the cats use the LR4, but our chonky boi definitely prefers the manual box so I'm giving him some transition time. I now empty the LR4 every 3 days or so. I expect I'll be back to every other day when all 4 are using just the LR4. The remaining 4 did not have any problems when I wasn't using the spare box. If it was cycling they'd just wait for it to finish so I'm hoping it'll be an easy transition.\n\n4. The general rule is to mix litters, gradually adding more of the new and less old, to help your cats transition. In reality, it probably depends on the cats. I tried crystal litter with mine for a while as I was hoping for less dust and less tracking. I didn't mix at all. Just swapped them from clay one day and all of the 6-at-the-time cats kept peeing where they were meant to no prob. This was when I had solely manual boxes. If you're worried, I hear that the LR4 works with crystal litter, it just needs granules that will fit through the filter so it doesn't just dump it. You may have a rough go with the loose stools as it will definitely smear without being well-coated, but maybe mixing in a bit of clay will make it tolerable for that transition period.\n\n5. For the loose stools, I'd strongly recommend some Rocco and Roxie's litter deodorizer. It won't help with the mess and smells weirdly like cinnamon gum, but a sprinkle in the waste drawer and on the litter bed when topping up does a great job of combating the stank when Gandalf is having an episode. Assuming yours also make some extra stinkies, it should make the wait between poo and cycle a bit more tolerable. Plus it helps with odor escaping the drawer while the waste port is over the bin."", 'My guy has loose stools too- IBD, they say. Your experience and advice is helpful.

I'm new to litter robot it's on its way to me this week I'm just trying to learn as much as possible about them"", ""The pinch detect switch is the one you are referring to. I've utilized a very simple workaround that works perfectly to maintain the safety feature and not have it become intermittent due to moisture and debris causing it to fail. Just remove the bottom of the LR and go to the pinch detect switch, clean if needed, apply a generous glob of petroleum jelly to the contact points of the pinch detect switch. Make certain its completely encased (see pic below), once this is done, it will still function as normal but maintain a pristine electrical connection and prevent moisture and litter debris from intruding. Yes it will eventually collect a bunch of debris but it will stay on the outside of the glob and doesn't harm the connection inside. I've done this to all three of my LR3's and there hasn't been a single pinch detect error in over a year of utilizing this method! I've only seen maybe one or two actual safety bar detected messages occur, and it was one of the kitties actually getting too curious and getting a paw in the way while it was cycling back to the home position!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v01thv7036wa1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5411497fa5a39e5b591ded1bb0890f763c18540b\n\nThe other thing is to make certain your older DFI Emitter board is not suffering from moisture intrusion on the I/O chip pins and corroding. The new replacement DFI's address this issue, but the older DFI's can be repaired and resealed properly and they will last a long time, all of mine, I re-soldered and resealed with a clear coat and aside from an actual IC failure in one DFI, (I replaced one of the I/O chips) they have been working as intended and flawlessly!\n\nDoing the usual wipe down, cleanup and wiping of the bonnet connections on both the bonnet and base unit an occasional gearbox re-lube, that's pretty much it for the tips. Quite straight forward and simple!\n\nHope this helps?\n\nJust curious?, the unit that isn't working, what are it's failure symptoms?"", ""Can you describe your gear lube process? Some friends just got a LR3 and its MUCH quieter than my old one. I'm wondering if some lube may help."", ""I found every motor/gearbox has a different noise level. The reason being is the gear lash setting, (the distance between the drive gear on the motor output and the first reduction gear) The setting its self is crude and sloppy as there's a bit of play to work with between the mounting plate the motor fastens to and the gear reduction case the metal plate the motor is attached to fastens on to. Having a small 12 volt battery to power the motor while you work on the gear lash setting on a work surface is best to find the sweet spot noise wise and tighten things up.  You will notice one direction the motor travels in will always be a wee bit noisier than the other direction, its just the way it is!\n\nBut in any event you can get a general purpose grease and coat all the gears and the shafts they rotate on after cleaning the gears off of the old grease and any debris that might of got caught on the gears causing a taping sound while in use, (this is common to happen). Do NOT heavily pack the gear box with grease as this will cause excessive drag in the gear box and cause over torque faults! Instead just dip each gear in grease enough to coat it and the shafts, reinstall back in the gear box. \n\nTo access the gear box you need a 2.5mm Allen wrench to loosen the set screw on the black pinion gear to remove it off the output shaft, and a #2 Philips screwdriver to remove the 4 screws holding the gear box case halves together. Once the case halves are apart you will have full access to the gears, They install in a certain order and there is a small shaft collar or spacer on the third reduction gear shaft so don't loose that!!!

"['First question... What errors is it giving you? When it stops, the blinking lights actually mean things. Chances are, you have some of the more simple errors rather than the more complicated failures.   \n\n\nWith a total of NINE of the LR3 or connect models, 2 of which live in my RV full time and have put up with my 20 rescues using them non-stop (I have to replace the bag in each daily, b/c they don\'t have any other hobbies!)... These things are definitely being stress tested.   \n\n\nI will be the FIRST to say that they are over-designed and under-tested on their electronics, and the LR2 was much better about ""just working"". Things like the design of the weight sensor instead of a simple trigger switch - yeah, that wasn\'t an improvement. The nightlight or that stupid bonnet thing. ALSO not an improvement. The pinch connectors - this was a continuation of a bad design from the LR2, but at least it can be bypassed. But the king: That damned drawer-failure-board. What a TERRIBLE design.  \n\n\nStart with a fresh power supply that is rated for 15v and TWO amps (because it will use up to that) b/c the Chinesium power supplies don\'t last forever, and voltage drops when the motor is running - which can make the circuits do unpredictable things. So start with good power. These are cheap enough to always have at least one extra laying around.  \n\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09M6YSH13/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o08\\_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09M6YSH13/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)\n\nThey have their error code page on the website, but here\'s the main cheat sheet and a couple of additions since they have TWO MORE BLOODY CODES that not even the phone support know how to diagnose!  \nFlashing blue: Too much in the drawer. That one is easy.  \nFlashing red: There is a problem with the weight sensor / resistance is out of range / it won\'t reset. This can be bypassed but it isn\'t too expensive to replace.  \nFlashing Yellow: Here\'s where things get stupid. There are THREE reasons for this one: FAST flashing yellow is the pinch connector losing contact. SLOW yellow.... Can be EITHER the stupid bonnet connector lost electrical contact for a nanosecond (see about cleaning / bending the contacts) OR something stepped on the thing and the weight sensor registered the contact. This can ALSO be when the weight sensor is failing. Try bypassing the weight sensor first for testing.  \nNow the best one: FAST blue! Oh, that\'s not in the chart? Yeah.... I know. It\'s because what they will tell you is that ANY blue flashing means the drawer is full. NO IT DOES NOT. FAST blue means that the stupid DFI has FAILED ENTIRELY or their magical chip system is sending garbage that the blinky lights don\'t understand. There is NO WAY that I have found to bypass this stupid DFI yet. At least replacing it isn\'t too hard.  \n\n\nTo bypass the pinch contacts: Easy - unplug the pink connectors, and connect them together with a suitable piece of NOT ALUMINUM. Aluminum corrodes in the presence of ammonia. Guess what\'s in cat urine, in MASSIVE amounts! Brilliant design choice, Robots.   \n\n\nTo bypass the weight sensor: A little more complicated. Unplug the thing at the back of the compartment, and use a small amount of stranded copper wire twisted and bent in half to fit into the connector - why wire? This will add some resistance to the circuit and keep the system happy. Obviously it will not detect cat use, but that\'s OK... You can set it up with a smart plug or simple timer to run the thing every few hours, and that will be sufficient for the moment. Or forever, your choice.  \n\n\nBut even if you think that weight sensor is the only issue... It could STILL be the DFI because apparently that stupid thing can trigger OTHER errors when it is failing. I bypassed that on several of mine by pulling them out and (after covering in clear tape) taping the two boards together facing each other, and the taping it OUTSIDE the robot up on the bonnet. I\'m replacing the boards anyway, but this HAS worked to get two of them back running again from the hyper-blue-flashing.

Random repeated button pressing probably isn\'t helping either. It\'s only ""fundamentally"" broken if it\'s the first option. \n\nI think the people in this forum might have helpful advice if it\'s option 2, but you need to provide some details. What do you do when you clean it? Have you ever replaced the DFI sensors, pinch detectors, or wiring harness? Chances are, your problem falls in one of those areas and could be easily (and cheaply) fixable.

"[""I have a cat with a similar problem. I finally have put the robot to rotate after 3 minutes. The only problem with this is that it's not enough time for the pee to be thoroughly absorbed by the litter because she, nor my male cat, will cover their urine. So many times clumps of urine will stick to the roof. So it's a trade off. The only other thing that someone else recommended to me was  if the robot is inside of a room with a door....to put a microchip pet door in that room's door so that only the 1 cat can use it. \nI haven't done that as she will use 2 of the robots on the main floor. 1 in an office room, but the other is in the dining room. Not ideal, but we only use the dining room 3x a year. I didn't want to put both of them in the office because of tension between 2 of my girl cats. I needed somewhere where there would be no confrontations. The office is at the end of a hallway. So a bottleneck situation could occur. So far, it's working. I had 3 cats with 2 robots. I now have 3 cats and 4 robots. 2 upstairs, which hardly ever gets used, and 2 downstairs. They've all gravitated to the dining room one for some reason. \nWhat I really need is a robot that will toss some litter on top of the pee for my cats lol. I guess that would end up being a $1000 robot if they came up with it. \nBtw, I used to have this cat on Prozac. It ceased to work after 3 years of being on it.  When I'd finally had enough of her peeing outside of the robots, I put her upstairs with 2 robota for 2 months. I weaned her off the Prozac (since it wasn't working anyway) and I visited her 3x a day for play and petting etc. I had cameras on her robots so I could hopefully figure out why she sometimes peed outside the box. She was perfect the entire 2 months. Only 1x did she attempt to pee outside the box and that was when it had not rotated after she had peed and then 5 minutes later, she needed to poop. Instead of going to the other robot, she was going to pee on the robot steps, but I saw her and yelled at her. I hate that I yelled at her, but it was an automatic response. She didn't pee on the steps though. I manually rotated the robot. And a few minutes later, she went and used it again. After 2 months, I let her downstairs for short periods of time. That was a month ago and she's done great. However, she peed on the floor in front of the robot a few days ago because my other cat had peed in it and it hadn't rotated yet. I had it set on 15 minutes to help the litter absorb the pee of my non covering cats. She literally stuck her head in, came out and then peed on the floor. So now it's on 3 minutes. Sucks. I just wish she would go to the other box if the one she wants to use isn't clean! \nGood luck!""]"

Consider whether you have a kitty that would benefit from the ramp, so that they  will be able to get up there easily. The ramp combined with the fence helps contain a lot of the escaped litter too!\n\nThis is from a two-cat household where we previously had the litter box directly in the living room near the TV. The smell will be greatly reduced compared to having four open-air boxes, though you'll have to enjoy the fresh offerings for a bit until it's firmed up enough to let the robot cycle (it gets messy if you cycle too soon).""]"

It’s also helpful to take a scoop out of their old litter box along with a few clumps and put it in the LR. Smelling their own scent will encourage them to use it. Personally, I never did leave their old box out when I got the LR. Just made the LR smell like their old box and the went right in when they had to go.

I\'m happy with this addition......that being said it is absolutely RIDICULOUS for a device costing as much as this to be so problematic updating the firmware. It should be a ""point and click"" type thing. I had to follow the above steps but I also had to add resetting my WiFi (before you ask it is on its own dedicated 2.4ghz channel) which incidentally completely reset everything. I had to reregister my LR4 and finally I got it to update the firmware. I will say it possibly could have done it from the beginning, but I was expecting to see the white flashing light in the center of blue lights as described. I could not find anything about it updating and the single flashing white light not showing up at all so I figured it wasn\'t updating and moved to the next steps. If it was actually updating with no white light then there needs to be better information. Either way..... neither of those should be issues with a device this expensive.

It might cycle if the cats used it or it might not. I solved it by plugging in a night light in the room and turning the LR towards it so the robot’s light would never come on. Towards the end of my time with the LR3, it progressed into constant bonnet removed errors that I found were also related to me not consistently using the plugged in night light (like if I removed it to vacuum and forgot to plug it back in).', 'Mine was originally the LR3 (non-connect).

One of the sensors inside of it had some litter dust on it that needed cleaned off.

My LR3's are tortured well beyond the recommended cat to LR ratio and they keep on chugging along with the most preferred operating with well exceeding 33k cycles of use in the little over 2 years of use!!!\n\nThe liners in the LR3 are by far more durable, they are scratched all to hell on the surface but their integrity is still solid. There's no gap for urine to intrude at the front as the globe as no bezel in front of it.\n\nEdit: almost forgot I have the beige colored LR, the black shows up the litter dust far too well, great for knowing when they need a wipe down but in the same breath annoying to look at LOL!\n\nHope this assists you in your decision making process for which model is right for your situation?"", '1) I have heard issues with the liner ripping due to scratching and swore I would have that problem.

"[""Interesting you are getting the same dump position error with the new base. This tells me that the new base probably is not the issue but your globe. The globe has 2 ceramic magnets placed in two different locations with opposing polarities to differentiate between which is dump and which is the home positions. If you look at the rack gear that encompasses your globe you will see there are 4 pockets in the gear teeth, 2 of those pockets will have magnets in them, the other 2 will not. You can locate the magnets if you have a magnet handy (stronger the magnet the better!) and put it over the locations mentioned, it will either attract or repel the magnet you are using to test with. Find the magnet that is closest in location to the globe's dump port, stick the magnet to it and let it stay stuck to it for a few minutes, if your dump position magnet is weakened this will strengthen its magnetic field. While doing this clean the exterior of the globe of any and all debris and dust. after your finished with the wipe down make certain the base doesn't have anything collected on the top of it where the globe interfaces with. Pull the magnet off of the globe, replace the globe on the base making certain the black key at the rear of the globe is properly in the slot on the base, (failure to properly locate the black key will cause dump position faults!), Clean your bonnet electrical contacts, install on the base and test. Does this solve the dump position faults? If the globe is lifted even in the slightest while the magnets are over the hall effect sensors on the base its sensitive enough to no register the magnetic field so it vitally important to have both the globe and base free of most of the debris so the globe doesn't get lifted while rotating.\n\nIn rare instances I've had the drive motors cause dump position faults and even over torque errors. But to have the separate bases give the same error suggests its not likely the base causing the issue but something that hasn't been replaced or tested yet.\n\nJust a side note; your new open air base might not have the 4th connector on the control board populated for your connect daughter card unless you specified when purchasing?\n\nHope this helps?""]"

I’ve had to have a litter maid set up specifically for her, and that’s been a nightmare because with no way to section it away from the other cats, it fills up daily. I’ve hated the look of the LR3 since before I bought it, but who cares? It’s a litter box. Despite wanting a second one for my downstairs, I haven’t been willing to spend the extra $$ for the LR4 when I could get a second LR3 for $200 on Offerup (plus then they would match and my OCD would stay at peace). That is, until one night when I saw an ad for the LR4 and it occurred to me that the entry for it is SO MUCH MORE OPEN. Maybe it would be less intimidating and more within her open top comfort range. We bought one right then and there with the deal that we’d send it back if I couldn’t get her to use it. Well, she’s been using it consistently with no problems for the past two weeks.\n\nSo I suppose what I’m trying to say is that if you have a cat who is particularly skittish and/or sensitive to change/reluctant to use anything that isn’t an open top - go with the LR4.

If the green boards span the length of the plastic shield this is the older version DFI and I highly suggest a clearcoat be reapplied to the LEFT DFI board's I/O chip pins to further moisture proof it. This is a weak point of the older DFI board and will cause a failure about a year in to use.\n\nIf the board are short and centered in the middle and look like they are encased in plastic, this is the revised board set and no further action is required.\n\nThe next thing is to glob on the pinch detect switch contacts a generous amount of petroleum jelly totally encapsulating the contact points. The switch is in the same high moisture environment and will corrode or become loaded up with litter and or debris causing false pinch detect errors. the petroleum jelly will prevent this from happening and allow proper operation of the switch contacts.\n\nThe bonnet electrical connections on the left rear and on the base as will will need to be cleaned on occasion, (I do this to mine on a weekly basis, takes less than 30 seconds to do!) usually just using your finger and thumb to wipe the contacts off on the bonnet and base are all that's needed to keep things operating as they should.\n\nGeneral cleaning on the top of the base and around the globe is required to clear any dust of debris collecting on the exterior of the globe, the interior of the globe will need cleaning as well on occasion, takes about 3 to 5 minutes to do.\n\nKeep the LR3 on a flat hard level surface to assure no errant operation.

"[""I've done that a few times with the plastic shields, works like a charm!\n\nAll three of my Emitter boards of the DFI set had the corrosion issue. The detector boards as a rule don't have issues but wouldn't hurt to inspect. I repaired them by re-soldering the chip pins an haven't had an issue since!\n\nIf you have the skill to solder SMT parts, just apply flux paste and apply heat to the pins with a solder pencil, the clear coating will burn away quickly as it NOT a conformal coating that requires a fiberglass pen to remove, but rather a low temperature clear coat.  If needed use the fiberglass pen on any corroded chip pins to clear as much corrosion off prior to reflowing. Just remember you will need extra solder whether you have some high silver content solder or some 60/40 or equivalent rosin core solder because of the tarnishing and or corrosion if present will reduce the amount of usable existing solder. I also highly suggest reflowing pins 1 through 10 on the I/O chip this is always the suspect area of damage. The other side rarely needs reflowing with my experience. Once finished with the reflowing clean all the flux off /degrease, inspect your work for any gapped solder joints and apply a generous coat or 2 of clear coat to seal of the worked area. \n\nAfter the clearcoat is dry enough it should barring any unforeseen issues work perfectly as this is a permanent fix!.\n\nAnother neat tip since you are in the neighborhood, if you haven't already is to clean the pinch detect contacts, use a dielectric grease or petroleum jelly to completely encapsulate the contact points of the pinch detect switch. This will assure there's no possibility of moisture or debris intrusion. Yes the glob will collect debris over time  but it will be on the outside and not affecting the contact points in the inside!!!  I've done this to all three of my LR3's and I never have an issue with a false pinch detect in well over a year!"", 'AWESOME!, if you see my previous post here I also have a reliable workaround for the pinch detect contact points!.', 'The clear coat is similar to an automotive clear coat, so yeah,, but i found a nail polish clear coat works just as well at a fraction of the cost.\nLearning how to solder with SMT (surface mount technology) is the equivalent of diving in with both feet first! My best advice is heat control and flux is your friend! There are plenty of tutorials on how to solder on line that will help you learn quickly and what tools you will need to do the repairs, luckily its relatively inexpensive. You can use a standard rosin core solder with this repair along with flux paste to avoid closing the gap between the individual pins. And clean up as much of the corrosion as possible prior to performing the actual soldering, this will make the repair all that much easier.\n\nHope this helps?']"

If you have the older DFI board set and since its a year old its a given it does, it right around that timeframe for the moisture intrusion to cause corrosion on the I/O chip pins. If by chance the chip pins are still silver shiny, you need to chemically clean using some IPA or equivalent, apply another coating or two of clear coat to the chip, this will assure there will be no intrusion of moisture as a good chunk of the DFI boards out there of that version have insufficient clear coat protection. If there's corrosion present, clean it off the best you can and then apply the clear coat to stop any further corrosion.

The LR4 can be frustrating to troubleshoot, the app is often unhelpful (Whisker, please just put the KB in the app instead of making me find the PDF to decipher error codes), and it will often have connectivity issues.  My biggest gripe, though, is the capacity of the bin.  With two cats we are emptying it multiple times a week.  I am not sure if this is a function of the actual volume of the bin, or how the sensors read waste levels.  The lower gate also doesn't contain waste as well as the LR3, but I hear a replacement part is on the way to address that.\n\nIn terms of value, I can only measure how much time it is saving us over a traditional litter box, and right now, that isn't much if any.  I cannot measure things like odor containment which it does do well (provided it has captured all the urine) or keeping the dog out but emptying the LR4 and scooping a traditional box take just about the same amount of time, and they are needing it about as often.  The LR4 has also required a significant amount of troubleshooting time, which is not a requirement for a traditional box.\n\nI think much of this can be addressed with firmware updates, but it would be nice to see a base with greater capacity, or one with a hole in the bottom so you could place it over a larger container.  I have been thinking about designing my own and taking a Dremel to our existing one, but I would wait to do that until the warranty expires.  Looking forward to patches over the next 9 months to address these issues."", 'I bought my LR3 refurbished direct from Whisker. I\'d say it probably wasn\'t worth the high price - I paid \\~$550 (with extended warranty). \n\nBUT, it depends on your needs and expectations. As far as no longer scooping daily, yeah it\'s great. No more scooping. \n\nHowever, if you are mainly concerned about odor control,  I\'d say temper your expectations. There\'s definitely a need to frequently deep clean the globe and tray in order to control odor. I\'ve also spent quite a bit of time (and money) concocting a DIY solution to extending the ""no smell"" timeframe between emptying the bin. Carbon filters, odor neutralizers, humidity control, different types of litter, etc.', 'It’s probably the best one on the market, but it’s still terrible. Some people are lucky enough not to have issues but a lot of people do. Reading this sub, and based on the statistics of people who bother with subreddits/reviews, I’d guess you have a 60-70% chance of getting a good one. If you’re unlucky like the rest of us, though, you’ll spend far more time dealing with technical issues and the globe sticking in an unusable position, resulting in no place for your cat to go, than you ever spent scooping. I’d go back to our old setup in a heartbeat but I’m just hoping future firmware updates help make sense of the nearly $1k investment we have in this thing.  \n\nAlso, this thing takes up a ton of space so be prepared for that.', 'So I have a LR1 that I\'ve had since 2011 and an LR4 that I bought last year. I also have 1 traditional box in my bed room as my older kitty gets shut in with us at night while my young kitties do not.\n\nI would say the answer is: yes assuming you have that kind of disposable income. My LR1 is still working. In some ways it works better than the 4. We\'ve had to replace the panel on it once, and probably should again as the sensor really only registers if we give it a good shove, it no longer acknowledges cats, but it\'s put in a lot of good years.\n\nThe LR4 is finicky. I went with the 4 over the 3 because it claimed it would track usage of individual cats. It doesn\'t. It signifies by weight alone and my smaller 2 are too close in size for that to be helpful. The app is clunky and largely useless. User support should be a primary function, but is absent. Even ordering via app is clunky, and a company should really question it\'s choices when the UX for spending more money isn\'t simple and intuitive.. It requires a hard flat surface underneath. I can\'t use it in my carpeted bedroom, and I can\'t put it on a litter mat to cut down on litter spread. So now I have to sweep daily or constantly shove the mat back in place. It faults out regularly. Reading above I\'ll count myself lucky in that it usually faults out with the litter in place. I don\'t deep clean any of the boxes more or less frequently than the others. Every month or 2 a full dump and scrub is called for. I don\'t think you\'ll ever get around that. I feel they over promised and under delivered which is disappointing in a $700 litter box. When it\'s working correctly it is helpful. If I had to do it over again I\'d save some cash and go with the 3 as all of the ""upgrades"" between the two seem to largely be unhelpful or actively detrimental. \n\nOverall if the 4 was my only experience I wouldn\'t encourage you to buy in. However I love the original so much that I have hope they will be fixing their stuff so that I love the 4 eventually.', 'TLDR: Absolutely worth it for our home!  I have 2 LR3 for 2 years.  The way our schedule is, I gladly pay for the convenience. \n\nI started with 1 LR knowing I have no qualms to sending something back in the time frame. I had 4 cats, one who was blind, one 3legged-1 eyed cat who’s missing leg is a front one (not good at covering deposits due to this), and 2 “normalish” other cats.  They all took to it well, surprisingly. Had to empty the drawer about every 2-3 days. Realized how amazing it was with odor control and no scooping twice daily, I ordered a second LR. \n\nThen we found a kitten at a gas station. He took to it with no issues.  He’s now 19 pounds and fits still, but I do notice he pees on the front edge of the litter, but it still empties in the bin fine. \n\nSince then my 19 y/o blind cat died and we adopted a “terminal” older cat (heart worms).  When we first brought her home, we didn’t know the terminal part, just that she had been at the shelter, was at a foster with nervous issues and needed a good home because she was “special”.  Oddly enough, she figured out the LR just fine. \n\nSo total of 5 adult cats. 2 LR. I empty  the bins every 4ish days. I’ve bought my friend’s LR but haven’t picked it up yet because it didn’t work out for his cat (I’m not sure why, but I had talked the LR up and don’t mind having another). Plus we have the room for it. \n\nOne of the best things this has allowed is for us to take trips without worrying about the litter boxes.  This is HUGE because we hate asking someone to come empty them.  Of course the app lets me know it’s working and I put a camera in the room to keep an eye on them also. \n\nI’ve changed litter a few times to find what is best for us (fresh step right now). When I tried the boxy brand, I had so many issues with it malfunctioning. \n\nI do disassemble it and take the ball of it outside and hose and soapy water it clean at least twice a year and wipe it down with baby wipes in between (convenience again). \n\nThe worst problem I’ve had, I spoke about above.  I’m sure it was some kind of sensor issue, but it resolved. \n\nI’ve often said that if my LR breaks, I would treat the situation as I would if my clothes dryer quit.  I would buy another.  No question.  \n\nSide note: last week our area was hit hard by tornado and although we were unscathed, we had no power from Fri-wed night. Scooping daily, I realized again how much I love the convenience of automatic litter box. Plus I realized how much wasted litter with scooping each time.  \n\nSorry for the novel, and I hope that somewhat answers your question for my opinion.', ""We have had ours for just over a year. After a year, pinch detect kept going off, said it was full when it wasn't, etc. I replaced the dfi sensor and bypassed the pinch detect,  recalibrate the sensor, etc. I've spent too many hours over the weekends trying to figure out how to get it to work reliably again to no avail. It worked great for a year though and my husband really appreciated the low oder aspect. One year isn't enough to warrant the price for me. I'm here looking for alternatives. Otherwise I will get a litter box credenza with a hooded litter box inside and just manually clean it. More reliable and less effort since I don't have to spend hours and days trying to figure out how to fix it."", 'I would note that I am considering retiring our pair of LR3 after about a 1.5 year trial. The thing that gets me is the smell. We never had an issue with a traditional litter box smelling. However, as soon as we set up the robots, we started getting the typical litter smell. This isn’t due to urine pooling or anything like that like some have reported. It’s simply a matter of the waste sitting more or less out in the open, unburied, in the drawer. \n\nThis is contrasted to it normally being buried in the traditional litter box where the litter can contain the odors. We’ve tried several different litters and none really make a difference, which isn’t surprising as they can only really lightly coat the waste and don’t have a chance to really absorb the odors (I set the delay to the max to try and alleviate this with no success.\n\nI tried new carbon filters, the odor absorbing packs, baking soda, a hepa filter by the robots…everything I could think/read of. The only thing that really helps is to clean out daily and/or change bags daily, which is really…wasteful and no benefit over scooping daily.\n\nI know not everyone has this issue. It’s possible one of our cats just has extra smelly…stuff. But I would be advised.', ""My only regret is that I didn't buy it when I first saw it. It has changed our lives.\n\nBefore, with three cats, my wife had to get up daily and scoop before the morning feeding or our female tabby would not use the box.  The same scooping was required evening. On top of mitigating the constant scooping and filling, and changing, the odor could become problematic at times.\n\nIt took a few weeks for the cats to acclimate, but I have learned to use this thing and keep it clean to such a high degree of satisfaction that I can honestly say its the easiest litter solution that I have ever had in 25 years of cat ownership.\n\nIt can be quirky at times but support is responsive. There are a few features that often need attention, but in the end, it's no real labor.\n\nA note: we have tried two other top-brand automatic litter boxes that two of our cats would just not use and the cost of the specialized litter was ridiculous. We use Arm and Hammer quick clump and also at times, the LitterRobot brand. A very dusty litter is problematic, but the low dust options are spot on. \n\nGet the box... you will love it."", 'One of the BEST purchases I have ever made. I bought the LR3 back in 2015. I loved it until after about 5 years it started having major issues. We replaced so many sensors and components but it just felt like we were putting band aids on it. Parts were becoming corroded and at that point I couldn’t trust it and feared my 3 cats would find other places to go to the bathroom…. So I would manually cycle the LR3. When I heard the LR4 was coming out I was nervous as I’ve heard it’s had some issues but I couldn’t help myself and bought it and received in August 2022. I LOVE THE LR4. I’m afraid to say I haven’t had any real issues as I don’t want to jinx myself…. The only thing I’ve had an issue with is when I fill the globe up with more litter I just turn the litter robot off and on again. I found a few occasions that if I just pressed the reset button I had issues with it stopping when cycling…I’m assuming because of the weight. Other than that it’s perfect. I also bought the ramp attachment. So I attached my LR3 ramp to the LR4 with it. Lastly, I’ve been using the arm and hammer slide litter and set the time to 15 minutes-works amazing and looks like a freshly cleaned litter bed every time.', 'Its worth the price if your cats actually use it. \n\nI also have two cats, but only one of them uses the LR. The other cat is deathly afraid of the machine, for some reason. So, I have to have a normal litter box and the LR which makes it kinda not worth it as now I have to manage both which defeats the whole purpose. \n\nSo, if either of your cats are skittish or you think might be afraid of it, it might not be worth it.', ""What they don't tell you is yes there is significantly less scooping, it's never no scooping, but there is a daily maintenance for this machine. It's refilling the litter level every day and unclogging clumps that stick to the liner. My cat likes to pee in one spot so there's a place the clump likes to stick to. It's also good practice to wipe down the poop chute every week as it can get gross with pee and poop clumps streaking.\n\nBut overall, it is worth it for the happiness of the cats. They love a clean bed of litter and it does help with the smell as long as you replace the carbon filter every few months."", 'I have 5 cats and two litter robots. I 100% think they are worth the money. I am by no means rich. These were HUGE purchases for me. They are not completely set it and forget it.

It is a serial communication device tasked with receiving and sending information to the control board. In the LR3's case when requested it sends onfo on the ir beams and the pinch  detect statuses. On bootup of the control board, the LR then does a series of self checks, the very first check it does is the DFI beam check, if its receiving it then goes to the pinch switch status, if its making contact it then goes to checking the weight sensor, bonnet, then home and dump position sensors as it does the start up cycle. But if the DFI is unable to send any data to the control board it immediately throws the drawer full error and when reset is pressed tries to skip to the next check which is the pinch detect and of course since them both are handled by the DFI it throws the pinch detect error and cant go any further in the self check. The pins on the I/O chip on the emitter board that always get disconnected due to corroded solder joints are the  ground, reset and initialization pins.

If so you need to remove the bonnet and check the metal contacts on the left rear of the bonnet. Check for any dirt coating them or if there is urine intrusion on the contacts causing corrosion. The contacts should be smooth to the touch and shiny. Also check the corresponding contact points on the base as well for the same.\n\nIf you do have corrosion, use a scouring pad, fine grit sand paper or steel wool to wipe clean all four contacts on the bonnet and base. Once smooth and shiny reassemble and see if this solves your concern. Also if you have your night light on make certain that you see three (3) blue lights illuminated, if there are not three illuminated and the night light is on it will also give the bonnet removed error as well. You can get around this by turning the night light off.\n\nThe louder cycling is because the drive motor gear box is most likely running dry of lubrication.

One who doesn\'t like to use a litter box that\'s ""used"". I used to have just 2 robots.  If the robot didn\'t spin quick enough after she peed and she needed to poop, She\'d poop in the hallway instead of making the trip upstairs to the 2nd robot. And vice versa. Poop in box...needing to pee...pee on the robot steps. I couldn\'t figure out her problem. I also had an open 30 gallon Rubbermaid tote for an older cat who likes the low opening. But SHE would never use that since it could only be cleaned once I got home from work. \nSo, final straw was her peeing on a brand new area rug. I decided to put her upstairs. She had the entire 2nd floor to herself. I purchased a reconditioned robot. So she had 2 robots to herself. I took away the steps and what do you know...she never peed or pooped outside of the box. I knew this would be a slow process and I was in no hurry. I visited her 3x a day for play and brushing and feeding,etc.  I noticed that she still flew out of the robots like a bat out of hell and always peed at the opening of the robot..making it hard for the litter to absorb her pee which then created a clump that would stick to the roof upon rotation. So my husband built a ramp for her and covered it with an artificial grass rug. Hard to pee on an inclined ramp. After that I noticed she started to pee in other places instead of just the opening and 90% of the time she covers her pee. She always covered her poop. Go figure! \nAnyway, it\'s been 2 months with her upstairs. Visits by me and the male cat 3x a day.  Today, she came downstairs for the first time. She is still not allowed to be downstairs unsupervised for now. I have 2 robots on the lower floor as well. She was also on Prozac for the last few years, but it had quit working. So I\'m also weaning her off of it slowly. She also doesn\'t love the other female cat. I really should say, the female cat doesn\'t love her, but in any case, they tolerate each other and don\'t fight. \nAll this to say. That I think the litter robots are fantastic and I have zero regrets buying them. And with the 4s being released, there are a lot of them for sale on fbook and other places. \nI\'m hoping having 4 robots will fix her issue and she can be part of the family again. She still has another 3 weeks or so before her Prozac is completely stopped. So I\'m still going to keep her upstairs when she can\'t be supervised. \nI don\'t think her inappropriate elimination would have been solved with regular litter boxes since she won\'t use one that\'s been used. I\'ve been dealing with her problem for almost 5 years. I scooped 3x a day. Morning, after work. And before bed. I had 5 litter boxes.

"[""From all the posts I've seen positive and negative about the LR4, its a crapshoot, either they work great out of the box or they become an almost immediate nightmare afterwards. This has really made me hesitant over eventually pulling the trigger on an LR4, not to mention the urine intrusion issue because of the two piece bezel/globe design. But on the other hand it does have a different sensor system and the drive motor is very quiet in operation.\n\nFor the past two years I have owned 3 LR3's and at first they were a hand full to say the least to keep running, but after I learned of the few quirks the LR3 has and how to successfully work around them they have been reliable workhorses since!!!\n\nYes the kitten has to be at least 2.3 Kilos for the weight sensor to activate but as kitty grows this shouldn't be much of an issue. But you can let kitty use the LR and either manually cycle or get a smart outlet and set a scheduled power cycle that will take care of the lack of temporary weight sensor triggering.\n\nIMHO the LR3 is the better option until the LR4 has its major issues ironed out and becomes as stable as the LR3 can be made to be!"", 'I haven’t had any issues with my LR4. I have had the LR3 for several years. I think 2? \n\nMy cats ADORE the 4. They’ve stopped using the 3 entirely.  \n\nI find it’s quieter and has better smell control. And I don’t have as many issues with the robot thinking the tray is full when it’s not.', ""We went with the LR4, mostly because of the larger opening. It's a shame that there were so many problems for people *after* the release, but Whisker isn't hard to work with, nor as slow to respond as we sometimes do see people talk about - but if you contact them via the app, it hasn't taken us more than 24-72ish hours to be responded to from what my husband claims. To be fair,  they weren't much help via actually speaking on the phone and we communicated mostly online and were, on more than one occasion given an apology, and told that they would be rolling out another update, etc.\n\nThe LR4 did not necessarily work flawlessly for us at first, but when we set it up they were doing firmware updates nonstop to try and fix it for a lot of people that either had that problem and for people that might otherwise have it in the future I would assume. The main issue we had was that it wouldn't complete a cycle automatically more than once (if that) before it would stop under an assortment of errors. We ended up cleaning the robot manually for a little less than a few weeks but did find that unplugging or powering it off and then on triggered its usual cycle and saved us from that chore now and then. \n\nNow, the LR4 is a dream and has been since the issues were resolved after a month or a little more I think. My current biggest complaint would have to be that the cameras and bezel that they're positioned in are now consistently giving me an error via the Whisker app (used to manage the LR) to clean them, though I've done so under what they tell you to do. Using a microfiber cloth and NO cleaning sprays/etc are what is needed. There is a trick some use with a can of condensed air to blow directly into the bezel with is often used to clean other electronics, though I have yet to try it. The LR4 still works very well, though I do wonder if the cameras are having issues seeing the level of waste since as soon as I change it, it claims it's at 20% lol\n\nYou'll want a pack of wipes to clean any mess a clumsy kitty might spray in the wrong place no matter which LR you get. I don't recall if LR3 has one, but the LR4 has a litter guard that attaches to the bottom of the outer casing (the thing that the globe is positioned in, so it won't turn with the globe, and isn't in the way) and it does help to keep things a little cleaner in blocking litter being kicked out. Usually, I just very quickly wipe off the easily accessible parts with said wipes when I need to change the waste bag underneath the globe which is about once a week for my one plus-size cat. He grew accustomed to it very quickly. You'll need to make sure the LR is on hardwood, vinyl, etc. No carpet and you want it to be a level floor. You will want a litter mat as well of course. I know my cat likes to launch his butt out when he's done and if there's that or a more aggressive kitty with trying to bury his mess, this is a good option. We want to rave about ordering more of the supplies you need from Whisker (convenient for us). They will ship out litter, waste bags, and other accessories you may want. They have these things called odor blockers and while they work very well with how quickly the mess is dropped into the lower bin and bag, I also want to say that it hasn't been necessary for the time being.\n\nGood luck!! 👍 😁"", ""I am cheap. I bought the base model LR3, Costco litter, and Costco 10 gallon bags. Also bought the LR ramp and fence/guard which both help with litter tracking. Works perfect. No issues with my 2 cats.

There is an option on the app in the settings section that DOES give access to a troubleshooting guide and manual/instructions for both LR3&4 separately. If you utilize the app and go through this method, it would be a great start.\n\nWhen we went through this and downloaded the aforementioned guide/instructions/manuals/more info, following the troubleshooting steps as advised etc, we had a lot more luck and a surprisingly fast connection to their customer support when/if you need to file a ticket - best done through the app to begin with.

I used to work in the field and quickly learned that 8/10 people will complain vs the 2/10 that will rave in delight over everything to others. People often don't NEED to post and talk about all the good stuff vs others who are already riled up over confusion and looking for both help & an area to vent their frustration.

Focusing on Lights, LR3 will show 4 options from what I understand and LR4 has 7, including one for when there are multiple colors. This is meant to tell these people what the issue could be. When we select one that details what we see and looks like what we're dealing with, it continues to try and guide us in fixing the issue. It worked for me when I went down that route a while back. I get that it may be a complex issue that most can't fix on their own, such as a firmware update which is what we initially needed. To fix that kind of thing or something else was out of our control, we can rely on Whisker. Actually getting a response didn't take long for us at the start. I also understand that wait times may have suddenly increased, but waiting a day or two wasn't that huge of a deal for me with this kind of product. I need to also confess that this issue was not the last and while I did type out more, I felt it easier to condense for now 🤔\n\nTLDR? It was a headache during my first impression and I feel BADLY for anyone needing to do the same kind of things to fix it and modify how to deal in the meantime.

"[""Our situation is a bit unique, We have 3 LR3's in a rescue that currently houses 32 cats, a majority of them have their favorite LR, (that poor LR, over 1600 cycles a month on average!) but all 3 get used.

(four items that completes the key assembly).\n\nThe weight sensor is most likely either out of adjustment or damaged/out of spec, to test this:\n\nWith the LR in its ready state, (blue light on solid) press down on the top of the bonnet till you feel the spring tension bottoming out solid, then let go.

Tighten it too little and it will mimic the same issue you are having now, tighten it too tight and it can potentially get oversensitive, then unresponsive.

It’s better than the LR was (my first LR lasted a LONG freakin’ time, like 7+ years) but it gets funky in weird places. Any litter in the gearbox can really mess with the mechanism, though that didn’t happen too often. \n\nAlso, it was loud. I mean, it’s white noise, so it’s not too bad. But I could hear it going off from 2 rooms away. And it really seemed like it needed to be emptied WAY more often. We had 4 cats at the time, and it was about once every three days. The previous LR had been roughly every 4 days. This might be mostly laziness on my part, though, since the litter drawer was physically larger on the LR3, but the 3 had a sensor and stopped running if it was full. But I THINK the shape of the drawer didn’t help distribute the clumps very well, so they kinda mounded up and caused the sensor to say it was full when it wasn’t, really. \n\nBut after a few years, one of the sensors in the  LR3 went wonky and it started staying upside-down a lot. I called the helpline and troubleshooted it, got a new sensor, took the thing apart (nontrivial but simple enough) and fixed it. It worked great! For about three months. Then upside-down again. I ordered the part again and fixed it again. It didn’t help. Tried troubleshooting it again, don’t know what was wrong. Replaced the main board, too. That worked for a few days.

It has greatly improved my quality of life though."", 'I don’t think anyone got a litter robot because it will save them money. If anything, we are paying a premium to save time and make our life easier. With that said,  the break even just on the cost of the litter robot is 67 months. I’m sure there’s a point where you will start seeing a saving but it probably won’t be 6-9 years from now.', 'We were spending about $180/mo on litter alone before we got the litter robot 4.  We now spend about $30/mo on litter and supplies.  So I can say that for us we are saving money.  We had 2 boxes for 4 cats before, and used fresh step crystal litter.  Now we use just the one litter robot.\n\nAside from the saving money pitch, the box is a few minutes a day (less than 5) to empty the drawer, put in a new liner, and add some litter (1 or 2 cups).  We do a thorough cleaning once a week.  We only have the one LR4 now. Instead of 2 boxes.  So the convenience factor is a big deal for us.  \n\nOdor-wise, the LR4 isn’t any better than the old set up.  We don’t use a scented litter, though.  We put two of the odor packs from Whisker in the drawer, and that helps.  The old boxes did get a bit smelly toward the end of the week when we would clean the two boxes.\n\nI also feel like the cats are a bit happier.  Their litter is clean all the time when they go, and it’s not as stinky.  \n\nThe “never scoop again” is mostly true, and that’s worthwhile to me.  Once in a while, waste gets stuck where the litter doesn’t get at it and we have to use a litter scoop to get it into the litter area.

"[""In my opinion it would be more economical to refurb the LR3 you have.\n\nId replace a few wear items though to get it back in new like operation though such as:\n\nWeight sensor:\n\nThese can drift out of spec over time causing either an over sensitivity or a lack of sensitivity. It fairly easy to replace, you can get the nut holding the pressure plate close to where it was on the shaft before which in most cases is good enough and will require a simple user performed recalibration once everything is assembled.\n\nDFI / pinch kit:\n\nYour LR most likely has the older version DFI that is prone to moisture intrusion causing the dreaded blue flashing light. Id check first to see what version is there.\n\nGlide buttons:\n\nThese wear down over time and can cause excessive drag on the pinion gear evident by the excessive bobbing up and down of the globe while in a clean cycle.\n\nThose items would cost about $50 total, and will solve the glitching issues commonly found with the LR3.\n\nThings id refurbish first before replacing:\n\nDrive motor/gearbox:\n\nAfter years of use with no servicing the gearbox will require a re-lube, fortunately is quite simple to do. Remove the black pinion gear off the drive shaft, then remove the 4 screws holding the gear box case halves together,  clean and reskim all the gears and shafts they ride on with a general purpose grease, then reassemble. this should smooth out and quite down a bit the drive motor noise.\n\nGlobe liner:\n\nI found most of the time the liner has a whitish gray film on it that is a calcium buildup from urine interacting with the clay clumping litter. This can be removed with a product called CLR, apply wait 10 to 15 minutes, scrub with a plastic brush and wash clean, repeat for any spot missed. Then use a general purpose cleaner to clean the liner off. You can use a rubber nourishing product of choice to soften the PVC/ rubber composite the liner is made out of to restore most the elasticity if needed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bonnet removed errors are usually caused by the contacts getting debris on them and or urine corrosion. If there's no corrosion and they look shiny and smooth, you can gently clean the contacts on both the base and bonnet and it should work just fine with weekly wipe of the contacts that takes less than 20 seconds to do.\n\nPinch detect switch contacts:\n\nWhat I do to assure there are no issues with this is to make certain the contact points are clean and then apply a generous glob of petroleum jelly or dielectric grease to the actual contact point. This assures it remains clean and making contact.

"[""When you replaced the weight sensor, I'm assuming you put the nut close to where it was on the bolt originally? (this method get it roughly in the right position) If so?, good enough!\n\nLets do some rudimentary testing! You should be able to perform these test no problem. Do you have a VOM, if so, great!. If not?, No problem!.\n\nIf you have the VOM you can test the continuity between the control board and your weight sensor blue wire to verify it still has a connection.\n\nIf not, here's the other way to do it! we will use the LR at the VOM!. What ill have you do is bypass temporarily the weight sensor by shorting the wire harness going to the weight senor to verify the damaged wire is good or not?. All you need is a bare metal small paperclip, pull aside the small loop of the paperclip so its free of the larger outer loop. Unplug the weight sensor, then take the paperclip small end and insert it to the opening of the black connector where the two pins are sticking out of the connector so the paperclip is shorting together electrically the 2 pins inside the black connector, make certain its making contact with both pins. With the bonnet on only, power up the LR, It should boot up with the usual status lights illuminating in sequence and power button with multi color illuminations, then the cycle light will go to a solid yellow light and the motor should start running.  You might have to fiddle with the paperclip a few times to make certain you have a good connection, I was testing my test unit earlier and it was intermittent till I got a good connection with consistent results.\n\nIf you have a consistent red flashing light, either the connection is not being made by the paperclip or your wire most likely is damaged.\n\nIf you cant get the motor to start up no matter how much you fiddle with the paperclip if safe to say the wire is open and this is your issue.\n\nIf you still have a flashing red light:\n\nLets check the wire integrity, go to where the crimp is in the insulation of the blue wire, with both hands hold the wire on both sides of the suspect area, with a firm grip TRY to stretch the wire apart.\n\nDoes the area of the crimp stretch and get thin? If so there's where you need to cut the wire, strip the insulation leaving enough bare wire to twist together and use electrical tape to insulate the repair.  Of you can get a replacement wire harness, its up to you with whatever your skillset is and which you wish to pursue?.\n\nIf the insulation does not stretch?, its most likely good as the copper wire will not stretch easily if its NOT broken.\n\nCuriosity? When you are putting weight on the base are you doing so with your hand through the waste port pressing the bottom of the waste drawer opening? If so you are breaking the beams the DFI emits simulating the drawer full indication. If not? please disregard this. I caught myself doing this when I was doing the testing on my LR and I had to ask, LOL!!!\n\nLet me know what the results were and we can go from there if more testing is needed to determine the issue."", 'Holmes1, I initially liked your post as I was at work. Thanks for your thoughtful response! I may just try to find a deal on a new or used base, as I spent 4 hours trying to fix this the other night and only made things worse. I’m also concerned that I smashed the cat sensor somehow, as this was a warning when I did that repair. I’m afraid I’m out of my depth, but I imagine others will find it useful!', ""No worries, as I said to the other poster, I respect your choices in the matter, and yes this has potential to help others as well so its all good!\n\nFar as your weight sensor is concerned, no need to worry about smashing it. The LR uses an anchor point on the base as a fulcrum to hold the transfer plate while the weight foot's bolt and nut attached to the transfer plate acts as the mechanical motion to apply spring tension to the weight sensor via the rubberized pad. That pad allows for quite a bit of give. The pressure on the weight sensor allows the sensor to register resistance for the LR. So in the strictest of senses the weight sensor is a pressure activated variable resistor. When the LR is ready to use with no litter in the globe and waste in the drawer, the resistance reading averages anywhere between 400 and 600 OHMs, (every individual weight sensor varies in its readings) when weight is applied the pressure lessens on the sensor which allows the resistance reading to go up till it get up anywhere from 3 to 7K OHMS in value, then it will go directly to an open circuit or Out of Limits. if you had the LR sensing weight after the weight sensor was replaced you had SUCCESS! There is room for variances in adjustment of the weight sensor, If you used how many turns the nut took to loosen and remove from the bolt that will get you close enough in most cases, heck, even eyeballing it or taking a before pic and after pic of the nut position on the bolt is often enough to get it close. But to get the most accuracy out of the sensor a VOM is a must!\n\nPlease don't doubt your self and your capabilities in your repair attempts, you're way ahead of most people out there as you were able to get in to it and replace parts!!!! and accidents will happen sometimes. My best advice to you if you have anything like this you are trying to repair in the future is to slow down and practice methodical patience in your actions. When I was starting out in repairing various things years and years ago I made the same mistakes, hell I still make mistakes from time to time, I see them as an opportunity to learn rather than a frustration. Plus I've learned a nasty habit of being a little bit enthusiastic when it comes to me repairing anything, especially these LR3's!!! I've had all 3 of mine that are in service completely apart multiple times for general maintenance, cleaning, and have solved many of issues with them when they cropped up!!! and now they are 99.98% trouble and error free! And they do endure EXTREME usage, the cats here are savages!\n\nAs I said in the previous posting to you, I think the wire might be damaged as your symptom you are seeing with the LR (flashing red light) is that of the weight sensor not being plugged in. And if you had success with the weight sensor before replacing the DFI it was working until you accidently crimped the weight sensor wire and started getting the flashing red light afterwards, that's most likely your issue.""]"

Another trick I found useful is to initially set the lash dry with no grease, then add grease afterwards and see how it sounds, then adjust further to fine tune.

"[""Yes, I've experienced this when the gearbox ran dry of lubrication. Why its throwing over torque errors even with the gearbox not physically driving anything is because the gears start to chatter on the shafts they spin on due to inadequate or dried out lubrication, this creates significant drag on the drive motor causing a current draw from the LR's main board, this draw get to a certain point and triggers the over torque fault.\n\nThe motor its self isn't serviceable but its not the issue, as a test you can use a 2.5mm Allen wrench to remove the black pinion gear off the output shaft and a #2 Philips screwdriver to remove the 4 screws holding the case halves together. separate the case halves and you will see there's barely a skim coating of dampening grease on the gears and shafts. Add a few drops of general purpose oil to the shafts them selves and coat the gear teeth if you choose and reassemble. test it out and I bet the over torque fault will vanish! If it does use some light duty general purpose grease to coat the gears and shafts reassemble and test it again. Don't put any more than a light coating of grease on as if you put too much it will cause significant drag on the motor causing your original concern, Ask me how I know this?!\n\nEven if your LR is still in warranty, lubing the gearbox will allow your LR to be put back in proper service sooner than if you were to wait for them to validate a trouble ticket and get a replacement base unit or even a motor/gearbox sent out!\n\nHope this helps.""]"

She eventually goes, she never digs just lays it on top (can be smelly temporarily).  The last  cat is part bengal, she digs a lot and when she pees it's like she's doing downward dog.  I've had to pull the thing apart to clean it already because of her.  She does seem to like it though, they all do.  It really locks in the smell, I work from home 8 ft from it and rarely smell it (except when they are making poop). It's a godsend for us.  I have to change the bag about every other day and I drop a 12 oz cup of litter in it about daily.\n\n1.

"['I’m not sure if this is the same thing, but I was recently having a similar issue where the box would begin a cleaning cycle & stop, giving the red light. Pressing the reset button would let it turn for another few seconds, then it would stop again. I had to keep pressing reset to get it to finish the cycle. This only started happening after I took out the globe to clean it. \n\nAs some other users have said, you should definitely check the app & make sure your robot is up-to-date on software (select your robot, select ‘Controls’, then ‘Robot Information’. If there’s an update, it will say so in this area). Also, I would give the unit a full clean, just in- case, as follows: \n\n- take out the globe & rinse it out with water & gently scrub the liner with dawn dish soap, rinse well & let FULLY dry\n\n-Take a vacuum hose & vacuum the entire base while the globe and waste drawer are out. Try using the vacuum to clear any debris/hair/dust that may have accumulated near the sensors (be gentle)\n\n-Take a microfiber towel & clean the sensors gently\n\n-Empty the waste drawer & place a new bag. Ensure the bag is laying as flat as possible in & around the drawer (snugly fit it). I don’t know if this actually does much, but in my head I feel it may help to reduce interference with the waste drawer sensors.\n\n-Once the globe is fully dry, I sometimes go back in one more time with a disinfecting wipe & wipe out the inside of the globe. Using a microfiber towel, wipe off the exterior of the globe before replacing it on the base. Make sure the filter is clean as well.\n\n-Now that your waste drawer & globe are in the unit, close the bonnet. Slightly under-fill with litter of choice (sometimes, even if it’s filled to the ‘line’, an excess of litter can throw off your LR & give an error.). Press the ‘Reset’ button to zero out your waste drawer. \n\n-Ensure your litter robot is on a flat, LEVEL surface\n\nOk now, try cycling your robot. If it is still giving the error, try changing the position/location of the robot to make sure it’s level, &/or turn off the unit & turn it back on. \n\nIn my case, since I had already cleaned the robot & sensors, removing some litter & changing the position of my LR4 totally fixed the errors, & it has been running perfectly ever since. \n\nHope this helps!! \n-Fellow Kitty Parent', 'I have bought two of them.

I like the four because it tells you how much litter is in the box which is important with my four because if they pee a lot obviously the litter gets used up.

Another great thing is that you can send the unit in whenever you want for a tune up for $180 and that includes shipping. They'll replace the motor, wiring harness, circuit board, carbon filters and sealing strips and also any worn out parts. I did notice that sensors were not included. But paying $180 every 5 years sure beats buying a new one for $700+. But it's nice to know that I can purchase all those things and do it myself if needed.

Gently pull up and disengage the control board from the cover and once free look for the red and white wires to the left of the control board with the pale pink connectors, make certain they are connected to the brown and green wires. If you have a 12 volt battery you can test the motor's functionality separate of the LR.\n\nThe weight sensor can cause a solid yellow light after bootup of the control board with no motor functionality if the sensor is close to a total electrical short. To test for this possible situation, pull the waste drawer out and you will see in the bottom back of the base the blue and black wires with a black connector. Hold the very bottom of the black connector and at the vert top of it pull up gently and the connector will disengage. Once disengaged put the bonnet on only and power up the LR it should boot up to a slow flashing red light, if you have a red slow flashing light this is normal for the situation. Next, find your self a small metallic paperclip, (metal with no coating on it). use the small loop end of it and on the wire side of the connector plug it in so the paperclip is shorting the 2 pins together.

When you see the Red light flashing fast you can let go and if the LR hasn't gone to a solid blue light only  afterwards just press reset and it will.\n\nThis procedure is done to recalibrate the weight sensor. Now try to put some slight weight on the bonnet of the LR and see if the red cat timer activates?\n\nIf it still does not activate or if it does when only excessive weight is applied to the LR then you need to replace the weight sensor.\n\nThis Job is fairly easy and it made very simple if you have a VOM, (Volt Ohm Meter) to read the resistance as the nut it tightened on the weight sensor plate. As the nut is tightened on the new sensor the resistance will at first be very high or out of limits, as the nut is tightened the resistance will slowly drop till you reach the lowest resistance which typically is around 400 to 600 Ohms. Each sensor has it's varying specs so no one sensor will have the same exact ohm range at its lowest reading. Tightening it too tight will increase the resistance reading hence desensitizing the weight sensor.\n\nAfter so many thousands of cycles, the weight sensor tends to desensitize gradually and the ohm reading increases to the point it take extra weight to trigger the LR to the threshold where the resistance is high enough, (typically around the 1k to 6K ohm range) to tell the LR on startup the weight sensor is returning as functional on power up. But the resistance is too high for it to read an increase in resistance to trigger the cat timer. This is what I'm suspecting is going on in your situation.\n\nIf you need a replacement weight sensor go [HERE](https://www.robotshop.com/products/litter-robot-3-open-air-cat-sensor) to order it. It fairly cheap and should get your LR back up and running! Once the sensor is replaced, you can fasten the nut on the bolt the same amount of turns it took to remove to get it close to where it was before, or use the more accurate ohm meter method for the manual calibration.\n\nBTW if the weight sensor has developed an intermittent short, this will also cause the LR after the main board boot up to go directly to a slow flashing blue light mimicking a DFI failure or drawer full indication.\n\nHope this helps you out!""]"

"[""The DFI sensor in the drawer shouldn't be an issue as it most likely is working as it should if you are getting the slow flashing yellow light.\n\nLets do some basic diagnosing...\n\nMake certain the LR is on a solid level surface, nothing touching on the sides, and the globe was not overfilled filled with litter.\n\nThe bonnets electrical connection is clean and the night light (three blue LEDs) are on and bright? if not this will cause a slow blinking yellow light. pull the bonnet off and on the left rear the base and bonnet will have 2 metal tangs. clean both on the base and bonnet, Kitty litter dust and sometimes urine can get on them causing issues. Reconnect and see if the concern persists.\n\nIf the bonnet isn't the issue the weight might be too sensitive and its falsely telling the LR there's a weight increase while it cycling when its just the vibrations of the LR in mid cycle.\n\nIf the concern persists, then the next step is to recalibrate the weight sensor. To do this empty the globe and waste drawer, reassemble and power cycle the unit, once its finished with the cycle without touching the LR aside from the control board buttons, press at the same time and hold for 5 to 6 seconds the Empty and Reset buttons. You will see the red light flash fast for a few seconds then the blue ready light should be only on, if anything other then the blue light is on just press reset and then test the LR again with litter in the globe.\n\nIf you still have the concern then pull the waste drawer out and tighten the weight sensor nut in the bottom back 1/2 turn clockwise, (desensitizing the weight sensor slightly) and again recalibrate again as instructed above with no litter in globe and an empty waste drawer. retest with litter in the globe again.\n\nIf it still persists the weight sensor is most likely out of spec and will need to be replaced, luckily its a cheap enough part and can be found [HERE](https://www.robotshop.com/products/litter-robot-3-open-air-cat-sensor).\n\nHope this helps you out?""]"

This is quite helpful to hear!', 'I would suggest paying attention to where your cat pees in the box and watching video reviews of both boxes, particularly ones where you can see the cats use the box. For the 4, one man five cats has an excellent video like this. He also covers other automatic boxes, though I don’t believe a video for the 3 exists from him. For me the LR4 was a clear win, because I have a wall peer, and a smaller cat who could fit in the drawer if she wanted. She’s deaf so she’s fearless, and the 4 can detect motion in the drawer. Hasn’t happened, but it’s great peace of mind. In the 3 the wall peer’s pee would run down the wall as it turned, directly onto a metal pinch detector that would corrode, leading to me having to take the whole box apart (easier said than done, required a special extra long screwdriver and other things) to clean it twice a month, and still had to replace them and the circuit board it was on multiple times before the warranty ran out. For the pinch detectors there was a workaround, but not for the circuit board, and it was much more difficult than fixes I’ve had to make to the 4. In the 4 the gap is much smaller, easily taped over at set up, and the pinch detector is a plastic button. I also had issues with the drawer detection and weight sensors in the 3.\n\nIn the 4 there is a gap where my out the door peer’s pee can get outside of the machine, but that was a much easier fix with an expanded gate that was about 30 dollars and a silicone mat I glued onto it.\n\nMany of the issues of both the LR3 and 4 can be fixed by power cycling it. Many people have it hooked up to a smart or scheduled plug that turns it off and on once a day, which effectively eliminates most of the software issues.\n\nI think the LR4 has more software issues, but many have been getting fixed with updates. LR3 had more hardware issues for me. Again, it’s highly dependent on where your cats pee in the box and how many you have. I think a fair conclusion for me at least was that the heavy use on the LR3 led to rapid hardware issues, whereas that hasn’t been an issue with the 4 so far. By this time with my 3 I’d already had to replace pinch detectors twice.\n\nFor further reference I have 3 cats using the same box in both cases. One wall peer, one regular peer, and one out the door peer. Whatever box you choose, I hope it serves you well!']"

In fact, I found a kitten a few months ago and my husband agreed to let me keep him on the condition that I scoop his litter box. Despite having two children whose diapers I’ve changed countless times, I have a really terrible gag reflex when it comes to animal feces. So I bought a reconditioned litter robot 3 connect off of whisker’s site. I put it in an upside down solid oak tv cabinet, and it’s completely hidden while still being fully accessible. Let me just say, this thing NEVER stinks. I’ve had it for about three weeks now and I’ve only had to add litter once. I’ve changed the drawer out once weekly. It is so easy and so worth it, and because of this, my husband even let me adopt another cat to be a friend to our kitten. He’s always been a “one cat/dog only” kind of guy because he doesn’t like animal smells (who does?) but that’s just how well the litter robot works! I put an air purifier beside it (found at Walmart- $20) and honestly, if I were a stranger and did not see our cats, I would never know we have cats. It’s great!', 'So I actually bought the litter robot bc my dog would hunt for “snickers” at any opportunity lol.

This should continue on for a few minutes with the pinion gear changing directions a few times, then the motor will shut off and you will see the blue yellow and red light all flashing at the same time. this is normal behavior for the circumstances and will tell you if the weight sensor is too sensitive or malfunctioning.

Before doing anything more check to make certain the weight sensor is connected, you will see the black connector behind the metal plate with black and purple wires attached, if its disconnected this could be your issue, if its connected continue on with the diagnostics...

In normal circumstances, if the LR detected resistance it would then proceed to powering up the drive motor. If you have a VOM (volt ohm meter) you can read the resistance the weight sensor has and watch the resistance rise as weight is slowly applied to the base.\n\nJudging by your initial description, I'm almost 99% certain your weight sensor is bad, A VOM will determine this quickly if you get no resistance reading off of it with only the weight of the base.\n\nYou should have something similar to this if measured, (see pic for reference).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmkv49cq4hia1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d27e6c85ac8dd7b691392aae1733eaa733588c24"", 'Just a revision here, after I typed the previous reply I got to thinking how I can help simplify this test process?.

When I did this test I had a bad connection and after fiddling with it then it was powering up to the blue flashing light consistently. \n\nThe end result is to see a change in light behavior by the LR with bypassing the weight sensor.\n\nIf no change?, then it could be the wire harness or control board.

Aside from the bonnet the weight sensor can stop the unit if too heavy so make certain the waste drawer is emptied more frequently and the litter level is at or slightly below the fill line. The other thing that are needed is the unit has to be on a hard level surface and nothing touching the unit on the sides of course. If you have the connect model you can have the app notify you of the faults and its also a huge help if you have a smart outlet in line with the LR, this will allow you if needed to do a hard power cycle of the unit if its stuck and the app wont cycle it but once the glitches are worked through the smart outlet is just an added insurance in the grand scheme of things!\n\nThe cleanliness depends on the litter and the cat, some have success with keeping the inside of the globe clean and others don't and everywhere in-between.

After the interior of the globe is done resume its cycle and then disassemble the LR, wipe the exterior of the globe, bonnet and base down as well. all in all it take me 5 minutes total to clean and I do this every few weeks, My LR's see well over the recommended usage capacity so my cleaning intervals are more frequent than the overall average usage.\n\nHope this helps you out?"", 'Yeah Elsey’s is just so great.

"[""As a test run the LR without the globe, install the bonnet only power it up and then listen to the drive motor, does it sound like its unloaded and freewheeling or does it sound like its really noisy laboring? for this test the motor will run for a while reverse direction then reverse direction once again then when it stops it will flash all 3 lights at once, (this is normal for running like this). \n\nIf the motor sound like its laboring or chattering then there's most likely an issue with the gear box lubrication or it would be the motor electrical connections are loose. \n\nThere also could be loose connectors on the control board if that's the case plug them back in and it should solve the issue. Sometimes when being assembled the three connectors will not have enough wire slack to allow the control board to be slotted in on the cover and fastened with the cover without putting stress on the connectors slightly pulling them out to cause a high resistance connection or be intermittent or worse open with no connection.\n\nAnother possibility which is kind of rare but I've personally had it happen is the pinch detect switch blade connectors had one loose and instead of a pinch detect fault it labored the motor and threw an over torque error, I felt behind the pinch detect switch connections and bumped in to one of the two connections and it fell right off, I crimped the connector a little tighter, pushed it back on and the issue was solved.\n\nHope this helps you out?""]"

If you can't use food, find another reward you can use to encourage them to get get comfortable with the LR. Unless they are desensitized and confident using the LR, you're going to have accidents.""]"
"[""For the LR3 to experience both home and dump position faults both hall effect sensors in the base either didn't see the home and dump position magnets  in the globe or there's an intermittent connection to the sensors.\n\nThe first possibility is the globe key in the back was not in its slot properly, lifting the globe enough for the sensors to not sense the magnets.\n\nSecond is there is so much litter buildup on the base that the globe is being physically lifted high enough at its respective home and dump positions to not detect both magnetic positions, (its actually quite critical the correct distance be maintained for proper operation). Even if it does not detect the magnets the control board has an expected run time that controls the globe movement to assure it reaches the home position in case sensor detection is lost. This is why it was in the right position after the faults but was no longer cycling after use. So cleaning the base unit off of litter might of fixed the issue.\n\nIf the error does return there's the other possibility, the sensor wire connections on the back of the control board is loose and becomes intermittent on occasion. The fix is to plug it back in all the way and be mindful of how much tension the control board is exerting on the wire harness when being fitted in the cover and in to position when the cover is being affixed to the base. Its not all that difficult for one or all 3 plugs to get pulled on enough to either loosen it or disconnect altogether if there isn't enough slack provided in the wire harness when being assembled.\n\nNot knowing if you have the open air or the connect model, but if its the open air there's also the possibility  of bad solder joints, a good number of the control boards connectors didn't have ground anchors that firmly secured the surface mount connector to the control board and could easily develop cold solder joints that would cause various issues including what you are experiencing. I personally had this issue on my first LR, it was an open air model but I was able to re-solder the broken solder joints and this fixed my issue.

"[""Dump position faults are caused by a few things, one of them is the globe's black key in the back isn't in the slot on the base, if its cocked to the side it causes the globe not to be positioned above the sensors correctly and will cause an intermittent or consistent dump position fault.\n\nThe other is because the globe is moving slower than the anticipated run time of the drive motor. The causes of this is buildup of litter on the top of the base impeding the free motion of the globe, the other is the motor is being slowed down due to a lack of sufficient lubrication in the gear box. \n\nI'm going to assume you purchased new, so the most likely cause will be the first two options.

That way if it dumps into the bin you can just reuse it to keep testing. Definitely not ideal but might help.', 'Yeah, it seems odd. It almost seems like the unit is cycling the wrong way or something. A video would definitely help.', ""Cbreezy thanks for all your helpful replies on this thread -  this was basically the answer, turns out I didn't realize a good portion of the grate was clogged up from a messy waste, and the petkit litter stuck inside of it, preventing the litter from falling through the grate fast enough by the time the rotation completed. When I changed litters I didn't notice the clogs. Cleaned them out (disgustingly unfun lol she had a rough digestive weekend) and all is working well. Petkit litter still doesn't fall fast enough for my liking so going to stick to boxiepro"", 'Another vote for what u/importedtea said about a video. What you’re describing doesn’t make sense, especially now that you’ve confirmed you’re not accidentally pressing the button to dump the litter and it’s filled to the proper level.

"['I applaud you for thinking out of the box.  However, even though it SEEMS like you\'d get a lot of offers, you won\'t get any bona fide sale proposals that result in an actual sale of (at least) an LR4 on this forum.  This is because although people come here to complain incessantly and profess they hate for their machines -- as is usual in any product forum --  mostly all of their ""problems"" have been or will be rectified (or more likely, they\'ll eventually understand how their machines work and what they actually can or cannot do).  In other words, folks post here mostly to let off steam and to bluster prematurely.\n\nHowever, you WILL normally find a reasonable number of them available on CraigsList, where -- at least in the case of the LR3s -- owners will sell them because they\'ve purchased and love their advanced LR4s (I WAS going to do that myself, but decided to treat the cats by keeping both).  I doubt you\'ll find any used LR4s for sale anywhere (except the anomaly of a ""fire sale"" when somebody must move quickly, etc.).  \n\nIn any event, best of luck!!  Somebody here or elsewhere should hook you up with at least an LR3!  :-)', '>as is usual in any product forum\n\nWhere do you come up with this stuff?

There's a guy on this site that went all out lambasting our (Whisker's) Litter Robot 4 and even made several YouTubes to that effect (and to his credit, DID buy a Litter Loo Too).  Now HE may want to sell his LR4, but I don't believe anybody else will (as it's much superior to the LR3).  \n\nHmm, actually, I'd LOVE to seen an LLT forum because there'd be just as many posts from people seeking help.

"[""I post about it all the time, lol.  But I'll make it easy for you today.  \n\nMy absolute favorite clay litter is BoxiePro Deep Clean clay for keeping the globe clean + no dust + odor control.  You can find it on Amazon and Chewy if you are in the US.   Use a 15min cycle time for best results if you have a cat that pees a lot (as in high quantity). \n\nSustainably Yours Large Grain (corn + cassava) is also fantastic in the LR, and probably would be my first choice because it clumps like crazy.  However, my cat was allergic and dug bloody holes in front of both of his ears, so definitely watch for itching or respiratory changes. Some people mix it 50/50 with clay to help manage cost, and some people use it at 100%.""]"

"[""Thanks for the good lead. My brand new robot out of the box has two plasticky cracks while rotating to the left 25 % in. No issues when fence is off.

So I looked closer and realized as the globe is rotating to the left , the plastic peace on the globe's wall was coming into contact with the edge of the fence. \n\nSolution : with my hands, I tucked and pushed in the left (inner side) globe's plastic to separate the point of contact and the issue is gone.

['I was having this problem and a few things seem to have helped. I can’t say for certain which thing helped but I haven’t had this problem in over a week (fingers crossed). I took the globe out and vacuumed and wiped down all the pieces. I cleaned all the litter that accumulated in that fuzzy gummy bit near the dump port. Litter gets stuck in there and may be messing with the sensors. I also wiped down the inside of the litter bag to make sure litter isn’t sticking. Lastly I made sure the poop bag sits flush against the wall of the drawer and not poofing out. Once i did that I reset the robot and haven’t had any problems. my guess is your litter is sticking to that sticky and fuzzy strip near the dump port.']
