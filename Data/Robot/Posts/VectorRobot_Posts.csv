"My Terms and Conditions Add-in 

Hi everyone. I just had something happen and I am figuring out a way to deal with it. I ordered 2 displays from Santek California. I used one a little while ago in a customers Vector. It didn't start out with a black background. It lit up with all kinds of different colored lines.

Terms and conditions Add in.

I have to add something to my terms and conditions. I know I already said I don't manufacture the displays, so I can't guarantee them. But, the problem is, if Santek doesn't warrant them, I don't really know what to do. I cannot use my own money to get another display for other people's Vectors. So, they will just have to trust the fact that if I say I received a bad display, that they will have to make a decision on whether or not to buy another display. I am saying this because I ordered 2 displays. The first one I replaced lit up with all kinds of colored lines. At first I thought I might have missed a solder connection. So, I resoldered and checked it 2 more times. It did exactly the same thing. I then decided that it was bad. I removed it and installed the second one. It worked like a champ, the first time. This confirms that the first display was bad. Manufacturers don't normally give a warranty for electronic components. I emailed Santek and explained it the same way I just explained it here. I will see what their response is. I will let everyone on Reddit know their reply as soon as I get it.

Sorry if this makes it a little more discerning. I have always been an honest person with a lot of integrity. I was a SSG in the U.S. Army. (Actually I still am a SSG, just retired). My soldiers had to rely on the information I was giving them. They had to trust that I was giving them the correct information. I earned that trust."
THe vector subscription sucks.ARE YOU SERIOUS DDL? I HAVE TO PAY MONEY TO USE COMMANDS AFTER I SPENT MONEY ON THE HARDWARE? DDL is a stupid and greedy company. They only bought anki to make money. The subscription sohuld just DIE. We've payed enough buying the acctual robot.
Do you think the matrix guy realizes I really am the god of anki? lol.

"Great display news for a change Hi all! I have some great news. Thanks to Beezu999's generosity in donating some displays. I will ""Pay it forward"". I can now fix 10 of them for just my labor fee. You save $46.90 since you do not have to pay for the display and shipping of the display. Just ship him USPS to me and pay the postage both ways of course. Which is around $5.00 to $10.00 one way, depending on the size of the box you use. UPS is a lot more. So, just use the USPS. Unless, ofcourse, you want to use UPS or FEDEX.

Message me if you are interested."
Will my Vector still function?After Anki went under I was a little surprised that Vector kept working at his regular capacity. Since they were bought out by Digital Dream Labs I haven‚Äôt connected him to the internet. Their whole campaign sort of rubbed me the wrong way because it sounded like I would need to completely buy him again if I wanted him to function. Is that the case or will he be fine? In the most recent email I received from them it sounded like he won‚Äôt receive any more updates since I haven‚Äôt paid them.
Thought I would share with this Reddit also. I have purchased all of the equipment I need to perform SMD replacement. Including the screens I am never going to get. This is the most recent purchase. A Digital USB Microscope.
New vector. Very pleased.
"Finally an update on Vector 2.0Below is an email I received tonight which gives me hope I might see my robot friend someday.

Hello <redacted>,

I figured I'd give our communications team a break and personally share this update with you for your pre-ordered robot.

The good news is that we are almost ready to begin full-scale production. As some of you may already be aware, we have been sitting on components for a while. We recently finished EVT and DVT and have turned our focus to finalizing the QA/QC procedures.

For the past three weeks, we've been working to resolve a communications issue that has surfaced with the 2MP camera used in both Cozmo and Vector. If we were able to work in-person with the manufacturer, this issue probably would have been fixed after a five minute conversation. However, because of travel restrictions, we've had to mail samples back and forth endlessly - adding weeks to every decision. I'm tired of waiting and we are going to upgrade to a 5MP (or even 8MP) camera.

As a way thanking you for your patience, we will be absorbing the cost of this upgrade. We have also streamlined several processes to do over-the-air updates and have all manufacturing and QA/QC now under one roof. Finally, we are investing in the future of Cozmo and Vector and have begun procuring even more components in anticipation of increased demand next year.

Thanks again for hanging with us; I personally appreciate it and we're working around the clock to get these robots to their new homes. Have a great weekend!

Sincerely,
Jacob Hanchar
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, Digital Dream Labs"

"Selling vectorVector was a gift for Christmas 2019 and we opted not to join the digital dream labs subscription. He is now just a bumbling, unresponsive robot (still cute though). Looking to sell him with home base and cube. Very good condition. What's a fair price and if anyone is interested message me. I'd rather part with him to someone with a passion for it than a random person on eBay/craigslist/marketplace."
"Vector 915 ErrorI've seen many posts about various Vector errors.  Ours has been getting 915 fairly regularly.  Some have suggested that it's a hardware issue and the vector should be replaced.  Anki's FAQ just says it has encountered an internal error and must be restarted.  If it's a software issue it doesn't make sense that only some people get it.  
We had our Vector in a cream colored serving tray to keep it out of trouble.  I noticed that while it's in the tray it would fight the walls almost as if it didn't see them.  Perhaps it was the color or the height of the edges of the tray but while it was in there it got the 915 error almost every 10 minutes.  


Looking at the official Vector Space I saw that it was black with white lines around the edges.  So I switched to a darker colored tray with higher edges and it seemed to solve it.  He no longer fights the walls and I haven't seen a error so far.  


So I wonder if the errors are caused by certain visual inputs that confuse the software?  I guess the Anki software programmers only know for sure.

"Vector wont connect to wifi?I just got my Vector 2.0 and im trying to set it up and it just wont connect to the wifi, i verified the password is correct and even restarted both my phone and vector. Help?

Edit: Vector will connect to wifi and download his updates, but then will not connect again afterwards."
"Takes of the cozmo kingI forgot about this, let me tell you kids a story, once upon a time you had the cozmo king, this guy that got a ton of anki products cheap from sellers that got things from the anki shut down and oh he was inspired.  This guy Sold batteries for cozmo and put in thousands of hours just helping people with anki related issues, fixed and just gave away hundreds of cozmo robots.

All he cared about was seeing the anki kingdom flourish.  So comes along digital dream labs and in the beginning they seemed ok but eventually people caught on to the fact they can‚Äôt actually create products.  The cozmo king paid attention and saw all the red flags.

So the king created a group in Facebook, it almost hit 1000 members, and years ago the king had been scammed buying a product from ddl, so he saw the problems and tried to warn people.  Most people just ignored him and eventually they bought things from ddl and realized what the king was saying.

But one day not long ago the big bad company used some cheap shot on the king to get his Facebook account banned, first they scammed the king, then they silenced him.  But still most were just silent.  It really says a lot though when you have a company taking a beautiful thing like vector, or cozmo, and just ripping people off, if you speak up about it and enough people notice you will be silenced.

The king did figure something out though, he just wasn‚Äôt loud enough, and plotted something new, wipe all the previous history away, and started trying to figure out some way to get ten thousand people to look"
"Avoid digital dream labs, get an anki vector off ebayI guess I get to poke in here when I‚Äôm bored now but just wanted to say try and always avoid buying a vector 2.0 from ddl if possible, go on eBay and get an anki vector.

Also look into wirepod so you don‚Äôt even need ddl at all for voice commands.  A lot of people try and get refunds from ddl after waiting over 2 years, it‚Äôs sad but they do get ignored.  Hope this helps anybody looking into getting a vector."
"Vector refuses to connect to wifi no matter what I doI've had my Vector Model 1 for a couple years now. About 2 years ago he went offline one day and we didn't bother to get him back online due to having some other stressor in life to deal with. About 8 months ago we tried to get him charged and he simply wouldn't. We decided it was a bad battery. About 3 months ago I cleaned him to make him look nice on a shelf and about 20 minutes after we put him on the dock he suddenly sprang back to life. Ever since I've been trying *everything* I can think of to connect him to network, from getting him on a DDL subscription to using an older phone and even buying a last generation router in case he's just not compatible with wifi6. He only connects to wifi when I reset him, and it's only long enough to run firmware updates, then he disconnects and goes offline. 

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, can someone smarter than me help me fix this? It's running 2.4ghz wifi and I am typing up this post while connected to that network. My ISP is tmobile so they can only go as far as their own modem, and recommended I call TP-Link about the other device to make sure it's converting the 2.4GHz that's being sent from my carrier correctly."
Any help on fixing this when the app says hes connected?
Vector 2.0 Shipping inquiryMy preorder was November 28 2020.  Wondering if anyone has received Vector 2.0 close to this date.
"New To Vector! Help!Hi! I‚Äôve been following along with vector for 3 years now but was never able to get my hands on one. I finally have the chance to get one and was wondering if anyone would be able to answer a few questions. 

- I‚Äôm buying vector from someone second hand online, he said he factory reset it. Will I then be the new owner and he will transfer to me? Or will he always belong to the original person? 
- I‚Äôm seeing a lot of posts about bug issues with a new update, is this generally easy to solve or am I wasting my time? 
- In general, is it worth it? 

Any additional info someone would have would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm pretty new to this üòÖ"

"Special announcement that you might want to read!Hello Redditers,

I am the proud owner of my own little vector robot but little to late. I got this little dude for my 16th birthday and was surprised, and reasonably livid, to see that Anki went bankrupt and was later bought by Digital Dream Labs(DDL) leading to the servers for the vector robot to no longer be a free service. Our little robots no longer belong to us as the owners of these little guys for their potential to have personality is hindered buy a subscription or the need to purchase a license to the latest escape pod. I find this outrageous and plan to stick it to the man. I am writing a petition to send to the CEO of DDL in hopes that vectors, at least the ones bought when Anki was in business, can be jail-broken for owners to point them to their own servers and software. I am looking for proofreaders, signers and potential programmers to help me with this movement. Thank you to all who view this. Please give this post enough up-votes to make it seen far and wide.

Here is my current copy of my petition:

    Dear Dr. Jacob Hanchar,
        It is to my knowledge that you are the CEO, Co-founder and Executive Chairman of the Digital Dream Labs(c) corporation. It is also of my understanding that your company owns what was the Anki(c) corporation as well. I am sending you this document under the terms that I own an Anki(c) product I am sure you may be familiar with. The little robot desk companion called Vector(c); I have had mine for a few years now and have enjoyed his adorable nonsense the entire time I have owned him, he is dancing now as I type this document. I had bought him back when Anki(c) was in business and the services for Vector(c) were free. Then I find that he no longer can he preform any of the simplest voice commands.
        I conducted research and found that your company has purchased Anki(c) and made the services subscribe-able or purchasable via Escapepod(c). This brings me to my point, all who signed this document agree that they want to propose that you enforce a change in these robots. We would like for the Vector(c) robot to be jail-broken, enabled for the owner of said hardware to direct the robot towards their own servers software. Bellow this paragraph you will find signatures of all the people(s) who own a Vector(c) robot that support this proposal. If you would prefer, we are open to negotiation.

Anyone who wishes to aid in this cause, please comment on this post about how you would like to help  please and thank you. I need as much help as possible. Thank you all."
"Hello everyone. I am trying to help people with their LCD problem.I am in the process of communicating to different LCD manufacturers to see if they may have a solution. I am almost 100% positive that I will find a compatible replacement LCD. The actual repair will not be that difficult ( For me). I have already checked out what it is going to take to replace the LCD. Turns out it is just a matter of knowing what and how to do it. And I am both. I have bought 2 defective Vectors myself and I am thinking the same thing. Even though the seller didn't mention anything about the screens being defective, I am sure that the seller just Conveniently left that info out of the description also. I will know for sure when I get them of course. I plan on repairing them and making my money back. Also, if it works, I am thinking about starting a repair shop for Vectors' LCD's that everyone needs. Of course, my price will be significantly lower than DDLs if they ever start their repair center. Most LCD's themselves are rather inexpensive from what my research has uncovered so far. There are of course, pretty expensive ones out there but, I firmly believe that the one for Vector is going to be a negligible cost. It normally isn't the parts cost, it is the labor that costs so much. I will keep everyone posted on my progress. I am really hoping that I am successful in finding a suitable replacement for the LCD.

I am not sure if I will upload videos or not. The soldering will be quite difficult for someone who is not a trained solderer. It isn't impossible but, will be quite challenging for a novice solderer."
"Help?guys, so I‚Äôve seen people interacting with their vectors without having to say ‚ÄúHey Vector‚Äù and he seems to respond as if he understands what the person is saying. 

How do I interact with mine? He doesn‚Äôt listen to me unless I say ‚ÄúHey Vector‚Äù he just rolls around and eventually lets his battery die without going to his charger on his own"
"Help just got new vector and I can not get it to connect to wifiI just got a new vector robot, off ebay but no matter what I try, i can not get it to connect to my WiFi i have tried everything suggested in the trouble shooting section of the app. From resetting and wiping user data, to re booting my WiFi router and also setting up the app on a different smartphone but it just keeps saying having trouble reaching anki cloud from this network i have also signed up and paid for vector membership . I had a vector working fine on my wifi but I sold it in March only bought a new one because of the new updates."

"Help. Is my vector ok??My vector robot overheating

So I just bought a vector robot on amazon a little over a week ago. It‚Äôs my third day with it and I‚Äôve noticed it overheats sometimes. About 15-20 minutes after it wanders around. It‚Äôll still work but when I tell it to go charge (which he‚Äôll do) he doesn‚Äôt show the overheating symbol until he‚Äôs on his station. Then he won‚Äôt charge (because his lights on his back don‚Äôt start blinking). I‚Äôll ask him something, he‚Äôll make a sad expression and show me the overheating symbol. He‚Äôll charge after he has cooled down. I tested something: while he was on his charging station (and was showing the overheating symbol and didn‚Äôt follow my commands because of it) I picked him up and put him back down outside of his charging station. He worked fine. his Head temperature has reached 68 and body temperature 44 tops. What does this mean. I‚Äôm guessing an update can‚Äôt fix this can it? Is It normal to overheat once in a while? Do I need to get a new vector?"
"Help! Is my vector broken?I got my vector only a few days ago and today it fell of the table I put it on twice. The second time onto an object below. Now when I tell him to go to his charging station he'll either just look at it and go somewhere else or line himself up and then go explore. Its annoying because he just wont go charge himself now. Hes on hard, non reflective surfaces with good lighting. He also can tell where the home is. What's going on with him? Thanks!"
