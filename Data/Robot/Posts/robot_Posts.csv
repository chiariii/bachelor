"After Colony and Anno Domini Mobile Suit/Armour Categorisation in Accordance with Contemporary Military ClassificationHello robot enthusiasts, I am known as Freighttrain and I have made two blog posts on the Gundam wiki where I have categorised most of the mobile suits and armours from the [**After Colony**](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Freighttrain,_The/After_Colony_Mobile_Suit/Armour_Categorisation_in_Accordance_With_Contemporary_Military_Classification_Using_Adjusted/Improvised_Terminology) and [**Anno Domini**](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Freighttrain,_The/Anno_Domini_Mobile_Suit/Armour_Categorisation_in_Accordance_With_Contemporary_Military_Classification_Using_Adjusted/Improvised_Terminology) timelines in accordance with contemporary military classification using adjusted and/or improvised terminology, as no nation or other military force has such vehicles in their arsenal... yet.

A primary focal point of this classification system is on how contemporary militaries would classify a vehicle such as a mobile suit, I propose the term SHMV (Super-heavy Humanoid Military Vehicle) or 'shumvee' as when using a size/chassis/battlespace format, that is the most succinct, comprehensive and appropriately ambiguous designation that I have been able to derive from contemporary military classification thus far and I am particularly interested in comments regarding that.

I have listed all of the mobile/suits armours from Anno Domini and most of those featured in media from After Colony with the exception of some obscurities that either lack sufficient information and/or have designs or capabilities that are exotic beyond what I would call hard science fiction. Though it is possible I may add such examples later.

I am particularly interested in comments regarding the comprehensiveness, accuracy or terminology of my classification system as well as the battlespace viability and distinctive equipment of any vehicles and please also feel free to also leave a comment on the actual blog post page if you have a profile on the Gundam wiki.

"Characteristics and Classification of Industrial Robots 

Industrial robots have changed from a ""luxury"" that only large enterprises can use to many small and medium-sized enterprises. Industrial robots have become the most common tool in the production process. The industrial robot  has the potential to expand horizontally and promote all industries. It can be seen that industrial robots will eventually become the inevitable choice of manufacturing companies, and future development will inevitably make industrial production and even human society undergo earth-shaking changes.

So what are the characteristics of industrial robots? JRPanel summarizes three characteristics for everyone.

**Characteristics of industrial robots:**

1. **Programmable**

The further development of production automation is flexible automation. Industrial robots can be reprogrammed according to the changing needs of their working environment. Therefore, they can play a very good function in the flexible manufacturing process of small batches and multiple varieties with balanced and high efficiency. It is an important part of the flexible manufacturing system (FMS).

2. **Personification**

Industrial robots have parts similar to human walking, waist turning, big arms, forearms, wrists, and claws in the mechanical structure, and they are controlled by computers. In addition, intelligent industrial robots have many human-like ""biological sensors"", such as skin-type contact sensors, force sensors, load sensors, vision sensors, acoustic sensors, language functions, etc. The sensors improve the adaptive ability of industrial robots to the surrounding environment.

3. **Versatility**

In addition to specially designed dedicated industrial robots, general industrial robots have better versatility when performing different tasks. For example, changing the hand end manipulators (claws, tools, etc.) of an industrial robot can perform different tasks.

**Here are some advantages of industrial robots:**

**Save costs**

The robot can be operated for 24 hours. Effectively save labor costs. In addition, using the mode of industrial manipulator operation, the automatic assembly line can save more space, making the whole plant planning smaller and more compact.

**High productivity**

The time it takes for a robot to produce a product is fixed. During the same life cycle, the output of using the manipulator is also fixed, and will not fluctuate. Moreover, the production time of each mold is fixed, and the yield of the product is also high. The use of robots is more in line with the interests of the enterprise.

**High safety factor**

The use of manipulators for production can guarantee the work safety of workers to a greater extent. There will be no accidents due to work negligence or fatigue. The use of industrial robots has higher accuracy, higher stability, and stronger safety, which can ensure the safety of personnel.

**Easy to manage**

In the past, it was difficult to accurately guarantee the daily production volume in enterprises, because the attendance and work efficiency of employees are variables and are easily interfered by external factors. However, after the use of robots for production, the number of employees is reduced, and employee management and production management are carried out more efficient for the company.

There are many types of industrial robots, which can be simply divided into the following categories according to the classification.

**Spot welding robot:**

The welding robot has the characteristics of stable performance, large working space, fast movement speed and strong load capacity. The welding quality is obviously better than manual welding, which greatly improves the productivity of spot welding operations.

**Laser processing robot**

Laser processing robots apply robotic technology to laser processing, and realize more flexible laser processing operations through high-precision industrial robots. The system can be operated online or programmed offline.

**Clean robot**

A clean robot is an industrial robot used in a clean environment. As the level of production technology continues to improve, its requirements for the production environment are becoming increasingly stringent. The production of many modern industrial products requires a clean environment. Clean robots are the key equipment required for production in a clean environment."

"Looking for a particular type of toy robot, suggestions?Hello!

I am looking for a toy/hobby robot or maybe even a drone type device that does the following:

\- can be programmed to perform any type of ground level movement for long periods of time

\- has some type of sensor that detects if it will bump in to a surface and re-route itself automatically 

\- is physically sturdy and durable, made of material that will not break easily 

\- low barrier to entry in terms of programming the route, if it came with an easy to use app or remote control that would be great (I have no programming background)

\- preferably pre-made so I don't have to build anything

\- preferably under $110 USD or ballpark

Looking for suggestions! If anyone has any would really appreciate it.

Thanks!"

"Robot competition (PhaseDock)Hey Redditors,

A friend of mine makes fun and interesting robots.

This fall he's in the process of doing a full renovation of one of his favorite robots: TARA  After 4 previous revisions of the hardware he's taking the time clean up the electronics and tighten down the connections.  Revising the design so that she responds faster and travels lighter.

To do this he's using an electronics project base called PhaseDock.  It lets him mount components on a grid so that he can move things around and reorganize the layout until it is perfect.  It's a good product.  The company is owned by a nice couple who are just trying to take a good idea to market.

Well, PhaseDock launched a competition for some cool new PhaseDock gear.  One of the prizes will be chosen by Dale Dougherty... the founder of Make Magazine and Maker Faire.  The more votes he get the better his chances.

So this is post to help my buddy get some exposure to his fun and cool robot (TARA), and potentially help him win a cool control module!

If you get a chance please surf out to this site and vote for TARA as a PhaseDock project:

(Make sure you change the rating at the bottom from ‘No Rating’ to ‘+1’!)

Thanks for being awesome!

"Searching for a robotDear fellows,

for a course in our university i am searching up robots and maybe some of you can help to choose.Currently we have the E-Puck (Version 1 i guess not the new one on ESP32 Basis)The new robot should be similiarThat means:

* it should drive on wheels
* have multiple sensors for distance measurementaround the whole body, not only in the front
* a camera would be nice
* maybe other sensors as bonus
* It should be possible to access the function by writing C/C++ Code.Main task of the students is to create GUI for the Robot in QT so an API would be useful.
* the robot  is to be driven through a labyrinth only via the GUI (therefore the sensors)
* Prize would be best around 100-200 (€ or $ or similiar)
* EDIT: Connection to a PC via Bluetooth or WiFi necessary!

I found a few candidates already, but if some of you habben to know a robot of this kind or where to specificly search for it, i would  appreciate it much.

Best Regards"

"Robot Children’s animation movie?For the past few weeks I have been remembering a movie I had watched as a kid. I have looked countless times on Google trying to find it and I have asked many family members but they can’t seem to remember it. 
The movie is just robots it has no humans in it and it is quite a low quality movie. From what I can remember it starts with a little robot working in a sort of factory or office cleaning, he finds something out or he just finds something that he shouldn’t and goes home to tell his robot dad and then the robot police come but they get his dad and he runs away. He finds a group of other misfit robots and then I can’t remember anything else after that. My family seem to think I’ve made it up or dreamt it and I’m starting to think I might have as well. Any help would be great thank you! Also I don’t have a clue when it could if come out as I don’t remember how young I was when I watched it but I’m assuming it was before 2010."

"Engineering survey to help a student MBA teamhey guys, 
I could realllly use some help on this. need some smart minds where my business mind lacks. any help would be awesome!!!


I am a MBA student at California State University, Northridge. As my culminating experience in the program, I am part of a team of MBA students that is working as a business consulting group for a local company. Our client manufactures unique technology that fuses high-quality uncompressed video with precise time stamping, and accommodates a huge array of other user-defined parameters, such as temperature, pressure, windspeed, camera angle, etc. Our client already sells to organizations such as the US Military and other government agencies, NASA, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Cessna, Lear, Northrop Grumman, and more. The company’s equipment provides invaluable, unparalleled video-analysis capabilities for many engineering and testing applications. Part of our role as consultants is to help our client discover new use-cases and markets for his technology. 
I am reaching out to you to see if you would be willing to help us in our research by completing this very brief survey and distributing it among your colleagues. Any help would be tremendously appreciated. Thank you for your time.
Just click on this link to access the survey:

"How different is industrial robotics from academic / exploration robotics?I've been toying around with robots for about 10 years.  Just your basic line followers, servo arms and lego league stuff.  I then started mentoring the high school FIRST robotics teams for a while and finally my current job a local company heard I built 3d printers and robots and hired me to do 6 axis CNC programming and automation.    


It seems to be completely different.  It's all about frames and zones and repeatability. To be honest it's incredibly boring but pays incredibly well.    


So my question is when you get to robots with JOBS - like the Opportunity an the other rovers - are they still using frames and kinematics, or is that just something industrial robots need to be concerned with?"
