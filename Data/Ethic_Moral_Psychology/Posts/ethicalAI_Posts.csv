"Will artificial intelligence save humanity, or supersede it? A vanguard is carving a path on AI governance"
"Thoughts on workforce impact. Theory that people losing job because of AI is bad, because having a job is good, as without job yo won't have money to survive is in my opinion a flawed outlook.It does not present the full picture, and is very limited in the scope, but I hear it very often. I think it also has to do with the general idea behind this sub so I would like to hear some opinions on that.

My thoughts:

AI replacing people would cause unemployment. I would argue that it is not a bad thing. To keep it simple I would go with a parallel to child labor in 19th and early 20th century.

Back then a mine owner could argue:

""If we don't allow children to work in the mines, they will lose jobs. They won't have money to support their families and buy food for themselves. Only misery awaits for these children that don't have a job. My mine needs at least 500 children to operate, and they don't complain, because with this system they have bread on their table. I also have 500 children working for me in the field, digging potatos, their work is needed so that we can survive! And they also getpaid for it so they can buy their own potatos, isn't that great?""

Here I want to emphasize that I admit, I wanted to appeal to emotion a bit, because we feel naturally that obviously children shouldn't work, even if there's no one to help them when they are no longer earning money, community should feed them and give them proper living conditions, as they shouldn't be required to earn money to survive in the first case.

Let's skip the part about how child labor was finally outlawed, and focus on alternative system that could come after it - a system where no children work, a set of machines with little to no operators work in the mines and fields (or even robots do that), and all mined materials are processed automatically, and all potatos are given to everyone, or everyone receives some food stamps or money so they can have some potatos out of communal pool that is filled by machines. Someone would have to design the machines, luckily now we have them, In this scenario, almost everyone lost their job, but their lifes didn't suffer. I would argue that some adults today are in similar situation to these children - required to work to have income to survive, and can lose their income. Why not treat them as we treated the children?
It's not like it's their fault that other people still have to work their jobs, and after all they are losing some quality of life, on the contrary everyone's life is better because another process is automated.

To be fair, most likely the children would suffer from loss of job at first, if systemic changes don't follow. But soon, they now have time for education and being children, and because we have machines working the fields, they parents can buy potatos for cheaper, and spend their money on other things.

It tends to happen to some extend naturally - whole fields of work deemed redundant over last 100 years, while commodities like electricity, water, access to healthcare, access to knowledge/internet, food are becoming more accessible to people that don't work, than say 200 or even 50 years ago.

Future goes slowly towards having even more shared commodities/services produced by machines.

Automation works like this - a few get inconveniences, but many gain profits. It will continue untill there are no jobs left.

It is not unethical to have someone stop working because of that. It is only unethical if he does not get compensated as everone else for the work that machine does via some welfare programs, like UBI or food stamps, depending on how advanced your country is.

And we have these systems already. Like a king could order to send grain to a city in need of food, because he had stocks of grain farmed with use of tools and animal power. Ancient humans living in caves could not do that, because they did not have ways to create and transport such large amounts of food. Now instead of food we have manufacturing, information, design. Will our rulers allow us to benefit from the fruits of work that are multiplied with use of tools like AI? I think yes. Take a look at countries using free healthcare - diagnostic and treatment methods povered by AI would be available to everyone.  AI helping with food farming and supply routes would increase availability of food, so tha you would not have issues to buy it even if you did not have a job. These small steps are taking us to a future where you work only to fulfill your need of doing something interesting, and receiving only limited 'pay' for it, because our civilisation already solved most of the stuff for us. We don't really see it but some of these things are already solved, thought mostly in a flawed way. I can for 99%  say that in following days have clothes on you. We take them for granted now. Even if you lost them in a day or two you would find new clothes - via internet, charity, second hand shop, next to trash bin, or with help of someone who has access to above. Same goes for water and food in developed countries. It already expands to education and internet. It is almost impossible to be in a situation where you don't have access to these things, even the poorest countries. 50% of people in Africa own a phone - some of them have poor phones, some are damaged, but still. I hope we can soon see the times it fully expands towards housing, travel, electronics, commodities and services. Having these provided with help of AI would make people not need to go to work to survive, just as nowadays you don't need 100 people in the field to grow wheat, you just send one guy to remotely operate 10 self driving harvesters by planning their routes on a tablet and tracking them via GPS.

To sum up:

Impact on people now - some people will lose jobs to AI, and may have worse lives if the system/country does not support them. This impacts a group of people working affected field, and living in current times.

Impact on people in future - we remove another required field of work, there is less work to be done, another set of jobs has been delegated to the machines, making it so effective that next commodity/service produced is basically avaialble via your smartphone, who knew. A few years ago you had to write a personal request and wait for a few months for a team of craftsmen to process it, now an AI does it in 3 seconds. The cost dropped by 95% but the developers still make great money, so everybody can have it now. You save money on this service now and spend it on things that are still not sufficiently automated yet. This impacts the whole world over many generations.

I know this is a lot of text, just wanted to hear some opinions on the topic, as the general idea of the sub seems to concern ethics of AI in relation to Human Resources - so I guess a topic pretty close to what I'm describig here."
